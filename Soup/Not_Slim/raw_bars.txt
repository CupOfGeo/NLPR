<i>[angela mccluskey (kendrick lamar)]</i>
sit still and close your eyes (smoke to it)
what's behind the other door? oh-ohh
no more silence (no more silence)
don't kill this thing we got called love (don't shoot)
just searching for the perfect shot

<i>[kendrick lamar (angela mccluskey)]</i>
i used to write rhymes all day and all night
when y'all was playing playstation, my pencil was erasing lines
my conscience only knew what's half-tight
at three:fourteen, it's time to get me a slice my nigga
this is a dog's fight my nigga
the soundtrack to life my nigga
kendrick lamar, his momma called him that
he watched house party and ate apple jacks
he sold sega games, his cousin sold crack
he pumped reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
punk fake, jump-shot, ball hit the back
ball dreams of being point guard was off limits jack
that's because these compton streets was built not to win
you killed the nigga, i stole a bible, is that a sin?
part of me though, i'm searching for answers (just searching for the perfect shot)
the good kid from the ugly city that's mad that he's had some
where is the love?

<i>[kendrick lamar (angela mccluskey)]</i>
give me rings, give me chains mayne
give me a blue benz, red porsche, red range
give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
a mansion with marble floors and security codes
then give me some landa, or maybe i'll land a
gfive, clear port, say hello to the man
give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud
my name till they strain the veins in they vocal chords
give me fame and fortune, me and trump on golf courses
with that being said, give me tiger's sports endorsements
give me billboards, whatever that people would kill for
manhattan at forty/forty, no forties but rose poured
give me vanity, give me kurt cobain sanity
give me a city where channel seven newscasters' cameras be
give me horror like amity, no, give me the charts (just searching for the perfect shot)
and if you ever renege, i'll still give you kendrick lamar
this is me, and that's love

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
now everybody smoke to it
for this is, the celebration


<i>[verse one:]</i>
gimme that beat, fool

so really i ain't gotta steal nothing all i gotta do is kill it when you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
i came back with a full time swag and the critics thought they had me

turned up supercharged, a medium away from livin' large
matter fact, where my niggas at?
where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one i'm on one i'll make sure your kids breathe ammonia
good kid, mad city evil in my heart from the blood niggas fuckin' with me crip niggas tryna kill me
malcolm x mind state, if i raise the crime rate, it's a legitimate reason why i put on repeat kanye's "touch the sky"
but i'll be looking passed that i'm tryna touch god
my heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
ya'll married to the game well i'm bout to crash weddings
i put a lot of pain in the shit i write
if you goin' through something, this is shit you recite
this is bigger than life
this is kendrick lamar
this is jimi hendrix guitar on tall <i>[?]</i> i mean war like that
yeah, straight like that

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse two:]</i>
in two thousand and ten i'm tryna ball, nigga!

that's a quote from ab-soul i suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
on behalf of the top dawg conglomerate

searchin' seven continents accomplishing big shit
big ass, big tits she on me
and just to get to me she'll fuck the homies-homie's homies
the life of a cool nigga
my nigga tony said "just do you, nigga!"

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse three:]</i>
why ya'll complain about og's?
i don't look at a legend and say you owe me
not snoop not dre not ice cube
i don't care me and quik went to the same school
i look at the mirror and do it myself like a self made nigga
i don't need a maid, nigga
do i need a cosign from dre or jigga?
they can make me much bigger, but do i need em though?
i just made a flow
the type of shit that make you think you seen pac ghost "me against the world" on you motherfuckers
i got my back against the wall and a .forty-five, dog get smoked, chris tucker
uhh, tryna record my steelo
even when i'm not there just like tivo
the hoes tell me that i got a real big ego
and weed move slow right now but e go

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
oh, what up hoe? oh, what up?
i said, oh, what up hoe? oh, what up?
i said, oh, what up hoe? oh, what up?
well alright

<i>[chorus xtwo: kendrick lamar]</i>
i'm going through something with life
where pussy and patron make you feel alright
pussy and patron make you feel alright
pussy and patron, that's some great advice

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
something to inspire me, rather than society's
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
i want diamonds too, ronnie on player's club
i used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was 'five
that bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then, i had no job
pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on rosecrans
trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
guilty by association, story of my life nigga!
you gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga!
pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at louie's burgers
hold my tears, i tried my best, let it go, drench my pullover
cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin
maintaining my modest-modest as i dream
so while i go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it
life itself, i know it helps, let me scroll through my blackberry

<i>[chorus xtwo]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
i said, keep reading my diary when my life's entirely
surrounded by the irony of living in the city
i said they wouldn't hire me, i said i got my ass beat
and the only thing can help is ass and some titties
so what's up baby? i said what's up?
i had a long day and i really wanna fuck
see i ain't tryna think about no phone bills, credit card late fees
capital one popping up on my caller i.d.
pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow tip shots
watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
man, that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear?
you know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
or run through a pothole at two in the morning
scared to hit your emergencies, cause then they'll be on it
see i know, when the harsh reality takes toll
open up your contacts, then scroll ("hey what's up daddy? ")

<i>[chorus xtwo]</i>

<i>[ab-soul:]</i>
welcome to my diary, hmm, where should i begin?
finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve
cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd
like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtleneck
convertibles with turbo jets fueled by seven up and prometh'
i feel like death's around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
so i took another shot, tequila hit me like a nina (blaow!)
my sky's gray, my bitch is brighter
always saying "lights please", j. cole's her ghostwriter
and i'm the god mc, join my diocese
free ya mind, don't mind so-ciety
and finally, everyone got their own problems
everything's subject to change like broken dollars
i'm a, drown in my drink and swim in woman's vagina
like a pirahna fin, it gets harder than rihanna when

<i>[chorus xtwo]</i>


<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
one time
reporting live, compton, california

she go to work, she go to school
her body smooth, no tattoos
type of girl that make your mother feel comfortable
my pops love her too, she's compatible
she's independent, she handle her business
she believe in god and no other religions
never in competition when it comes to her friends
she's dependable, she set her own trends
a confidant, a mediator
so sweet, every flavor
just a conversation with her, doing you a favor
look at her hips, i want to be her pager
conservative, affirmative
action when she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
the beauty of her, a blind man could see
a true queen, and she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
the beauty of her, swear to god a blind man could see
a true queen, and she needs me

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
five years later, an accounting major
work at a firm, abundance of paper
she got a career, she look in the rear-
view mirror of a mercedes that she can steer
private bars, executive meetings
consecutive trips, vacation on weekends
dior reeking through her prada dress
probably the only product of a pure success
got a promotion, now she own the building
headed to the top like she on the building
real estate, property
she do tender steak, only one mouth to feed
funded a youth center, invested in some stock
doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
oh what a girl, how great life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
we lose touch, separated
years pass, i'm out dating
she's dating, one of hollywood's
famous of entertainers, denzel good
paparazzi spot 'em out shopping
tuesday morning brunch, benihana's
tabloids paint the picture of a perfect couple
headline reads, when a famous actor loves you
emmy awards, academy too
on the red carpet, dress matching his suit
she holding his arm, she wave at her moms
then wave at the world, got the world in her palms
head in the clouds, star-gazing
caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
he bent down, got on one knee
she looked him in the eye, and said she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
even if we seem to separate, eventually
it'll come to pass, and she'll need me
i need her... we need we

<i>[chorus]</i>


see y'all don't understand me
my plan be is to win y'all hearts before i win a grammy
kendrick lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a spartan
marching on rosecrans in compton
you can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
i'm on point like period
i've been there and gone before you get near it
ooh wee, that young boy remind me of a young martin luther
the way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
like malcolm x did, i stand for what i believe in
family, god and honor
from chicago, my daddy and my momma
came to compton to accomplish one thing
raise a king, reign supreme, named kendrick
i ain't lying, it stand for king and i am one
my unborn son and grandson will live royal
from the coochie to the soil
the meek shall inherit the earth
well i've had this world since birth
feel the good kid's hunger
the crips made strong, the pirus made stronger
muscle in my heart
stare at the eyes of mozart, then tell him i'm the genius
do my dougie and grab my penis
cause i means this with all my soul
and you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of satan
but even that can't stop it
nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
passion in your life, the passion of my christ is in me
and if you say it ain't, you may offend me
damn that boy good
bright as thomas edison, but gucci manhood
he stood alone for so long
prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
you can shoot shots or cheer cause i... am


<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
it's like i don't think you fully understand who i am, y'know?
i'm just a good kid from compton that wanna rap
i don't represent no colors, i represent my lil' sisters and brothers
i'm the oldest, nigga
and if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
check it out

i used to wanna rap like jay-z
until i finally realised that jay wasn't me
i took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
critics say i don't be killing this shit but i know i do
because i used to practice early morning and then after school
i'm working on my hooks my nigga, i ain't tryna battle you
but even if i did, i guarantee i'd overshadow you
like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
i'ma close cut to common and gucci mane
now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
because i can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
as an 'eighty-seven regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
i wear a heart on my shoulder
'member when we used to make the boost look like motorola?
your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
then went to jail when we got older
that shit is a bad odor, but still i remain focussed
in due time, i'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
that shit's embarrassing huh
hope no one pay you no mind
but it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
can you relate to my story? can you follow my dreams
and admirations that i had ever since i was thirteen?
my momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
even though she know her tank is empty, that's who i do it fo'
my pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
but he always questioned when i'ma drop my debut cd
how long this gon' take nigga? you still haven't ate nigga
at twenty-two i had two cars and my own place nigga
it's a sacrifice i try to tell him
that's when he turn to bet and tell me that he jealous
of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
i ate tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
i just wanna hear you heard

<i>[chorus]</i>
yep, yep, that's my word
make a statement with these nouns and verbs
i represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
listen to my nouns and verbs (man i wanna be heard)
like a cattle with sheep
while y'all sleep i re-up, cooking up all day
like a mad scientist in that laboratory
motherfuck what a critic got to say, i'ma be heard

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
what up dasan? i ain't forgot nigga
you developed me, telling me i was hot nigga
you believed in me first, that's what's for sure
at the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
but me and dave kind of felt you lost the passion
a lot was going on in your life and you needed space
but still i should have came to you first to tell you what happened
but i was seventeen and figured it's best i stay away
and i wrong, i was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what i'd done
but i'm telling you we ain't done
matter of fact, how's your sons? what they up to?
remember they used to run away while you had worked on protools?
people i used to be in the booth till four in the morning
with school in the morning, yawning, but i was on it
me, you and dave was on it
buzzing like charlotte hornets when that tape dropped
where them beats nigga? it's been five years since we had rocked
time to be heard

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
so can you feel it?
when you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
does it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
the truth can set you free if you do the right thing
word to spike lee, don't he look like sounwave?
that's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays, like a dog in the night
twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
to grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
i spread love like a hippy, but i'm a (black) one
with jesus christ passion, i swear on the bible
tabernacle to all my rivals, i ain't mad
you hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
because i figure i can make a way with these stanzas
i probably can't heal cancer, but i can heal the city
my niggas, tell me you with me
and if you is won't you pop my cd in
open up your trunk, then let it bump, so i can be heard
yeah, uh huh

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
d-dave, what up nigga?
matt jeezy <i>[laughs]</i>


<i>[chorus one: kendrick lamar]</i>
the homies say i'm the truest
the bitches think i'm the cutest

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
uh, i used to to wanna by like michael jordan
figured that i'd hit the nba and make a fortune
thank god for these rap recordings
i can ball like him on every verse and chorus
five-zero-ones, louis letterman jacket
little brother only five, momma put him on my taxes
you know that compton ghetto shit
that every section eight tenant is familiar with? ooh wee
they say he something like the seventies, but i'm from 'eighty-seven
with a thousand dimes, you got eighty sevens
gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
fucking all my high school teachers, that was 'five bro
and i don't like 'em if the ass thin
and i don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
the fuck i look like?
a billion bucks, and that's why

<i>[chorus two: kendrick lamar]</i>
the homies say i'm the truest
the bitches think i'm the cutest
the definition what cool is

bitch i do this
the definition what cool is

she looking at the car like she wanna fuck it

uh, so give me fifty feet champ

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
i was sitting on the couch, reading yellow paper
a letter in reply, seven days later
after i wrote him "stay strong, keep your faith in god"
what i told him, hoping that he's listening
said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
what a coincidence, i was bumping some plies
i can taste the salt from my tears
as the water had start to flood on my eyes
i know it gotta be hard being twenty-one
doing time in the pen and your gramp's old
your brother's getting older, and the streets is getting colder
and you're hoping that he's focussed to stay on the right road
sleeping in a cell, it's been thirty weeks
ain't received any mail, it's cold and the hole stinks
and you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
as i read every word that you write, i can only imagine
jason keaton, i can only imagine, yeah

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
sitting on the couch, that was my uncle bobby
after he just got out, fifteen years to count
haven't seen the world in so long, haven't seen a girl in so long
and before the sun came up, he was gone
like a fiend off the best rock
trying to get his life together, or whatnot
typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
found a job, found his mother gravesite, found a forty ounce
then he found god, then he bounced
then he found a new chick, two kids, wide hips
found something in her we didn't see
found this spot in pasadena and shacked with her, an investment
then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
violence on my uncle, was working with two strikes
only out a year, now facing life, i can only imagine
that's fucked up, i can only imagine, uncle bob

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
sitting on the couch, thinking bout the ratio
of blacks in prison, it's compact in prison
when blacks packed with minorities, system grab more of these
eighteen-year-olds, eighteen-year sentence
with no parole, the state won't oversee
they make the term severe, a conspiracy
that's what i call it, it's full of shit, a toilet can help quick
the government help? no, just put us on death row
just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
then hang it like right there, yeah, it's justice for all
but ninety-percent unfair, care? nah
alcatraz was purchased by a white man for five grand
with intentions to expand, more prisons
so these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
they for grossing a bigger business, imagine
we being used, imagine, the truth shall be told

<i>[chorus]</i>


<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
cloud nine, kendrick lamar, uh
i take a sip of hennessy and then get pissy drunk
i ain't a drinker, i'm a thinker, call it what you want
but if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
i found myself losing focus at a sunday service
embarrassed so i started questioning god, what is my purpose?
he say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
spread the word and witness, he rose on the first sunday
i said alright, enthused that my lord gave a listen
i opened my bible and searched to be a better christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
but shit, my life is so fucked up man, i can't help but give in
i'm giving testimonies to strangers i never met
hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how i was truly blessed
felt like i'm free from all my sins when the service was over
walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
single black parent from compton raising children of four
that's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know
her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
her baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit
spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
she pray to god every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
she thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the devil is a lie, make a better choice
and so it's back to mcdonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
then got a letter in the mail, lost her section eight
then lost her faith again

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[punch]</i>
kendrick, i appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
this about how faith works, yeah, murk it... 
i had dreams of holding a nine-milla to raise killa
ask him why as my eyes fill up
each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
it's jungle when the niggas ensue
the rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents
cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
i flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
it's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
it's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
i'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout
but it never rain in california 'less them pistols out
until then, my feet planted on the ground
shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
and if i get no answer, just know i tried
i should have never looked into his son's eyes
ray charles voice

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
this for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a god?
knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
but whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains
we can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
and your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares
searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
i watched people i know pray and catch the holy ghost
and wonder why i ain't never caught that feeling before
maybe they know him better, or i don't know no better
but what i do know is that he's real and he lives forever
so the next time you feel like your world's about to end
i hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

i'd rather not live like there isn't a god
than die and find out there really is, think about it


"boarding completed
i'd like to welcome you aboard flight number ftwobthree

but it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still

then step out like chicago in its finest era
you niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
downgrading yourself, you get an f for effort

i chose to keep to myself and let the world go
and if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
so she can be curious on twitter looking me up

ass so fat that it tipped over the aston

hello to my wittiness, i'm cadillac's grandson

gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
that's how i get at 'em when i look at a shoe rack
penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
so i can live on a hill just off a few raps
i want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
that might be outer space, the jupiter district
i quadruple my vision
if you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
i've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
on some compton shit
somebody that'll ride or die, that's a compton bitch
you see my city is the city of lamar
it'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
the swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
the tree for the low, don't you know, paul bunyan
i'm on cloud nine, i can see rain coming
so if i'm out my mind, people don't say nothing

<i>[chorus]</i>

"how was your flight mr. lamar?
good, hope to see you next time"


uh-uh-uh, what up?
uh, i'm tryna, what up?
uh-uh, i'm tryna get something
uh-uh-uh, i'm tryna, what up?
i say, what up?
uh-uh, i'm tryna

sometimes i wanna leave, sometimes i wanna cry
sometimes i hate to bear the truth, sometimes i wanna lie
sometimes i wanna school the youth, sometimes i wanna ride
sometimes i wanna not think, sometimes i wanna vibe
sometimes i wanna bump tribe and zone out, this song bout a young boy
that's going wild inside, when my world collide
with your world where your girl and your kids reside
we kill the facades, we feel free to fly
we're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
i care about my pride too much, if my clothes is new
if my ride is plush, if my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
i look in the mirror, i'm trendy enough? wrong
insecurity roams the black community
homes where kids must have jewelry
the high school female need earrings and details
so she can be cool to be amongst popularity
the various name brands that reach the price scan
that's not about the right price, but more like the right scam
to rule us all, confuse us all
hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain
in a range that is not paid for
my cousin from the south said he just bought him a house
that lives around his neck like a white collar
so why fast forward? then i rewind
a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
picking cotton from a field that a white man own
the blacker you are, farther you from the white man's home
negro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity
before your vanity they parted our families
they put us in hundred-degree shade, and outside we bathed
the more we were afraid, the more they made rules
and trapped our minds in the cage, our freedom was so fake
couldn't see it with the eyes of tracee ross, uh!
and school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
and a smirk could get you hurt, wound diversed from a scar
four-hundred years of nothing, four-hundred years of suffering
four-hundred years of tears and tribulation, miseducation
see what we facing is now coming, back to the roots
remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot?
call us niggers and figured that we'd never lived in pursuit
of happiness, we captured these feelings in things that we do
thought it's abstinence in slavery, but we made it come to
a modern perspective, my shoe selection gotta be louie
her handbag gotta be gucci, it's fake then she foobie
she still bad though, and her fake gucci ain't that bad though
we filling up the gas for rollies
upgrade to twenty-sixes, out there riding kobes
my cousin from the south, slavery start in the south and i bet ya
he overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
so blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw
the reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss
slaves

uh, i say the four-hundred years we never had nothing
barely had clothes on our back
it's the reason why when we get a little bit of change
we over-exaggerate on our living expenses
so if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
you're a vanity slave
if you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger
four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
you're a vanity slave
if you got an 'two monte carlo with twenty-fo's on it
and on the back of the window it says "get on my level hoe"
you're a vanity slave
we all vanity slaves
and with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
i'm not from around here
hey ali, where we at? idaho?
yeah nigga, you know the first of the month
you know them checks come in
i'm tryna get something, but what up?


<i>[kendrick lamar - singing]</i>
a nigga so goddamn stressed out
i feel like fuck everything right now
see i've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
but i'll be damned if i give 'em a handout
see my pride is one thing i will not put aside
i'm too proud to beg, i'm sorry left eye
if i don't make it in life, motherfucker i tried
what? uh

<i>[chorus one: kendrick lamar]</i>
you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
nobody, nobody but you
so it feels like, like it's only you

<i>[chorus two: kendrick lamar]</i>
so i'm feeling like i want to, i want to
i want to, i want to go so far from here
very, very far from here
i need to, i need to
i need to, i need to go so far from here
very, very far from here

<i>[kendrick lamar - singing]</i>
it seems like, you can't win for losing
whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
sitting pursuing, but your time will soon come
nobody knows the position that you in
but it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
that feeling, hard to explain
when you just, just want to get away
something like

<i>[chorus one]</i>

<i>[chorus two]</i>

<i>[schoolboy q]</i>
away from it all
take me out of hell where only heaven can visit
the smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
i'm stuck on the studio couch, now i'm thinking bout my daughter
times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
just press record or, seems like i need a mill' to keep my shit in order
instead of problem solving
from my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
as i fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
nothing is surrounding me, living my life
though it's better to write
configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
so how you feel? my nigga, i keep it real
a schoolboy soon to be star, mr. lamar

<i>[chorus two]</i>


<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
reporting live, from compton, california
north cackalack

now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
you're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
my itinerary is very hectic
i break records on every record, i'm truly reckless
kendrick lamar, know how to maul with my wrist
shout to writers for holding it down bitch
me and my down bitch, get busy
i'm busy taking over, the world
with the weight of the world on my shoulder
my drive is not to be chauffeured
i'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, i've done situated myself, i ain't lying
be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
the good kid from the mad city
holding a cereal box instead of a glock
in a one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two caddilac that i got from my pops
transmission slipping, but i ain't tripping, swallow my pride
pop in my tape and roll the window, down
like stacie homie when airing out endo
i wish a nigga would

<i>[rapper big pooh]</i>
yo, it's evident, i'm evidently your favorite
all i ask, open your ears and please savor it
the taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
i'm at a point in my life when i was getting tired
now i'm brushing off the dust
we don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
people hear his pain, i consider that a plus
i'm a grown man, so a few i have trust to do the right thing
the spike thing, consider me the in-between
the new regime taking over
either we each other's opposition or you soldier
used to have the whole state of nc on my shoulder then i passed it
off to the next, you unlucky bastard
i'm getting drunk same time every year
to celebrate the life, rosie no longer here
i swear

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
me and big pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
even zoos can beat up from punchlines
when i kick it and pump mine, i've got to be a prophet
i've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
i'm a hub city representer, so i've got to represent the
city like a district attorney being the case for killers
might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
since i had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers 

<i>[rapper big pooh]</i>
u-p-s, i (deliver)
little brown boy get the pick of the litter
no glitter, all guts, no glory
station on repeat, they retread the same story
new niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
have a plate, that food for your soul tip
drill it in your head, youngun it's that real hip-
hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped

<i>[chorus]</i>


we on ali? you ugly
everybody just clap your hands if you're real
middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
be yourself, just show me you're real
middle fingers up

<i>[chorus]</i>
just let me be me, hmm
that's the only way i know
just let me be me, hmm
that's the only way i know
(that's the only way i know how to hold it down
that's-that's the only way i know how to hold it down)

uh, i just wanna be me
no disrespect, but motherfuck you
my education stopped at a high school degree
but i can outsmart any high iq
draped in some fly shit, call me jeff goldblum
cold, my style making my nose run
oh, i stare at the mirror, then realize
that real lies, within me
some say i'm crazy cause i think like i need a shrink
ask too many questions about the stars and earth shit
rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
so if i'm not clubbing, don't think i'm on some jerk shit
and california on that jerk shit
but i'd just rather two-step like my first steps
jill scott in my ipod as my head rests, yes

<i>[chorus]</i>

and yeah i know i'm from compton, cali'
but i don't lace up chucks or rock tan khakis
and skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
i probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
ha-ha-ha, i like to joke, got a sense of humor?
stale face, play me short like an oompa-loompa
you ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
won't you lighten up like michael did?
i grew up with killers man, people who killed man
but my character never could be like them man
and they respect that, say that i'm real man
not a fake person, that's the sims man
live my life through some film man?
i ain't acting out shit, i be packing out shows
cause they know they'll know kendrick fo' sho', and oh

<i>[chorus]</i>

almost lost my life to the industry
had to look through a photo book to remember me
these label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
have you with professional killers, chasing hits
lying to yourself all over an image
making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
my mama said, boy that don't sound like you
i said, this is the sound though, my only excuse
quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
and kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
the reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
and you can underrate me, but i know what i'm worth
a diamond in god's dirt, a diamond in winter
watching simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
see i give you my life to mix it up in a blender
to make sure that you feel it

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[uncredited female]</i>
kendrick lamar, what are you trying to say?
what are you trying to accomplish kendrick lamar?
kendrick lamar, what are you trying to say?
what are you trying to accomplish kendrick lamar?
is this really you? is this who you are?
what are you trying to say?
what are you trying to accomplish kendrick lamar?
who are you?
what are you trying to accomplish kendrick lamar?
kendrick lamar, what are you trying to say?
what are you trying to accomplish kendrick lamar?

i think that i finally reached the pinnacle
of finding myself as an individual
the world is so typical
i just wanna be higher than that
i used to want to be the messiah of rap
infatuated with becoming a relevant star
trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
that i never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
vanity, they say that it can damage me
so do i really want it?
if i didn't, i guess i'm a cool cocaine connect
that means i'll be fronting, hmm
cooking in a laboratory, hoping i can tell a story
that the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
knowing that i'm misunderstood
so i gotta get my point across like a snitch would
and i would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
and dame said he proud of my newfound honesty
and all i could say is, will the radio care?
yeah, or should i say no?
or should i just stop and come with a whole new approach?
you heard my hip hop when i was sixteen years old
well that was me then, now i'm an adult
twenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know, most determined
but with the smallest of funds to show, but i'm not worried
my talent should take me places i've never been
the world should turn soon as my record spin
i wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
the negative you bring, the stress, the violence
the capital punishment, the loud police sirens
too focussed, one word, righteous
and this is kendrick lamar
and soon y'all know cloud nine y'all
and that means i wanna be the highest
too focussed, one word (righteous)
mm, yeah
that means i wanna be the highest
too focussed, one word

<i>[uncredited female]</i>
too focussed, too focussed, one word
too focussed, too focussed, one word
too focussed, too focussed, one word
too focussed, one word
too focussed, too focussed, one word


<i>[intro: napoleon hill]</i>
"i want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible
because it will reveal to you why it is true
that whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve
regardless of how many times you have failed in the past
or how lofty your aims and hopes may be"

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
go getter, with no cheddar
just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
my life is likely to see great endeavors
but i can't win if i can't get it together
what i gotta do in order to see success?
having the world's best to call me the best
pull up at the grammy awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
a dollar and a dream, i feel j. cole
word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
that don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
but the last i checked, y'all was broke bitches
make a name for myself
then bubble like the ass of buffy when she wearing a tight belt
the homies on the block can say whatever they say
i don't wanna be a killer, i wanna be a gates

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
what i gotta do in order to see success?
having the world's best to call me the best
pull up at the grammy awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
do i gotta run in your spot and blasting?
better yet, rob the nearest nix check cashing
hear a hustle from a nigga that's constantly bragging
catch him at the light, snatch him out his jeep wagon
or maybe i gotta hook up with jose
cop five bricks of the yay, head to the bay
area, or carry the birds to the gate
let the clips distribute the work all day
then come back home
every three weeks, flip three-to-six zones
homies on the block can say whatever they want
i don't wanna be a dealer, i wanna be a trump
donald that is

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar - over chorus]</i>
and when i do it, i do it again, then i go back
when i do it, i'll do it again, then i go back
thug it out, but for now i'm willing to dug it out
i gotta grind, grind

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
so welcome to the story of my life
see i'm tryna get right off the shit that i write
make a fortune, buy some porsches for my momma and the wife
pop's engine in this old school run tight!
but as you listening to k. d-o-t
me and my girl split the bucket at kfc
she listening to drake and all i can say
damn, these niggas that much better than me?
baby, i don't think this is meant to be
cause i'm always losing self-esteem
she paused the iphone, then said huh
i repeated what i said, then she replied shut up
you know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
but don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
and never listen to what the industry say
don't be a typical artist, be more like jay
russell, barry gordy, quincy jones
bob johnson, sean combs, l.a. reid
young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
so i gotta see success
i gotta make it off them rosecrans steps
rising to the top like a soda shook up
bout to pop, and i'll pop on whoever's in my way

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar - over chorus]</i>
yeah, i swear to god i don't wanna do it, just live man
i wanna live good
just wanna make my momma proud, y'know?
i don't wanna be hard, i don't want the most stripes
i got lil' brothers and sisters man, i'm the oldest nigga
i just want it, i just want it
and i'ma get it


<i>[intro: excerpt from interview with dash snow]</i>
i'll tell you what i don't believe in, can i do that?
alright, i don't believe in the, in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever
i try not to obey them at any time
that's what i believe in, not believing in
(so what keeps you alive?)
four big bottles of water a day, two packs of marlboro reds and
uh, what keeps me alive? shit, um
music, i have to listen to music all day long
i say that keeps me going
i'm a pretty dark person, i've thought about ending it a million times
and i have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
thank you
sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
and still i come up clever, i just need to free my thoughts
and lord knows that i know better, but i ain't perfect
i ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
you should either hear me now or go deaf
or end up dead, die trying and know death
might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect nigga
i mean that from the bottom of my heart
you see my art is all i have, and victory tastes sweet
even when the enemy can throw salt
still knock 'em out the park like a fucking tow car
let bygones be bygones, but where i'm from
we buy guns and more guns to give to the young
i'm living the life of a nigga trapped nigga
inside the system, all you envision is trap niggas
my uncle doing life inside prison, he wasn't wrapped too tight
he told me rap about life, not rap, niggas
that's why i'm shaking my head when you rap dissing
my stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
i start evaluating, then my final intuition
is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
we used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
and this is compton, lions in the land of the triumph
wrap saran our defiance, ban our alliance
put burners in the hands of the black man
one hood with twenty fo'-fo's like a cloned kobe bryant
you probably heard i wanna be heard and wonder who i am
you probably even listen to "faith" and think i know zion
but really i'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth
because it seem like it's always clashing with science
i got a big fear of flying
my future so bright i'd probably go blind before i blink twice, i ain't lying
i swear to god half of y'all just don't know kendrick
the school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
you walking down the block, he got shot, you wouldn't know i witnessed
you just mind your bidness
you just turn your head, kneel down, and then tie your tennises
it's kinda scary ain't it
you can't act like no bitch, that only got tyler perry famous
just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless?
cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you when you hated him
so much, you probably had your burner tucked in graduation
said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him, facing
twenty-five to life with a murder charge
your enemies was the prey, and now you pray to god
i pray these bars get farther than compton
and if my record never break i still won't break my promise, i promise to keep it honest
secret society, all we ask is trust
and all we lack is communication like service sucks
the people scared of annihilation when kingdom come
and i'm like, the kendrick lamar o.d. in less than a month
alright? gotta keep it pushing
can't let the government tell me how my future looking
i'm on rosecrans &amp; central trying to duck the central bookings
if the fucking pigs get behind me then you know i'm bucking, never will i surrender
i've been a warrior when i came out of my mom's placenta
in the gutter lane like i'm master splinter
how splendid, i guess my project had did it
got all these niggas approaching their mixtapes different
they said seven tracks, i said fifteen
called it an ep, they said i'm tripping
but little did they know, i'm tryna change the rules
that we've been confined to, so the corporate won't make decisions
uppity bitches, handling bidness
killing our dreams, stealing our vision
out in haiti adolescents barely have a home
in l.a. everybody think they fucking on
hop on twitter, perpetrate, we doing big shit
who we hanging with, and bragging about the iphone
i swear to god, most y'all cats just don't know kendrick
you barely know yourself, so i guess most of y'all should be offended
ain't doing this for my health, i'm just trying to purchase my momma them businesses
occupy my time with riches, justify my time, ambition's
just to coincide, just to go inside, books we idolize while we living
look the mastermind, took the master's mind, just the perfect time, just to mastermind
just to master grind with precision, look the mastermind, took the... <i>[coughs]</i>

<i>[outro]</i>
we would like to call this an appreciation tape
for those who recognized the kendrick lamar ep
for this is the kendrick lamar o.d.
because of you, we are overly dedicated


<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
that's what she said to me
that place i used to call home is just a bed to me
and we don't even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
meanwhile i'm in these streets with everybody
i'm trying to get it and she know they got me, i watch her feelings watch me
as they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
look each other in the face and barely blink
i tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
so if my letters don't reach you, i hope these lyrics in sync

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
that's what it said to me
but that place i call ambition now dead to me
gone and forgotten, i'm off track like dale earnhardt
my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
club night, guys and dolls
balling out, but i'm bout to drop the ball
i'm calling out for help, my engineer called
told me come to the studio, i wanna tell him nah

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
that's what he said to me
but that place we call heaven unfair to me
only a hundred and forty-four can go
seven billion people on planet earth today
is there something that i don't know?
i know to follow him, rather following people
or follow vanity cause that means i'm following evil
guess i'm following evil, i should follow cathedral
blessings i need, but live like i don't need you

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
so in conclusion
we all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
so to what's important in my life, i apologize
i promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
we all get distracted
the question is, would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
would you not know how to act or take action? it's just a part of life
and if your vision's impaired, you probably lose it all tonight

<i>[jhene aiko]</i>
i'm trying to visualize how to get it right
but my vision's so blurry
trying to slow it down, stay close to the ground
but we're always in a hurry now
and if i could make this world stand a little slower
then i would, then we could grow a little closer
i think we're getting closer
i think we're getting closer


i remember, uh
all my uncles, sir smokers
on the landra, in front of our building
they was my heroes

<i>[chorus]</i>
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crackheads
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead

uh, and that's scary to me
dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
especially when sounwave is on his ps
nigga cue me in, i'm a peruvian drug lord
don't fast forward, i'ma serve you some +keys+
this is crack cocaine, i'm kurt cobain
and i bang like a c-r-i-p
p-r-i-u, high you, i'm an i-v
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crack... stop
i said an i-v cause when i be
in the studio, high shot, a needle in your vein
take it in vain or itch till your eyeballs pop
i'm cold on the cold turkey, i hate chickens
but i do fuck pretty birdies, where your girl at?
over the pyrex where my world at

<i>[chorus]</i>

uh, and that's scary to me
every listener is a strawberry to me
you pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
disease on k-dot? uh uh, better wake up
a nightmare, i'm right there like a siamese
twin, when you motherfuckers gon' learn?
curl up like big worm when i drop
who fly? i'm a red eye with eyedrops
i big, i 'pac, you chris, i +rock+
that's pookie hom', new jack head-first with a cyclops
i'm the first one to do that, i bet you never knew that
back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
if it ain't about me, about hoe
or be about face if you ain't no higher, learn it
there's soda in the pot and the fire, burning

<i>[chorus]</i>

uh, and it's scary to carry
a smooth-type flow like a drink of merlot
that'll freak y'all out like a girl virgo
when i turbo on any track it's a reynolds wrap
and i rap like a nigga who invented rap, rapping heat
you could fall to defeat if you don't pay your tolls
like the limbs on your feet, i suppose
this is bigger than life
this is probably everybody illuminatis
guess i'm the blood sacrifice
of the party, i undress her like a harley
lights will flash, cars will crash
smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
so my bad if i put you in rehab
you are reimbursed, put it on my, tab

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar - over chorus]</i>
aw dude, you about to fucking o.d. bro

("hey what's up daddy?")

pussy and patron make you feel alright
pussy and patron, that's some great advice

"so what'd you rush me out here for?
how was your day? are you tipsy?"
"mhm!"

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i> 
all i need in this lifetime: pussy and patron
give me that, once you give me that, once again it's on
bitch i'm swagged up, hoes bopping when i'm off that screw
coming down clean, tell your baby momma what it do?
where your friends at? i got long dick, what it is?
go on poke it out, situate your little positives
how i live? big shot, on my grind, all ready
i'mma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me...

give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
i can't get enough, if i offend you, blame it on the liquor babe
give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
i can't get enough if i offend you...

uh, i wrote this song when dave drove home
and caught that flat, in the mean t flats
and it made me think if we could blink
to change locations where we at
we often get lost in the alcohol bottle
in attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
your car note due and you 'bout to get evicted
two drugs surely, patron, pussy, make it feel alright
but once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life
you can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
the antidote wouldn't last and you knew it, nigga
but still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign

i'm going through something with life
but pussy and patron make you feel alright
pussy and patron make you feel alright
pussy and patron, that's some great advice
i'm going through something with life
but pussy and patron make you feel alright
pussy and patron make you feel alright
pussy and patron, that's some great advice

<i>[ab-soul:]</i>
okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should i begin?
finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
crackers watch my every step, man i hate to work for them
one time i tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me
and here i am, stressing, questioning my direction man
what to do? nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
(soul!) balls deep, ya dig? retrieve, relief, ya dig?
let's kill a bottle of tequila
and lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?
what's up? i had a long day and i really wanna fuck
take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day
'cause all i've been thinking the whole day...

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
i'm going through something with life
but pussy and patron make you feel alright
pussy and patron make you feel alright
pussy and patron, that's some great advice
i'm going through something with life
but pussy and patron make you feel alright

<i>[chorus]</i>
she look better than beyonce, alicia keys, halle berry, miss jolie
where's she from? no i.d., that girl's an alien
and if i die before i wake, i pray that i'm in outer space
u-f-o fly away
so let's go-go-go-go, let's go-go-go-go
let's go-go-go-go, let's go, let's go

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
uh, she got me going, i'm all in
fifty stories, i'm falling
where you been? is it planet mars?
far beyond the stars? are you a martian?
you're unfamiliar, but still i feel ya
energy is sending me toward the ceiling
i'm high now, are you up there?
if you was, i would climb every other stair
i gotta stare, i mean wow
and i'm wowed, no one compares
a one-on-one, you must have won
every pageant in america when you was young
lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy, insane, crazy
the only girl that can make time, then make me stop

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
uh, so now we on, so now we gone
living in the city of the unknown
i show her off, i stunt with her
we do it sweet, they look bitter
look at her get up, i hear 'em say
but why him? i hear 'em hate
i laugh at it, rather than jab at it
then continue eternal life as a crack addict
cause i'm addicted, and you the drug
cold turkey? no sir
gotta be an odyssey from heaven way above
you definite, not probably, i gotta give it up
lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy, insane, crazy
the only girl that can make time, then make me stop

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
you something different
i'm glad i found you
so pretty
i'll never do anything to hurt you


<i>[female crying]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
uh, yeah <i>[threex]</i>
uh
we hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people...
i'm inspired, so get inspired

and so he said, why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
why you couldn't be a con-artist? why you couldn't
why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
the moment that we first started?
why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
why you let me use yours cause i don't got mines?
why you always lift me up when i'm completely giving up?
or when niggas holler what's up, you give a dry response?
why you giving me your last, knowing you ain't got it?
why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
why you tell me that you love me? why you always thinking of me?
want my company rather than going club hopping
why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
why you making promises that you'll forever do?
whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
these are exactly the reasons why i cheat on you, sometimes

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
and so she said, why you gotta be so mean to me?
why you don't know what you mean to me?
why you always playing games? why i feel like you ashamed
out in public, curse me out and make a scenery?
why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
why text messages popping up saying hi daddy?
why you treat me like i'm nothing? why you always at a function?
i be wanting to go out but you don't never ask me
why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
why you always assuming that i still love my ex?
every time we get into it, i'm the one that's feeling stupid
you don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's your favorite threat
why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
why i feel i'm the last option after your homies?
why you always gotta know that i will never let you go
even though you get violent and put your hands on me? sometimes

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[outro: lamont carey "she says she loves me"]</i>
she says she loves me, she says she loves me
so she clings to me even when i want to be left alone
but she's beautiful
like sometimes when i have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
and she only gives advice, she says when i give her a cue
she says she loves me
like when i wake up in the morning
she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
she says she needs me, she says she loves me
or like when i'm stepping out of the shower
she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
she says, she says she loves me
so instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
she says, she says she loves me
and i don't know about love


<i>[female]</i>
i used to want to be like michael jordan
figured i would hit the nba and make me a fortune

<i>[chorus one: kendrick lamar]</i>
uh, every time i'm in my city i be hacking like my shit don't stink

and i don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
i'm a comp-town representer, concrete backflipper
a.k.a. that nigga, don't worry
i don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and i don't know why you fuck niggas can't see

you jocking her, let her be a hoe, why you stopping though?
we stopping the traffic, what you know bout them hockey pucks?

see too many of y'all getting money, know my turn coming
i don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and i don't know why... "hey, wait a minute motherfucker"

<i>[chorus two: kendrick lamar]</i>
every time i'm in my city i be feeling like my shit don't stink

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>

<i>[chorus two]</i>

<i>[schoolboy q]</i>

my paper long, yep you left alone, you gets none fucks
leaning off the actavis, passing blunts round and round
told mary/merry was a (go), so we passed her (round) and (round)
your bitch texted me, wants it now, so i had to knock her down
work her bouncing on my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
you let it slide, i hit home-runs, clean her dugout till i'm done
i can be her number two and you can be her number one
her pussy's crazy, her pussy's crazy

<i>[chorus two]</i>


lord forgive me

<i>[verse one:]</i>
kill him where he stand or stand over him shake his hand
then jump back in that mini van, double back to his block
and blam i ain't backing down for nothing
i'm a back em down like shaq with this black two-two-three in my hand
better pray that this chopper jam, like a radio single, man
police radio signals sayin' that a one hundred and eighty-seven land on your corner,
coroners comfort your mama, mama he's dead,
the next morning high toasted up with my homies
we drink and smoke marijuana, want us to change our ways? uh-huh
you see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in compton
ask me what i have accomplished
i don't know i don't have conscience
i just load up and start dumpin' on enemies i'm head hunting
no sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets just get something
protect ya neck cause they comin' for set respects split your onion
then chop your deck your head tumblin' like gymnastics
cause ignorance is bliss

<i>[verse two:]</i>
this the hardest shit you've heard from la this far
and i'm this far, from a discharge but never will i dish off
we all tryna ball and when i got the rock i'll dish off
until the day i pistol whip you posers till ya'll pissed off
then peel off, in a hooptie
come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
and they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
indubitably i'm too street
indubitably i'm a do me
better than your bitch would
but you niggas too weak, but just give me two weeks
and i'm good
i'll make an album that'll put a smile on malcolm
make martin luther tell god i'm the future for heaven's talent
no tarot card reading i'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
not only from the rap game, i'm including the planet
cats so watered down clowns can sink titanic
tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic
give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
die young, corpse identified by your parents
apparently you a parrot
mocking me and my blueprint
but i won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff
stop it, i'm hearin' the comments
the critics are calling me conscious
but truthfully, every shooter be callin' me compton
so truthfully, only calling me kweli and common?
proves, that ignorance is bliss

<i>[verse three:]</i>
and this still the hardest shit you've heard from la this far
and i'm this far, from a discharge but never will i dish off
this my world, i grab the universe then play kickball
and they wonder why these california earthquakes hit so hard
i'm so-cal, you so called
rappers need to go call
ghostbusters to shoot busters i'm casper when i go off
i show up, to show out to show off
you a hundred percent behind me
and if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene
i remember being seventeen wishing someone would sign me
now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
backin' down boggins
backin' down bitches
we gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin
you gon' tip her
cause ignorance is bliss
and willy b i'm a fool on yo beats, i bleed out the speaker
as the speaker that spoke when they done speak


<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
this is me thinking at four:forty-three am, june six

sometimes i wanna say fuck rapping, i need money now
like should i start trapping? if what i write down
don't connect this very moment, then i'm on it, no question
in the streets my niggas is well connected, let's see
do i cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some e?
oxycontin have laying on soft cotton when i sleep?
this is deep as the abyss, i'm not just rhyming on the beat
i be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
this is me frustrated, battling my own evils
finna saddle up that work, across ohio in a geo
or should i sell my music .zip to buy your zip
and hope one day it flourish to a kilo, track record of a hustler
rather records on the needle, making music
clocking fast bank like a shot from patrick ewing
my nigga, what you doing on these corners with me?
"i thought you had a show?" well i guess my nigga, i didn't
i'm tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting
especially when your homies pushing veight hinges
twenty-two on twenty-sixes, range rovers rolling up
three-fifty for an ounce of fire, i hope i got enough
this industry calling my bluff, i need a new solution
curve-serving, know i might be in your store boosting
two-elevens with mac-elevens like fuck hip hop
don't wanna be pun, don't wanna be b.i.g., don't wanna be 'pac
just give me your funds, a.k.a. everything that you got
or everything getting shot, for nothing
leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
then expand to the hoover dam, water
sherm, contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
i disperse to the world of unruly, where i put the mic down
and pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
you'll know i always had a passion for riddle when writing
but lately i've been thinking bout taking chances to brighten
my future financially, so please don't be mad at me
i gotta do what i gotta do, no shit
so i tell my nigga front me, let me put it on the strip
then give it back when i think about the consequence, shit

<i>[bj the chicago kid]</i>
there are times, when you need someone
i will be by your side
oh darling, cause there is a light that shines
special for you, and me yeah
i-take-i-take-take my chances-chances-chances
before they pass, they pass, they pass
pass me by, oh darling
you've got to look at the other side

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
r.o.t.c., or right on time conscience


<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
one time
reporting live, compton, california

have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
like you never get right? sort of like a black sheep
back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
chasing for the win but you never win the track meet
oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
and life's a bitch, don't hit women so i bit her
i struck enough pain, let her know i wasn't playing
i was so (sincere) like nas' first name
and back, they'd tell me, it's very difficult to see twenty-five
and if i survive i probably wouldn't sell it
my opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
in the ghetto, rather in some heals like giuseppe's
they want me unemployed, until i hit the streets
for filling voids of broke d-boys selling weed
fucking up my prestige, till i live with the blues
b.b. king or the neighbors of snoop

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
like you never did right? sort of like a black sheep
tryna get away from the world stereotype
barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny
she desperately in need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
she gon' have a baby, then flee from her education
at the age of sixteen, credit card scam schemes
see a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
she will never get by, no how, no way
welfare recipient, property of the state
housing, section eight, corner store, prostitute
the owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she cute
hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
and this baby daddy is new to the family
chilling in pajamies, waiting on the first
fast-forward, spilling drinks on her fur

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
have you ever felt like you finally got life?
you finally got right? no longer a black sheep
living off your (dreams) like christina uh-milian in the front seat
of a convertible, eloping to get married
what a feeling of overcoming the odds
it's like you just hit the lottery, my god
there must be a god, cause golly
you done made it through the fight while squabbling, ali
now your lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cops
and you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
and she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
making good decisions, got an independent business mind
and both of y'all are steady grinding, doing it the legal way
just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
but they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
you must have joined the illuminati just to ball out

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
just laugh, then everybody say

<i>[ash riser]</i>
cause i won't get caught again
and i'm here to start the trend
you can't catch me if you try
disappear into the night, and i'm gone

<i>[outro]</i>
"so you made it past all the barbed wires?"
just one more left <i>[gun shot]</i>


the hardest thing for me to do
is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
that's the hardest thing

who is k. dot? a young nigga from compton
on the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
on the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
the fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
everyone i knew was either crip or piru
cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
with that being said, each one of their rivals
was aiming something at my head, i needed survival
got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
and i don't even push a line, i'm just tryna push these rhymes
in the midst of staying neutral and discrete
my momma said you're judged by the company you keep
but what you can consider, that if it goes down
they'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
so if you ask what i'm doing
i'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and,.. real talk, and

i was walking from centennial
when an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and i was like hold up
where you from? "how-bang"
where you stay? "westside", that's a piru gang to be exact
well aware they had blue across they hat
dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
shots rang out, hoping to god i wasn't wet
crossed to cross rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five, they said they already knew
what happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
never seen that many guns in my life
i was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
you my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
thought about that so long i had failed my finals, fuck, but

i don't do black music, i don't do white music
i do everyday life music
give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
you say you through, but i've been through it, now that's cold
and this is for my county building children
in hub city on hubcaps, no power-steering
i use perseverance in this mad city
where the niggas drink remy and hold semis for cutthroats
bernie mac died, it's no joke
don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but i'm high off life
i could fall out the sky like twice
and land in the land of the aks
and the minivans where the fan never on
cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
in other words, we get it cracking, but i keep it cool, y'know?

so there you have it
but i'm a leave you with this
an og once told me
a real gangster is either dead or in jail
or behind the scenes getting real money
i'm gone


h.o.c., h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.
h.o.c., h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.
h.o.c.

everybody know i spit that hunk of shit
shit that make you duck for cover shit
shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
especially when drop drop the beat
i drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
jump in the booth, then shatter every rapper's dream
they jump in a sauna because i killed their self-esteem
that's a jab, you should bob and weave
like pam when martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
i go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
cause i'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
you telling me the kush make you think on level four?
i'm on five, you saying i can level more?
in high school, my teachers thought i was smoking stress
didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
i stimulate my mind every time i think about the end of time
creation of man and columbine

<i>[chorus]</i>
bet you think that this some high shit that i wrote
probably think i'm off the kush or the hydro
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i really appreciate that you share your endo
but a sip of henny is the farthest i would go
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke

look, nowadays everybody think they big chiefers
just cause they heard that new tape from wiz khalifa
knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
they new booties, they probably need baby powder
my skill shower over your city for forty days
forty nights, off the chain like freedom of slaves
before you get it twisted like forty gays
my flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
those the type of lines that i'm talking bout
you know, the type of rhymes you don't talk about
copy my session on a disc when the session ends
so my mama can have it and play it for her friends
brag on me like my son's bout to win
somehow, someday, and i don't care when
i might hit the gin once a month
i'll let you inhale/in hell, like an atheist

<i>[chorus]</i>

uhh, i'll take you back to the ninth grade
when dough boy had me high for four days
that's my nigga, he a street nigga
probably in your hood fucking up your street nigga
but anyway, i think it was some purple
told me don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you
i didn't listen, i was floating like the rose parade
swear to god a nigga seen some flying fishes
that was the vegas trip hooters sponsored
the same time i start writing like a fucking monster
i'm frankenstein every time this motherfucker ponders
just underline every letter
capital k-d-o-t, letting it flat out
like a tire with slow leaks, and what you bout?
nothing huh? am i square cause i don't puff a square?
are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? yeah

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar (screwed)]</i>
h.o.c., h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c. (bitch i'm blowed!)
h.o.c., h.o.c. (bitch i'm blowed!)
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.
all the real smokers give me h.o.c.


uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh, uh
ali, you thirsty on twitter <i>[laughs]</i>
you boo-boo, you t
you turned down, you thirsty
you boo-boo

uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna find myself, i'm searching deep for kendrick lamar
i read about napoleon hill and try to know god
they say he the key to my blessings
and if i speak the good into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
money flow like water, i'll just wait at the dock
and by the way i'ma start, finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
i'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
but i notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
always hollering who she don't like, and who she kick it with
who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
who dooney &amp; bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
to the car she drove last year, or who fucking on who
and who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
but before your negative energy curve, bitch, i'ma cut you off

<i>[chorus]</i>
cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
he say, she say, oh my god
shut the fuck up... hoe
every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
he say, she say

uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
or at least inquire similar desires
to do what it t-a-k-e just to reach the t-o-p
i'm talking ideas, motivation
it's more than making enemies my nigga
oh, that's not your memo? then tell me why you constant stressing
on how much you well connected like centipedes my nigga?
i function with you and you flaunt your pistol
every second tell me how you pressed him at the monte crystal
where so-and-so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
that shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
speak on something with some substance that can get us both paid
rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, i'ma cut you off

<i>[chorus]</i>
cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah

every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
he say, she say

uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
i'm tryna feel the vibe of mona lisa, studying art
now paint that picture, life behind bars
remember the very day i got caught?
i murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
see what i was taught, family is all i need
but indeed, them too can run me right up a tree
constantly talking shit bout the next relative
wanting me to take sides, but i'd never give in
ever since grandma died everyone parted ways
argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
for fifteen years no one paid, him attention but moms
yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come
come to my house just to yap about your own people, dang
and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
i would probably cut y'all off, too, yep

<i>[chorus]</i>
cause every time you come around y'all be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
he say, she say, oh my god
shut the fuck up... keep it running ali
every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
he say, she say

so tell 'em shut the fuck up

<i>[outro:]</i>
what is hiiipower?
hiiipower is the way we think, the way we live
see it's known today that the human race is nothing
no moral, no standards
what we're about to do is raise the level of expectations
no you don't have to have a lot of money
you don't have to be rich
but you will be rich in mind and spirit
some say it's as big as a crew, some say it's as big as a gang
hiiipower, we stand for it as if it's as big as a religion


"my nigga, what it look like?"

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying
bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
genosism, criticism, unemployment, racism
burning buildings, aids victims, cancer killing, no cure
oil spilling, turmoil, poverty-stricken
police brutality kicking ass of us africans, hostages in afghanistan
not to mention another prison, child molesting
cow intestines, botox injection, earthquakes that's government testing
secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
that turn to crack, then invest it amongst us blacks, just a method
to hold us back, great depression, amongst iraq no direction
no google map, just a tec for the soowoo
swerving isuzu, then blah-blah-blah, adolescents go cuckoo
mothers are boo-boo crying, the governor keep us starving
these commercials keep us buying these cigarettes
supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph, distinctive living with science
no place to live in, no zion, see that's forbidden, we frying

"my nigga, what it look like?"
that's exactly what hell look like, uh

i was your highness, you was my queen
you got over him when i got in between
watching martin on tv as it was t-d-s
for us to eat tv dinners every time we was famished
but it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
every time i put the head in you would panic
and come right down like an avalanche
make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
baby how that sound? kosher, no sir
wake it back up, folgers posters
by my waistline, shout for your hard hit
you called it a hate crime, say you want me back
and your girl wanna date dom, that's high school shit
four-zero-one k, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[murs]</i>
i upped and walked out, now she crying cuz
she need me, i got that john bryan love
had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
we was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
you know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
my heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
there we go again, what the fuck you talking bout?
we used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
smoking beedies, laying on the futon
memories i got saved up like a coupon
and we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
i was broke then, couldn't count the best weed
then she would just leave in a black hatchback
homies from the hood used to ask me if i'd tapped that
i would say yep, smiling so freely
that was back then, but i bet she still need me
she need me, she need me
she need me, she need me
i would say yes, smiling so freely
that was back then, i bet she still need me

concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
i stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
her complexion in a direction i've outgrown
damn girl, why so much?
you bout to blow your cover when you cover up
don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
from heaven is where you got it from
i love your smile, you can do it without style
from your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
it's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
i don't see it, all i see is a blur

lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
not a cloud in sight, just the shit that i write
strong enough to stand in front of a traveling freight train
are you trained, to go against dracula?
dragging the record industry by my fangs
ak clips, money clips and gold chains
you walk around with a p-ninety like it's the ninetys
bullet to your temple, you're homicidal, remind me, that

up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it
i'm driving on e with no license or registration
heart racing, racing past johnny because he's racist
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, the children on ronald reagan
raked the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch
(i'm really out here nigga) you blowing on stress hoping to ease the stress
(like, really out here) he copping some blow, hoping that he can stretch
newborn massacre, hopping out the passenger
with calendars, cause your day coming
run him down and then he gun him down, i'm hoping that you fast enough
even the legs of michael johnson don't mean nothing, because

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
i used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary
thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
since my uncles was institutionalised
my intuition has said i was suited for family ties
my mama is stressing, my daddy tired
i need me a weapon, these niggas ride
every minute, hour and second, ministers tried
to save me, how i'm gon' listen when i don't even hear god?
heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
my hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink
you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
that same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
i deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun
and you'll be looking in my eyes homie
stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
but anyway, this for my niggas
uncles, twenty-three hours sending me pictures
i want you to know that i'm so determined to blow
that you hear the music i wrote, hope it get you off death row
you came home to a pocket full of stones
a metropc' phone, then you went back in
so when i touch the pen, the pen is in my view
i'ma get it right just so you

<i>[glc]</i>
and i do this for the city
got some hennessy and my real niggas with me
fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
if it feel good to ya, holler if you hear me

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
that same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
i'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
i'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
not rich but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
my killings are not remorseful, the city got my back
before that, i give them my torso
you think about it, and don't call me lyrical
cause really i'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
i know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
my simplest shit be more pivotal
i penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
worry some individuals that live life critical
so won't you bare witness while i bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
but anyway, this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
on "wanna be heard" probably thought he worked my nerves
but really he was stressing me, getting what i deserved
somebody said my name on the radio, he ain't know
i was ready for the world that minute
so the next time he roll up and drop grams in it, he'll probably be
out of work, laid back, while he

<i>[glc]</i>
and i do this for the city
got some hennessy and my real niggas with me
fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
if it feel good to ya, holler if you hear me

church is definitely on the move, you know what i'm talking bout?

babies from eightys don't know no better
don't nothing go better with ignorance
but the belligerent kids that we living with
some of them masculine, some of the feminine
'member the universe used to be innocent
now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
everyday that i wake up, i'ma sin again
i'm not a citizen
i'm just a nigga from section.eighty

show of hands, how many been taking notes?
good
leave everything on the table now
on the real
this is your generation
show, show your pain


<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
uh, and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
she takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
she play mr. shakur, that's her favorite rapper
bumping "brenda's got a baby" while a pervert yelling at her
and she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
the seven cars start honking, she start running
like flo-jo, don't care if they joe blow
if they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
and sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
just give all to her daddy, but she don't know her father, that's ironic
see a block away from lueders park, i seen the el camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
rosa parks never a factor when she making ends meet

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
her anatomy is god's temple
and it's quite simple, her castle is bout to be destroyed
she's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
undercovers and dummies that look like decoys
remember sergeant let her slide
said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
his eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
it was a block away from lueders park, i seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
cause rosa parks never a factor when she topping off police

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
as she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
of the black man, white man, needing satisfaction
at first it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinners' redemption
that sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
this motherfucker is the fucking reason why keisha rushing
through that block away from lueders park, i seen the el camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
then caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street
keisha's song

mm, my little sister eleven, i looked her right in the face
the day that i wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play

got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson with madness
now just imagine the magic i light to asses
don't ask for your favorite rapper

(he dead) yessir

(he dead) i killed him
(amen) bitch

and this is rigamortis
and it's gorgeous when you die
ali recorded and i'm morpheus,
the matrix in my mind
i'm out the orbit
you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
i'm on the toilet when i rhyme
if you the shit then i decline
i climax when you begin
and then i end on cloud nine
and that's important when you morph
into an angel in the sky
and don't be forging all my signatures
my listeners reply and tell me
that you biting style
you got a hell of an appetite
and i'm be here for a while
just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you could fight
we always making them duck or die
a suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
csi, just might investigate
this fucking parasite

this is studio felony
pharrell got me too many
and cool enough for the seventys
nigga, payback's a bitch
and bitch you been living in debt with me

leave a call on his mother voicemail
to say that he rest in peace

i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

i rapped him and made him casper
i captured the likes of nasa
my pedigree to fly past ya
i pass the weed to the pastor
we all are sinners,
won't you send us to bible study faster
you hypocrit-esque is reaction of blasphemy
i assassin my casualty
and it's casually done
and tell 'em my salary come
a lump sum of hundreds
don't talk to be bout no money
the sun is under my feet
and i come in peace to compete
i don't run if you rather leap
my statistics go up in weeks
and i go visit the nearest creek
and i get busy on many mc
really ballistic, anybody can see
any assistance, everybody done see
some persistence, recognize i be
really too vicious, the permanent beast
and the demolition, breaking up the streets
better partition, better dot your t
and i gon' mention, how the far you see
putting my dick in the rap industry
everybody bitchin', getting mad at me
recognize kendrick, in the battery
and i'm charged up, and the catastrophe

maybe this earth is, ain't a good place to be
how far is heaven? let's see
is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
i wonder when i die will he give me receipts?
i wonder will the eyes of the lord look at me?
look at me, look at me, i'm a loser, i'm a winner
i'm good, i'm bad, i'm a christian, i'm a sinner
i'm humble, i'm loud, i'm righteous, i'm a killer

as i open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
my plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
i'm dying inside, i wonder if zion inside the heavens
a condom, a rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a mac-eleven
that's all i see in my life and they tell me to make it right
but i'm right on the edge on everest and i might jump tonight
have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
well it's probably you, am i right? if i'm wrong, you a fucking lie
when i lie on back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
i wonder if i'm just a villain dealing my morals away
some people look at my face, then tell me don't worry bout it
i give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
i'm running, they say i'm wildin', a youngun with lack of guidance
there's hundreds of us with problems, more money, more drugs and violence
look at the soul of an out-of-control artist that's dealing with life the hardest
that's on my life, but regardless i'ma

yeah, life can please ya, but death can tease ya
on the day niko had that seizure, i lost one of my biggest believers, ohh
close deaths make you think about your life
like if i had the same chance twice, what would i do different?
i'd tell her i loved her more, do more
but tease her bout crying on that picture
now when i'm done recording, swear i let the beat bang in her name
make her shake her head in heaven saying they at it again
make them clouds turn to speakers
don't take too much smoke from the reefer
love being in the room with her peoples
now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
lord, what kind of life is this?
mama, i just wanna sing
mama said, according to get everything

we might not change the world, but we gon' manipulate it
i hope you participating
aiyyo dot, won't you let these cats know?
we knew we'd be here like back in 'four
started hiiipower because our generation needed a generator
and the system made to disintegrate us
and all we do is assist 'em
we're not victors, we're victims
the bigger picture isn't developed yet
like, what if kids were celibate?
or what is tammy came across a real man
who didn't play games like chil-dren?
my nigga cheated on his girlfriend
with his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
and everybody tripping off twenty-twelve
and the extraterrestrial presence as well
(odd future's aight) but our future's not
that martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
so keep that question mark on your face
eat your fast-food, use your fluoride toothpaste
hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine-to-five
don't forget to pay your tithes, and thank god you alive (hiiipower)
and on another note
we focussed like the hubble telescope, 'soul

see a lot of y'all don't understand kendrick lamar
because you wonder how i could talk about money, hoes, clothes, god and history
all in the same sentence
you know what all them things have in common?
only half of the truth if you tell it
see i spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
till one day i realised i had to come up with my own
i'm not on the outside looking in, i'm not on inside looking out
i'm in the dead fucking centre looking around
you ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
that's an analogy for the way the world make me react
my innocence been dead
so the next time i talk about money, hoes, clothes, god and history
all in the same sentence
just know i meant it, and you felt it
cause you too are searching for answers
i'm not the next pop star, i'm not the next socially aware rapper
i am a human motherfucking being over dope ass instrumentation

now fuck 'em up terrace

i watch this fire that we're gathered around
and see that it burns similar to the fire that burns inside you
section eighty, section eighty babies
a generation of bliss and disobedience
no they can't control us, no they can't control you
no they can't control us, but we control each other
we build our own world
if you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself
you will leave knowing you represent something that's bigger than all of us
or our family
heart, honor and represent
this is you, this is me, and we are hiiipower

everybody put three fingers in the air
the sky is falling, the wind is calling
stand for something or die in the morning
section eighty, hiiipower

visions of martin luther staring at me
malcolm x put a hex on my future, someone catch me
i'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
the serengeti's clone
back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
you slipped your disc when i slid you my disc
you wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
i got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig, charlotte's web is gonna miss you
my issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
this is physical and mental, i won't sugar-coat it
you'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
and everything on tv just a figment of imagination
i don't want no plastic nation, (dread) that like a haitian
while you motherfuckers waiting, i be off the slave ship
building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

just call the shit hiiipower
nigga, nothing less than hiiipower

visions of martin luther staring at me
if i see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
sorry mama, i can't turn the other cheek
they wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh
and she always told me pray for the weak, uhh
them demons got me, i ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh
dear lord come save me, the devil's working hard
he probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
frightening, so fucking frightening
enough to drive a man insane, i need a license
to kill, i'm standing on a field full of land mines
doing the moonwalk, hoping i blow up in time
cause two thousand and twelve might not be a fucking legend
trying to be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
who said a black man in the illuminati?
last time i checked that was the biggest racist party
so get up off that slave ship
build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

last time i checked that was the biggest racist party
last time i checked, we was racing with marcus garvey
on the freeway to africa till i wreck my audi
and i want everybody to view my autopsy
so you can see exactly where the government had shot me
no conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
they play musical chairs once i'm on that pedestal
frightening, so fucking frightening
enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
the reason lauryn hill don't sing, or kurt cobain
loaded that clip and then said "bang!", the drama it bring
is crazy, product of the late eightys
trying to stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
cause a riot, throw a molotov
somebody told me them pirates had got lost
cause we been off them slave ships
got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

<i>[chorus]</i>
just call the shit hiiipower
yeah, nothing less than hiiipower

lord god, i come to you a sinner
and i humbly repent for my sins
i believe that jesus is lord
i believe that you raised him from the dead
i will ask that jesus will come to my life
and be my lord and savior
i receive jesus to take control of my life
and that i may live for him from this day forth
thank you, lord jesus, for saving me with your precious blood

i met her at this house party on el segundo and central
she had the credentials of strippers in atlanta
ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
i want to ride like arabians, push an 'four mercedes-benz
"hello, my name is kendrick," she said "no, you're handsome."
whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
ciara had played in the background
the parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now
"cool, where you stay?"
she said: "down the street from dominguez high"
okay, i know that's borderline compton or paramount
"well, is it compton?" â "no," she replied
and quickly start battin' her eyes
and strictly had wanted her thighs around me
seventeen, with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
my motive was rather sinful
"what you tryin' to get into?"
she didn't tell, just gave me her nextel
dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and well

the summer had passed, and now i'm likin' her
conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
who could imagine? maybe my actions will end up wifin' her
love or lust, regardless we'll fuck, 'cause the trife in us
it's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
is never muted; in fact, it's much louder where i'm from
we know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
she live with her granny and her younger two brothers
her favorite cousin demetrius's irrepetible
family history of gang bangin' did make me skeptical
but not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
i wanna come over, what's up?
that's what i told her soon as this episode
of martin go off, i'm tryin' to get off
i was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty
probably could hurt me, but fuck it, i got some heart
grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy

so now i'm down rosecrans in a caravan
passin' alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
i got enough to get me through the traffic jam
at least i hope 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
i'm thinkin' about that sex, thinkin' about her thighs
or maybe kissin' on her neck, or maybe what position's next
sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
i looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into corvette
enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
and i'm a professional porn star when off the goose
i had a fifth in the trunk like curtis jackson for ransom
i'm hopin' to get her loose like an uncle luke anthem
i'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
and six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
i pulled up, a smile on my face, and then i see
two niggas, two black hoodies, i froze as my phone rang

please leave your message for three hundred and twenty-three-
record your message after the tone

things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone

i got my drink i got my music i will share it but today i'm yelling
bitch don't kill my vibe

look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
i can feel the changes
i can feel a new life
i always knew life can be dangerous
i can say that i like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
you don't know what pain is
how can i paint this picture
when the color blind is hanging with ya
fell on my face and awoke with a scar
another mistake living deep in my heart
wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
i can admit that it did look like yours
why you resent every making of this
tell me your purpose is petty again
but even a small lighter can burn a bridge
even a small lighter can burn a bridge

i can feel the changes
i can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
you can see that my city found me then put me on stages

i'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
you're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
and i'm looking right past ya
we live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
you live in a world, you living behind the mirror
i know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
this shit is vital, i know you had to
this shit is vital, i know you had to
die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
rather a seasonal name, i'll let the people know this is something you can blame
on yourself you can remain, stuck in a box
i'mma break out and then hide every lock
i'mma break out and then hide every lock

i can feel the changes
i can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
you can see that my city found me then put me on stages
to me that's amazing
to you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

i am a sinner
who's probably gonna sin again
lord forgive me
lord forgive me

bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe

you ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
don't you see that long line
and they waiting on kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
threes in the air i can see you are - in sync
hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
i'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe
walk out the door and they scream it's alive
my new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
talk too motherfucking much, i got my drink i got my music
i say, bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe

aye, k-dot, get in the car, nigga!

martin had a dream
martin had a dream
kendrick have a dream


everybody, everybody, everybody
everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen
to this true mothafuckin' story told by kendrick lamar on rosecrans
ya bish

smoking on the finest dope, aye aye aye aye
drank until i can't no more, aye aye aye aye
really i'm a sober soul but i'm with the homies right now
and we ain't asking for no favors
rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later, aye aye aye aye
really i'm a peacemaker but i'm with the homies right now
and momma used to say
one day, it's gon' burn you out
one day, it's gon' burn you out, out
one day, it's gon' burn you out
one day, it's gon' burn you
but i'm with the homies right now

me and my niggas four deep in a white toyota
a quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
janky stash box when the federales roll up
basketball shorts with the gonzales park odor
we on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
i hope the universe love you today
âcause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
a flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
if itâs necessary
bumping jeezy first album looking distracted
speaking language only we know, you think is an accent
the windows roll down all i see is a hand pass it
hotboxing like george foreman grilling the masses
of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
and asked them what they working with â look at me
i got the blunt in my mouth
usually iâm drug-free, but shit iâm with the homies

(yea nigga, we off a pill and remy red
come through and bust ya head nigga)
me and the homies
(sag all the way to the liquor store
where my niggas pour up four and get twisted some more)
me and the homies
(i ride for my mothafuckinâ niggas
hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
me and the homies
(matter fact, i hop out that mothafucka and be like
âdoo! doo! doo! doo!...doo! doo! doo! doo! doo!â)

itâs two:thirty and the sun is beaming
air conditioner broke and i hear my stomach screaming
hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
iâll tell you to suck my dick then i'll continue eating
we speeding on the four hundred and five passing westchester
you know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good lord
they knew we werenât from âround there
âcause every time we down there we pulling out the boost mobile sim cards
bougie bitches with no extensions
hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
before we sparked a conversation
we seen three niggas in colors we didnât like then started interrogating
i never was a gangbanger, i mean i was never stranger to the folk neither
i really doubt it
rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
thatâs ironic âcause iâve never been violent, until iâm with the homies

(just ridinâ, just ridinâ)
me and the homies
(bullshittinâ, actinâ a fool)
me and the homies
(trippinâ, really trippinâ)
me and the homies
(just ridinâ, just ridinâ, just ridinâ...)

bragging âbout the episode we just had
a shot of hennessey didnât make me feel that bad
iâm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
we tryna conquer the city with disobedience
quick to turn it up, even if we ainât got the cd in
but jeezy still playing and our attitude is still ânigga, what is you sayingâ
pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
the sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(ay, ay, nigga jackpot nigga, pop the safe
ay nigga, i think it's somebody in this room
wait, what?
nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
i hit the back window in search of any nintendo
dvds, plasma screen tvs in the trunk
we made a right, then made a left, then made a right
then made a left, we was just circling life
my mama called â "hello? what you doin'?" âkicking itâ
i shouldâve told her iâm probably âbout to catch my first offense with the homies

but they made a right, they made a left then made a right
then another right
one lucky night with the homies

k. dot, you faded, hood?
yea we finally got that nigga faded. i think he hit the wrong blunt though
ooh, which one?
well which one he talking 'bout? i was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
i pray he ain't hit that
nah, that nigga straight. he ain't hit that one
got the shenanigans? give that nigga the shenanigans
nigga i think we should push back to the city, fo real doe nigga, for what?
what that nigga, what's that jeezy song say nigga?
"last time i checked i was the man on these streets!"
yea, yea, that shit right there. i'm tryna be the nigga in the street
there he go. man you don't even know how the shit go
look, here's the plan luv. we gon' use the kickback as a alibi.
wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop k. dot off at his mama van, at the park,
cause i know he trying to fuck on sherane tonight
that's what heâs not gon' do. then we all gon' meet back at the block at about ten:thirty
that's straight but we should meet up around twelve, i'm tryna fuck on something too

back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
i fucked sherane and went to tell my bros
then usher raymond "let it burn" came on

hot sauce all in our top ramen, ya bish
park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish
the only thing we had to free our mind
then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs

you looking like a easy come-up, ya bish
a silver spoon i know you come from, ya bish
and that's a lifestyle that we never knew
go at a reverend for the revenue

everybody gon' respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
(the one in front of the gun, forever)

and i been hustlin' all day,

<i>[k's mom:]</i> kendrick, just bring my car back, man. i called in for another appointment. i figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways.

<i>[k's mom:]</i> see, he high as hell. shit, and he ain't even tripping off them damn dominoes anymore. just bring the car back!

<i>[k's dad:]</i> did somebody say dominoes?


<i>[intro - kendrick lamar:]</i>
every second, every minute, man, i swear that she can get it
say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
i'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume, go, go

<i>[verse one - kendrick lamar:]</i>
i recognize your fragrance, hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
and i know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh
everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
with poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
i mean i write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
better yet, where your friends and 'em? i really wanna know you all
i really wanna show you off, fuck that
pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
you called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty range i heard that
she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
nigga don't approach her with that atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
they say conversation rule a nation, i can tell
but i could never right my wrongs 'less i write it down for real, p.s

<i>[hook - kendrick lamar:]</i>
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song

<i>[verse two - drake:]</i>
i really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
with all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
you've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
young east african girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
i was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
take you and your momma to the motherland, i could do it
maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
when you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
that sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
you were so new to this life but goddamn, you got adjusted
i mean i write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
good god, what you doing that walk for?
when i see that thing move, i just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
and they say communication save relations, i can tell
but i can never right my wrongs unless i write 'em down for real, p.s

<i>[hook - kendrick lamar:]</i>
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song

<i>[verse three - kendrick lamar:]</i>
every time i write these words, they become a taboo
making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
i'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
i mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
it's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
it's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
a fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
i mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
and i can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
i want that interference, it's coherent, i can hear it, uh-huh
that's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, p.s

<i>[hook - kendrick lamar:]</i>
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song
you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song

<i>[skit:]</i>
"i'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? or it is a problem"
"ay you over here for sherane homie?"
"yo i don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! i'm sorry"
"hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, ok? i'mma tell you where i'm from, ok? you gon' tell me where you from, ok? or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, ok?"

mass hallucination, baby
ill education, baby
want to reconnect with your elations?
this is your station, baby

look inside these walls and you see i'm havin' withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
track attire just tell you i'm tired and ran away
i should ask a choir: "what do you require
to sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"
as the record spin i should pray
for the record, i recognize that i'm easily prey
i got ate alive yesterday
i got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
but what am i 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that i ain't
but know i'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
and live in the street with rank
no better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study
and called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
from a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if i bang
step on my neck and get blood on your nike checks
i don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
the good kid, m.a.a.d city

mass hallucination, baby
ill education, baby
want to reconnect with your elations?
this is your station, baby

all i see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
in all honesty i got time to be copacetic until
you had finally made decision to hold me against my will
it was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
i can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
every time you clock in the morning, i feel you just want to kill
all my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
as a better person; i know you heard this and probably in fear
but what am i 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
and you ask: "lift up your shirt," because you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
i heard 'em chatter: "he's prob'ly young, but i know that he's down
step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
he don't mind, he know we'll never respect
the good kid, m.a.a.d. city."

mass hallucination, baby
ill education, baby
want to reconnect with your elations?
this is your station, baby

all i see in this room: twenty's, xannies and these 'shrooms
grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
society? it's entirely stressful upon my brain
you hired me as a victim, i quietly hope for change
when violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
the silence in this room with twenty's, xannies and 'shrooms
some grown-up candy, i lost it, i feel it's nothin' to lose
the streets sure to release the worst side of my best
don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.a.a.d. city

mass hallucination, baby
ill education, baby
want to reconnect with your elations?

every time i'm in the street, i hear
yawk! yawk! yawk! yawk!

"man down, where you from, nigga?"
"fuck who you know! where you from, my nigga?"
"where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"this m.a.a.d city i run, my nigga"

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
brace yourself, i'll take you on a trip down memory lane
this is not a rap on how i'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
this is cul-de-sac and plenty cognac and major pain
not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
it was me, l boog, and yan yan, yg lucky ride down rosecrans
it got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window â check yourself!
uh, warriors and conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
with society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
at the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
but ever since that day, i was lookin' at him different
that was back when i was nine, joey packed the nine
pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
pack a van with four guns at a time
with the sliding door, fuck is up?
fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
suck a dick or die or sucker punch
a wall of bullets comin' from ak's, ar's, "ayy, y'all, duck!"
that's what momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
you killed my cousin back in 'ninety-four, fuck yo' truce!
now crawl your head in that noose
you wind up dead on the news
ain't no peace treaty, just pieces bg's up to pre-approve
bodies on top of bodies, iv's on top of iv's
obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
when you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
they say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
when we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
you movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec
go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, i guess
m.a.a.d city

"man down, where you from, nigga?"
"fuck who you know! where you from, my nigga?"
"where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"this m.a.a.d city i run, my nigga"

<i>[kendrick lamar + schoolboy q:]</i>
if pirus and crips all got along
they'd probably gun me down by the end of this song

every time i'm in the street, i hearâ
yawk! yawk! yawk!


<i>[mc eiht:]</i>
wake yo' punk-ass up!
it ain't nothin' but a compton thang
g-yeah, real simple and plain
let me teach you some lessons about the street
(smoke somethin', nigga!)
hood ('sup, cuz?)
it ain't nothin' but a compton thang
g-yeah, how we do

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
fresh outta school 'cause i was a high school grad
sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
reality struck, i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
my pops said i needed a job, i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
in fact, i got fired, 'cause i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
i was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
i made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
you know the reasons but still will never know my life
kendrick a.k.a. "compton's human sacrifice"

<i>[mc eiht:]</i>
g-yeah, cocaine, weed
niggas been mixin' shit since the 'eightys, loc
sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
dip, make a nigga flip
cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
one time's crooked and shit
block a nigga in
alondra, rosecrans, bullis, it's compton

i'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
shit, the hood took me under, so i follow the rules
but yeah, that's like me, i grew up in the hood where they bang
and niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
pass it to the left so i can smoke on me
a couple drive-by's in the hood lately
couple of iv's with the fuckin' spray-can
shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
crew i'm finna slay, the street life i crave
shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
mount up, regulators in the whip
down the boulevard with the pistol grip
trip, we in the hood still
so, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
and a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
if i told you i killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
or see me to be innocent kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now and laters to eat?
if i mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
and it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
kill 'em all if they gossip
the children of the corn, they vandalizin' the option
of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
constantly drinkin' and drive
hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
probably go to the projects, i
live inside the belly of the rough, compton, usa
made me an angel on angel dust, what!

now i done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask
back stroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feels
some people wanna kill their sorrows
some people wanna fit in with the popular
that was my problem
i was in a dark room
loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
that i'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
i see the crowd mood
changing by the minute and the record on repeat
took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
i'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
first you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
i wave a few bottles, then i watch 'em all flock

i got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it

i am your conscience, if you do not hear me
then you will be history, kendrick
i know that you're nauseous right now
and i'm hopin' to lead you to victory, kendrick
if i take another one down
i'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
i think that i'm feelin' the vibe
i see the love in her eyes, i see the feelin'
the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
this how you capitalize
this is parental advice
then apparently, i'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
i thought i was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
i'mma show you how to turn it up a notch

<i>[verse one:]</i>
i woke up this morning and figured i'd call you
in case i'm not here tomorrow
i'm hoping that i can borrow a piece of mind
i'm behind on what's really important
my mind is really distorted
i find nothing but trouble in my life
i'm fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction
or a reaction of what we consider madness
i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright
and a fight he tried to put up, but the type
of bullet that stuck had went against his will
as blood spilled on your hands
my plans rather vindictive
everybody's a victim in my eyes
when i ride it's a murderous rhythm
and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back whispering, "get em"
i got em, and i ain't give a fuck
that same mentality i told my brother not to duck
in actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if i'll ever discover
a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a young'n
in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
dumb niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child
i'm proud and well devoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever i'm a push it, wherever whenever
and i love you cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop i hope -

<i>[verse two:]</i>
you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it section.eighty, the message resemble brenda's got a baby
what's crazy was, i was hearin about it
but doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
just put her on blast and shit
judging her past and shit
well it's completely my future
a nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
and i'm a need that forty dollars even if i gotta
fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
gonzales park, i'm followed by a married man, a father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with e's
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes, i run away and never do miss em
see, my hormones just run away and if i can get em back
to where they used to be then i'll probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
you need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
that's how i was taught
three niggas in one room, first time i was tossed
and i'm exhausted
but fuck that "sorry for your loss shit"
my sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
if you can't fit the pumps i walk in?
i'll wait
your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date, just make sure i'm not in the song
cause i don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great?
a doctor's approval is a waste of time, i know i'm straight
i'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
i'll never fade away, i'll never fade away
i know my fate, and i'm on the grind for this cake
i'm a get or die trying, i'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
you lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...

<i>[verse three:]</i>
sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself
am i really scared of passing away
if it's today i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
rake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon
and if i'm doomed, may the wound
help me mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot
and every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
i tie my stomach in knots
and i'm sure not why i'm infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about
cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe cause i'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when i'm a rest
and you're right, your brother was a brother to me
and your sister's situation was the one that put me
in a direction to speak of something that's realer than the tv screen
by any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
her personal life, i was like "it need to be told
cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul"
exactly would have happened if i hadn't continued rappin
or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
fives, i count lives all on these songs
look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i'm gone
now am i worth it?
did i put enough work in?

<i>[i'm dying of thirst]</i>

tired of running
tired of hunting
my own kind
but retiring nothing
tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't?
dying of thirst
dying of thirst
dying of thirst

dope on the corner
look at the coroner
daughter is dead
mother is mourning her
strayed bullets, ak bullets
resuscitation was waiting patiently
but they couldn't, bring her back
who got the footage? channel nine
cameras looking, it's hard to channel your energy
when you know you're crooked
banana clip split his banana pudding
i'm like tre, that's cuba gooding
i know i'm good at
dying of thirst
dying of thirst
dying of thirst

how many sins?
i'm running out
how many sins?
i lost count
dreams of ballin like spalding
but only shotty bounce
the reaper calling
i'm cottonmouth
money is power, yours is ours
lay with a snitch, die with a coward
hope we get rich, hope we can tower
over the city with vanity with the music louder
the same song
a black flower
i'll show you how to
dye your thirst
dye your thirst
dye your thirst

what are we doing?
who are we fooling?
hell is hot, fire is proven
to burn for eternity, return of the student
that never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
tired of running, choirs is humming
tell us to visit, we lying about coming
now back to business, loading the guns in
back of the buick, your hood is feuding
and the beef is bubbling
it's no discussion, hereditary
all of my cousins
dying of thirst
dying of thirst
dying of thirst

too many sins
i'm running out
somebody send
me a well for the drought
see, all i know, is taking notes
on taking this life for granted
granted, if he provoke
my best days, i stress days (lord forgive me for all my sins for i not know...)
my best days, i stress days
say "fuck the world, " my sex slave
money, pussy and greed what's my next crave
whatever it is, know it's my next grave
tired of running, tired of running
i'm tired of tumbling, tired of running
i'm tired of tumbling
backwards my mama say
"see a pastor, give me a promise
what if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
the truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
you dying of thirst
you dying of thirst
so hop in that water, and pray that it works"

i do what i wanna do
i say what i wanna say
when i feel, and i...
look in the mirror and know i'm there
with my hands in the air
i'm proud to say yea
i'm real, i'm real, i'm really really real <i>[xfour]</i>

<i>[verse one:]</i>
i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they tell
sweet lullabies that come with a smell
of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
you living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a never relay a guarantee
and plan c never could say just what it was
and your plans only can pan around love
you love him, you love them, you love her
you love so much, you love when love hurts
you love red-bottom and gold they say queen
you love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
you love french tip and trip that pay for
you love bank slip that tell you we paid more
you love a good hand whenever the card dealt
but what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse two:]</i>
i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they fell
out the sky and your optics? turn stale
where they mow that's green
i can see you fit the bill
of living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a only can make another mistake
and you can't see success coming from plan c
when it all breaks you, you still say you love me
and love them and love when you love her
you love so much, you love when love hurts
you love fast cars and their present is old
you love fast women
you love keepin' control
of everything you love, you love beef
you love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
you love your hood, might even love it to death
but what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse three:]</i>
the reason why i know you very well
cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
the days i tried to cover up and conceal
my pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
when living in a world that come with plan b
a scapegoat cause plan a don't come for free
and plan c just an excuse like because
or the word "but", but what if i got love
i love them, i love when i love her
i love so much, i love when love hurts
i love first verse cause you're the girl i attract
i love second verse cause your the homie they packed
burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
i love what the both of you have to offer
in fact, i love it so much
i don't love anything else
but what love got to do with it when i don't love myself
to the point i should hate everything i do love
should i hate living my life inside the club
should i hate her for watching me for that reason
should i hate him for telling me that i'm season
should i hate them for telling me ball out
should i hate street credibility i'm talkin' about
hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
i'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real

<i>[skit one:]</i>
"... i ain't trippin' off that dominos anymore, just calling, sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like i did homie".

"if i don't hear from you, by tomorrow... i hope you come back, and learn from your mistakes. come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in compton. let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. but when you do make it, give back, with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. to your city... and i love you kendrick, if i don't hear you knocking on the door you know where i usually leave the key. alright? talk to you later, bye."

so i'm saying "what up what up. nigga you made it."
so i'm saying "what up what up. nigga you made it."
so i'm saying "what up what up. nigga you made it."
so i'm saying "what up what up. nigga i hate it."
so i'm saying "what up what up. nigga i hate it."
frustrated and i'm riding down the back streets
making my conscious ask me
"would i survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
black boy fly
black boy fly
black-black boy fly

<i>[verse one]</i>
i used to be jealous of aaron afflalo
i used to be jealous of aaron afflalo
he was the one to follow
he was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
he would live in the gym
we was living in sorrow
total envy of him
he made a dream become a reality
actually making it possible to swim
his way out of compton with further more to accomplish
graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
it's two thousand and four and i'm watching him score thirty
remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
that we was just moving backwards
the bungalow where you find us
the art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
dug inside of his book bag and coach palmer asked for his finals
he had his back like a spinal meanwhile
we singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
eleven graders gone wrong
he focused on the nba we focused on some patron
now watch that black boy fly

<i>[hook]</i>
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy...

<i>[verse two]</i>
i used to jealous of jayceon
i used to jealous of jayceon - taylor when i was young
taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
a buick had driven past bumping him when i mowed the lawn
money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
war's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
the city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
its two thousand and four and i'm hearing the people roar
for the name of the game they line in front of the store
swap meets selling our mixtapes i'm like oh shit, wait
don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
mixed feelings was my opinion i was defending my insecurities
chillin my conscience next to a villain
compton made you believe success wasn't real
be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
so as i peel through these lottery tickets
i see a harley davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
a tall nigga hopped out with jordans and a white tank top
he was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
so watch that black boy fly

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse three]</i>
my mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
like most of the winners call it
regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
that's what she said but in my head i wanted to be like jordan
a boy touring the country with money from mic recording
the only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top forty
and shortly, i got discouraged
like every time i walked to the corner had them guns bursting
nigga, i was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
only one in a million will ever see better days
especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
all these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
they all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
what am i to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
when two niggas making it out had never sounded logical
three niggas making it out, that's mission impossible
so i never believed the type of performance that i could do
i wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got
i was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly...
out of compton

thank god...
black boy fly, watch that black boy fly


<i>[intro: kendrick lamar]</i>
we on?
aight
one, two, three, go!

<i>[verse one: kendrick lamar]</i>
waking up in a dream
sleepwalking on another big stage
you never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
your name and your song, i'm so far away
from the place i used to be, struggling usually
look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
i can feel the energy in the air
it feel like i'm supposed to be here

<i>[bridge one: mary j. blige]</i>
everywhere i go i'm getting so much love
fans, the stars, everyone
sayin how they can't wait for the lp
and i'm gonna blow
they believe in me
feel so good in what you do
helps somebody else get through
that's why i do the best i can
because i know how blessed i am

<i>[hook:]</i>
i'm so high i can touch the sky
i know it's my time
and it's now or never
shine so bright, i light the night
and it feels so right, ain't nothing better

<i>[verse two: kendrick lamar]</i>
a fool if i take it all for granted
a smart man if i keep my feet planted
to the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it
you speakin' outlandish
i'm a show you how to make it all work
another plan, it a short term goal for me
a record sold for me
it's just more of me in your ear
for you to hear kendrick persevere
defenses i feel relentless
ambition with a clear vision
takin' off i ain't takin off these pistons
i'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
came across me, how much it'a cost me
to get you out my business
i set a plan, it's a short term goal, no sky is the limit
i'm past that, now pass that
award, not one but four
times two plus yours

<i>[bridge two: mary j. blige]</i>
i see myself performing there, (k.dot)
sold out shows where the room is packed
sitting at the grammy's winning five awards
see myself on big billboards
traveling around the world with endorsement deals
can't imagine how it feels
that's why i'm smiling everyday
because my dream ain't far away

<i>[hook:]</i>
i'm so high i can touch the sky
i know it's my time
and it's now or never
shine so bright, i light the night
and it feels so right, ain't nothing better

<i>[verse three: kendrick lamar]</i>
you looking at me and you tell me i'm blessed
calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
breathe hums? of a victory and vividly
you see me when at my best, my worst
this verse dedicated to the days that i slept
with a curse research my paid dues i'm reimbursed
i burst in the crowd with a voice and crown
i'm a king on the prowl and i see mama smile?
and i vow on the tape that i'll never break
you can break bread with me now
we can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
and walked that mile
in the darkness i often sit back
and get lost in the rap that i wrote
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
i was talking to you
i was walking it through every ghetto
tell success hello
we here

<i>[bridge three: mary j. blige]</i>
and i'm so happy i cry
cause i can't believe
all the things i ever wanted
are finally happening for me
and it's so surreal
that i almost feel
that any minute i can wake up
from this fantasy
when you pray so hard
and you've come so far
and you know that it's the time for you lift your bar
and i'm gonna do it
watch me!

<i>[hook: xtwo]</i>
i'm so high i can touch the sky
i know it's my time
and it's now or never
shine so bright, i light the night

<i>[verse one: kendrick lamar]</i>
momma take this mothafuckin' block off
tryna reach you everyday, collect calls
never get through, and i go through with drawls
say who told you that i wanted this the
i just wanted to vent or
ask you if you give me your rent for
a attorney, i can pay you back more
soon as i get out, yea every record, shows
commissary running low, i need help
not too much, i hustle up the rest myself
k dot wrote me saying marcus got killed
if you knew me, then you know how bad i feel
wish you prove me wrong, and never came to visit
and i heard she fucking on some other nigga
and my niggas left in the dark, blind
mama kiss the back of me this last time

<i>[hook]</i>
men lie, women lie
men lie, women lie
men lie, women lie
men lie, women lie

if i take you home, will you tell the truth
look at all the bullshit i been through
if i take you home, will you tell the truth

<i>[verse two: kendrick lamar]</i>
mama take this motherfucking block off
thats the date the state will take the blocks off
pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
please believe me, this ain't easy by far
you forgot you're talking to your only son
remember when you put me in that relay run
i was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
you had told me that the very day i won
all i need is you to give me some support
investigation saying that the same report
from a witness just might testify in court
da say i take a deal, or take a loss
i ain't built for all them god damn numbers
god's will, say a prayer for me mama
if you can't, then open up the phone lines
mama just get back at me this last time

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse three: kendrick lamar]</i>
now i tell if i stress take the block off
that's the day the state had take them locks off
i could only help but do so much
bettering yourself, your own crutch
look at your reflection tell me who you see
who is your protection, g-o-d
no its not neglection, i have just accepted
your fate and what its gon' be
remember all the nights that i cried
thinking that my only son just died
peeking through the window, kicking through the door
it's you they looking for, raid outside
rather see you locked up than dead
only you would say that i'm selfish
so before i take the stand, and put this bible in my hand
son, let me say this

<i>[hook]</i>


<i>[intro]</i>
greetings boys and girls

and i'd like to welcome you to good kid, m.a.a.d city (good kid, m.a.a.d city)
so grab your cartoons and cereal (and sing)
your pop guns (and sing) and fireworks and sing along

<i>[chorus]</i>

spend it all in front of the county building
blow it like coltrane, blow it like coltrane yeah

(kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...)

i've been waiting on this day since dr. dre and pac
was on rosecrans in that burger stand at ninety-five
people staring at 'em in amazement
reservations at the days inn
we was living out a hotel at the time
breakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from kentucky fried
mama babysitting section eight vouchers to move
with nothing else to lose but a burger flippin' job
close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine this a mansion
gold ballroom ak-forty-seven dancing
howling at the moon was a pack of hungry babies
hope you feed 'em soon bite your back you die of rabies
everyday we pray to eat at the table of sizzlers
but never made that visit, if better days was on its way
then it made the decision, to make the wrong turn
so for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
(oh yeah i remember that, it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?)

<i>[chorus]</i>
when we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (am i right?)
spend it all in front of the county building (oh)
blow it like coltrane, blow it like coltrane yeah
(don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along)
when we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
spend it all in front of the county building
blow it like coltrane, blow it like coltrane yeah

and all the ghetto children in the world say that's my car
all the ghetto boys say that's my car
all the ghetto girls say that's my car
when we grow up, when we grow up
ghetto children in the world say that's my car
all the ghetto boys say that's my car
all the ghetto girls say that's my car
when we grow up, when we grow up

(nig-nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?)

couple stolen t.v.'s and a seat belt for my safety (uh huh)
played the passenger i think it's five years after eighty-
seven do the math ' ninety-two don't you be lazy (i won't)
looking out the window, notice all the essentials
of a block party that stop for a second then it rekindle
like a flame from a trick candle everybody got dental
insurance 'cause we 'bout to floss
you get that couch i sent you?
i heard that from a block away probably had credentials
of a scholar but shit not today
them dayton spokes was his to take
refrigerators, barbecue pits and jordan kicks
they did invasions while helicopters recorded it
hello mi-mister miyagi i want them ten woo-woofers
say that you got me if not i'll dig in your drawer for it
the swap meet was the bull's eye like tauruses
murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
papa you really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?
he said lil nigga today the poor is rich
don't tell your mom that you seen a molotov bomb
if she ask just know you have to lie and son don't forget
bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't neither
niggas gon' snitch watch the company you keeping
and one day you'll put money in the ghetto when you got it
rather than having to hustle off these rodney king riots
(that's right the mothafuckin' rodney king
you just put your daddy on bullis rd.)

<i>[chorus]</i>
when we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (that's crazy)
spend it all in front of the county building
blow it like coltrane, blow it like coltrane yeah
(don't forget still sing along kids, still sing along)
when we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (please sing)
spend it all in front of the county building
blow it like coltrane, blow it like coltrane yeah

<i>[jay rock]</i>
no syrup in this cup but this that po' up

like a bulemic fiending, for hurl over them toilets
if i run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at?
one bottle, two bottles i'm a soldier, never sober
cup runneth over, don't give a fuck about cirrhosis
one life, that's all we have, ok lets toast to that
then dive in a pool full of liquor, swim laps like michael phelps

<i>[interlude]</i>

<i>[ab-soul]</i>
used to wake up every morning to a glass of alize
hope this dollar shot of e&amp;j will take the pain away
aim and shoot, shots of ciroc will make the girls get loose
with it we all trippin off the hen like a female chicken
you with it? (soul!) spread your wings, you probably won't get far
i honestly wouldn't advise operating a car
try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
and end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
all i, all i, all i, all i have in life is my new appetite for failure
and i got hunger pain that grow insane; tell me do that sound familiar?
if it do then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
is in the bottom of the bottle, and the greenest indo leaf
as the window open i release, everything that corrode inside of me
i see you joking, why you laugh? don't you feel bad? i probably sleep
and never ever wake up; never ever wake up, never ever wake up
in god i trust, but just when i thought i had enough

<i>[outro: kendrick lamar]</i>

<i>[hook:]</i>
at first, i did love you
but now i just wanna fuck
late night thinkin' of you
until i got my nut
tossed and turned, lesson learned
you was my first girlfriend
bridges burned, all across the board
destroyed, but what for?

when i get signed, homie i'mma act a fool
hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
i'mma buy a brand new caddy on fours
trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
married to the game, made a bad bitch yours
when i get signed homie i'mma buy a strap
straight from the cia, set it on my lap
take a few m-sixteens to the hood
pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
i'mma put the compton swap meet by the white house
republican, run up, get socked out
hit the press with a cuban link on my neck
uneducated but i got a million dollar check, like that

forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
anything, see, my name is uncle sam on your dollar
motherfucker you can live at the mall
i know your kind (that's why i'm kind)
don't have receipts (oh man, that's fine)
pay me later, wear those gators
cliche and say, fuck your haters
i can see the borrow in you
i can see the dollar in you
little white lies with a snow white collar in you
but it's whatever though because i'm still followin' you
because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby
then hit the register and make me feel better baby
your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
so you better cop everything two times
two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
too much and enough both we know
christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
get it all, you deserve it kendrick
and when you get the white house, do you
but remember, you ain't pass economics in school
and everything you buy, taxes will deny
i'll wesley snipe your ass before thirty-five

titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious, kept me up watchin'
pornos and poverty, apology? no

fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
more divorce courts and portion
my check with less endorsement left me dormant
dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with

choice is deaf, a state of decapitated the horseman
oh america, you bad bitch, i the picked cotton that made you rich

(oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
i can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer
what the fuck happened?
(oh no) i swore i wouldn't tell
but most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell
(a two man cell)

i should probably run for mayor when i'm done, to be honest
and i put that on my mama and my baby boo too
twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo
ah yeah fuck the judge
i made it past twenty-five and there i was
a little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
life ain't shit but a fat vagina

i remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence


what money got to do with it
when i don't know the full definition of a rap image?
i'm trapped inside the ghetto and i ain't proud to admit it
institutionalized, i keep runnin' back for a visit
hol' up
get it back
i said i'm trapped inside the ghetto and i ain't proud to admit it
institutionalized, i could still kill me a nigga, so what?

<i>[anna wise:]</i>
if i was the president
i'd pay my mama's rent
free my homies and them
bulletproof my chevy doors
lay in the white house and get high, lord
who ever thought?
master take the chains off me

life can be like a box of chocolate
quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
i can just alleviate the rap industry politics
milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
the last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
me scholarship? no, streets put me through colleges
be all you can be, true, but the problem is
a dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
i'll tell you my hypothesis, i'm probably just way too loyal
k dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think i'm a god
truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
but somethin' came over you once i took you to the fuckin' bet awards
you lookin' at artists like the harvests
so many rollies around you and you want all of them
somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
i should've listened what my grandmama said to me

<i>[hook - bilal:]</i>
shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
oh now, slow down

<i>[snoop dogg:]</i>
and once upon a time in a city so divine
called west side compton, there stood a little nigga
he was five foot something, god bless the kid
took his homie to the show and this is what they said

what i'm s'posed to do when i'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
the convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips
the private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?
one more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
my defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
it's the recession, then why the fuck he in king of diamonds?
no more livin' poor, meet my .forty-four
when i see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
now kendrick, know they're your co-workers
but it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
now i can watch his watch on the tv and be okay
but see i'm on the clock once that watch landin' in la
remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
well that's me at these awards
i guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
she said...

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[snoop dogg:]</i>
and once upon a time in a city so divine
called west side compton, there stood a little nigga
he was five foot something, dazed and confused
talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
you can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie
took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
hollywood's nervous
fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service


i remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
sometimes, i did the same

if these walls could talk <i>[xsix]</i>

<i>[anna wise:]</i>
sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
if you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out
its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
and shes plays only when you tell her no

<i>[hook - bilal:]</i>
if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when iâm in it, i love it when iâm in it

if these walls could talk theyâd tell me to swim good
no boat i float better than he would
no life jacket iâm not the guard in nazareth
but your flood can be misunderstood
wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
me? iâm just a tenant
my lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
these walls are vulnerable, exclamation
interior pink, color coordinated
i interrogated every nook and cranny
i mean its still amazing before they couldnât stand me
these walls want to cry tears
these walls happier when iâm here
these walls never could hold up
everytime i come around demolition might crush

<i>[hook]</i>

if these walls could talk theyâd tell me to go deep
yelling at me continuously i can see
your defense mechanism is my decision
knock these walls down thatâs my religion
walls feeling like they ready to close in
i suffocate then catch my second wind
i resonate in these walls
i donât know how long i can wait in these walls
iâve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
they sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
i beg to differ, i mustâve missed them
iâm not involved iâd rather diss them
iâd rather call all you put your wall up
cause when i come around demolition gonâ crush

<i>[hook]</i>

if your walls could talk theyâd tell you itâs too late
your destiny accepted your fate
burn accessories and stash them where they are
take the recipe, the bible and god
wall telling you that commissary is low
race wars happening no calling co
no calling your mother to save you
homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable
your behavior is sammy da bull like a killer that turned snitch
walls is telling me you a bitch
you pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them
that sentence so important
walls telling you to listen to "sing about me"
retaliation is strong you even dream about me
killed my homeboy and god spared your life
dumb criminal got indicted the same night
so when you play this song rewind the first verse
about me abusing my power so you can hurt
about me and her in the shower whenever she horny
about me and her in the after hours of the morning
about her baby daddy currently serving life
and how she think about you until we meet up at night
about the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
and how she fucking on a famous rapper
walls could talk

i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in a hotel room


<i>[tenx:]</i>
loving you is complicated

i place blame on you still
place shame on you still
feel like you ain't shit
feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself
breakin' on marble floors
watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that i'm yours
but you ain't shit i'm convinced your talent's nothin' special
what can i blame him for?
nigga, i can name several
situation had stopped with your little sister bakin'
a baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
where was your antennas, where was the influence you speak of?
you preached in front of one hundred,zero but never reached her
i fuckin' tell you, you're fuckin' failure, you ain't no leader
i never liked you, forever despise you, i don't need you
the world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
thought money would change you, made you more complacent
i fuckin' hate you, i hope you embrace it

<i>[fivex:]</i>
loving you is complicated

lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof
i can feel you vibin', recognize that you're ashamed of me
yes, i hate you too

house keeping
<i>[knocks]</i>
house keeping
â¡abre la puerta! â¡abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
â¡es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuartoâ¡
!disculpe!

and you the reason why mama and them leavin'
no, you ain't shit, you say you love them, i know you don't mean it
i know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
you was deserted, where was your antennas again?
where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?
you ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend
a friend never leave compton for profit, or leave his best friend
little brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him
where was your antennas? on the road, bottles and bitches
you facetime'd the one time, that's unforgiven
you even facetime'd instead of a hospital visit
'cause you thought he would recover, well
the surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real
then he died, god himself will say, "you fuckin' failed."
you ain't try

i know your secrets nigga
mood swings is frequent nigga
i know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
i know you and a couple block boys ain't been speaking, nigga
y'all damn near beefin', i seen it and you're the reason, nigga
and if this bottle could talk <i>[gulp]</i> i cry myself to sleep
bitch, everything is your fault
faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
i know your secrets
don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
and that time you <i>[gulp]</i> i'm 'bout to hurl
i'm fucked up, but ain't as fucked up as you
you just can't get right, i think your heart made of bullet proof
shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
you shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
and if those mirrors could talk it would say, "you gotta go."
and if i told your secrets
the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness


alls my life i has to fight, nigga
alls my life i...
hard times like yah
bad trips like "god!"
nazareth, i'm fucked up
homie you fucked up
but if god got us then we gon' be alright

<i>[hook - pharrell williams:]</i>
nigga, we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright

do you hear me, do you feel me? we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright
huh? we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright
do you hear me, do you feel me? we gon' be alright

uh, and when i wake up
i recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down
what mac-eleven even boom with the bass down
schemin'! and let me tell you bout my life
painkillers only put me in the twilight
where pretty pussy and benjamin is the highlight
now tell my mama i love her but this what i like
lord knows, twenty of 'em in my chevy
tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything i sow
so my karma coming heavy
no preliminary hearings on my record
i'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record
tell the world i know it's too late
boys and girls i think i've gone cray
drown inside my vices all day
won't you please believe when i say

<i>[pre-hook:]</i>
when you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
when our pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"
and we hate popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
i'm at the preacher's door
my knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright

<i>[hook]</i>

what you want, you a house you a car
forty acres and a mule, a piano a guitar
anything, see my name is lucy, i'm your dog
motherfucker you can live at the mall
i can see the evil, i can tell it i know it's illegal
i don't think about it, i deposit every other zero
thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal
diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you
everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
in the presence of your chico... ah!
i don't talk about it, be about it, everyday i see cool
if i got it then you know you got it, heaven, i can reach you
pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog that's all
pick back and chat i shut the back for y'all
i rap, i'm black, on track so rest assured
my rights, my wrongs i write till i'm right with god

<i>[pre-hook]</i>

<i>[hook]</i>

i keep my head up high
i cross my heart and hope to die
lovin' me is complicated
too afraid, a lot of changes
i'm alright and you're a favorite
dark nights in my prayers

i remembered you was conflicted
misusing your influence, sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screamin' in the hotel room
i didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went runnin' for answers


what's wrong nigga?
i thought you was keeping it gangsta?
i thought this what you wanted?
they say if you scared go to church
but remember
he knows the bible too

my baby when i get you get you get you get you
ima go head to ride with you
smoking lokin' poking the deja till i'm idle with you
cause i (want you)
now baby when i'm riding here i'm riding dirty
registration is out of service
smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
cause i (want you)
i want you more than you know

i remember you took me to the mall last week baby
you looked me in my eyes about four five times
till i was hypnotized then you clarified
that i (want you)
you said sherane ain't got nothing on lucy
i said you crazy
roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if i (want you)

<i>[hook]</i>

you said to me
you said your name was lucy
i said where's ricardo?
i said oh no, not the show
than you spit a little rap to me like this
when i turned twenty-six i was like oh shit
you said this to me
i remember what you said too you said
my name is lucy kendrick
you introduced me kendrick
usually i donât do this
but i see you and me kendrick
lucy give you no worries
lucy got million stories
about these rappers i came after when they was boring
lucy gone fill your pockets
lucy gone move your mama out of compton
inside the gi-gantic mansion like i promised
lucy just want your trust and loyalty
avoiding me?
it's not so easy i'm at these functions accordingly
kendrick, lucy don't slack a minute
lucy work harder
lucy gone call you even when lucy know you love your father
i'm lucy
i loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
lucy go get it, lucy not timid, lucy up front
lucy got paper work on top of paper work
i want you to know that lucy got you
all your life i watched you
and now you all grown up then sign this contract if thatâs possible

<i>[hook]</i>

i remembered you was conflicted
misusing your influence, sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screamin' in the hotel room
i didn't wanna self destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went runnin' for answers
until i came home


oh shit!
oh, i need that
i need that sloppy
that sloppy
like a chevy in quicksand
that sloppy

this feelin' is unmatched
this feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
black (pendleton) ball cap
(west, west, west)
we don't share the same synonym fall back
(west, west, west)
been in it before internet had new acts
mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack
my innocence limited the experience lacked
ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer but i did it in fact
you admitted it once i submitted it wrapped in plastic
remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
now i can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
gamblin' benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
winnin' in every decision
kendrick is master and mastered it
isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
thank god for rap, i would say it got me a plaque
but what's better than that?
the fact it brought me back home

<i>[hook:]</i>
we been waitin' for you
waitin' for you
waitin' for you
waitin' for you

i know everything, i know myself
i know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
i know fatality might haunt you
i know everything, i know compton
i know street shit, i know shit that's conscious, i know everything
i know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
i know wisdom, i know bad religion, i know good karma
i know everything, i know history
i know the universe works mentally
i know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
i know everything, i know cars, clothes, hoes and money
i know loyalty, i know respect, i know those that's ornery
i know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
i know if i'm generous at heart, i don't need recognition
the way i'm rewarded, well, that's god's decision
i know you know that lines from compton school district
just give it to the kids, donât gossip about how it was distributed
i know how people work, i know the price of life
i know how much itâs worth, i know what i know and i know it well
not to ever forget until i realized i didnât know shit
the day i came home

<i>[hook]</i>

i met a little boy that resembled my features
nappy afro, gap in his smile
hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him
sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
he looked at me and said kendrick you do know my language
you just forgot because of what public schools had painted
oh i forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous
i used to watch on channel five, tv was takin'
but never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
it's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
and that was bullshit, i mean your life is full of turmoil
you spoiled by fantasies of who you are
i feel bad for you
i can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
if you resist, i'll back off go catch a flight or two
but if you pick, destiny over rest in peace
than be an advocate go tell your homies especially
to come back home

this is a world premiere
this is a world premiere
this is a world premiere

i been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite

i say where you at, from the front to the back
i'm lookin' for you i react, only when you react
ah, i thought i found you, back in the ghetto
when i was seventeen with the .thirty-eight special
maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
maybe i'm paranoid, ha, maybe i don't need you anyway
don't lie to me i'm suicidal anyway
i can be your advocate
i can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is


k dot, pick up the phone, nigga. every time i call, it's going to voice mail.
don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga.

<i>[hook:]</i>
i been a-one since day one, you niggas boo boo

fourteen years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies

so you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga
came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
you wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game
now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up
skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
it goes "sherm sticks, burn this"
thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix
fifty nigga salute, out the compton zoo, with the extras
el cos, monte carlos, road kings and dressers
rip ridaz, p-funkers, mexicans, they fuck with you
asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

<i>[hook]</i>

hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked
the little homies called, they said, "the enemies done cliqued up"
oh yeah? puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
oh, yeah? tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
oh, yeah? everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
the lapd gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer
the streets donât fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
from compton to congress, itâs set trippinâ all around
ainât nothin' new but a flow of new democrips and rebloodlicans
red state versus a blue state, which one you governinâ?
they give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
make it they promise to fuck with you
no condom they fuck with you, obama say, "what it do?"

<i>[hook]</i>

everybody want to talk about who this and who that
who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappinâ
motherfucker if you did, then killer mike'd be platinum
yâall priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
hennessy and crown vic, my memory been gone since
donât ask about no camera back at award shows
no, donât ask about my bitch, no, donât ask about my foes
'less you askin' me about power, yeah, i got a lot of it
iâm the only nigga next to snoop that can push the button
had the coast on standby
âk. dot, what up? i heard they opened up pandoraâs boxâ
i box âem all in, by a landslide
nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
i make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
but i resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with jay
he said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"

i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in a hotel room
i didn't want to self-destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didn't stop survivors guilt
going back and forth
trying to convince my self the stripes i earned
or maybe how a-one my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting
a continuous war back in the city
i was entering a new one


how much a dollar really cost?
the question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
gotta see how iâm chillin' once i park this luxury car
hopping out feeling big as mutombo
twenty on pump six, dirty marcellus called me dumbo
twenty years ago, can't forget
now i can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals
tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
twenty on six, he didn't hear me
indigenous african only spoke zulu
my american tongue was slurry
walked out the gas station
a homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
asked me for ten rand <i>[apprrox $one usd]</i>, stressin' about dry land
deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
a piece of crack that he wanted, i knew he was smokin'
he begged and pleaded
asked me to feed him twice, i didn't believe it
told him, "beat it"
contributin' money just for his pipe, i couldn't see it
he said, "my son, temptation is one thing that i've defeated
listen to me, i want a single bill from you
nothin' less, nothin' more"
i told him i ain't have it and closed my door
tell me how much a dollar cost

<i>[chorus - james fauntleroy:]</i>
it's more to feed your mind
water, sun and love, the one you love
all you need, the air you breathe

he's starin' at me in disbelief
my temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, i grab my key
he's starin' at me, i started the car, then i tried to leave
and somethin' told me to keep it in park until i could see
the reason why he was mad at a stranger
like i was supposed to save him
like i'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
he's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
he's starin' at me, i notice that his stare is contagious
cause now i'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
if i could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
i never understood someone beggin' for goods
askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
and this particular person just had it down pat
starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
have you ever opened up exodus fourteen?
a humble man is all that we ever need
tell me how much a dollar cost

<i>[chorus]</i>

guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
i never met a transient that demanded attention
they got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
i should distance myself, i should keep it relentless
my selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck i'm kiddin'?
so i'mma tell you like i told the last bum
crumbs and pennies, i need all of mines
and i recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
i got better judgement, i know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
when i was strugglin', i did compromise, now i comprehend
i smell grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
i'm imaginin' denzel but lookin' at o'neal
kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
the jig is up, i seen you from a mile away losin' focus
and i'm insensitive, and i lack empathy
he looked at me and said, "your potential is bittersweet"
i looked at him and said, "every nickel is mines to keep"
he looked at me and said, "know the truth, it'll set you free
you're lookin' at the messiah, the son of jehovah, the higher power
the choir that spoke the word, the holy spirit
the nerve of nazareth, and i'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
the price of having a spot in heaven, embrace your loss, i am god"

<i>[ronald isley:]</i>
i wash my hands, i said my grace
what more do you want from me?
tears of a clown, guess i'm not all what is meant to be
shades of grey will never change if i condone
turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs

complexion (two-step)
complexion don't mean a thing (it's a zulu love)
complexion (two-step)
it all feels the same (it's a zulu love)

dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
give a fuck about your complexion, i know what the germans done
sneak (dissinâ)
sneak me through the back window, iâm a good field nigga
i made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
you know i'd go the distance, you know i'm ten toes down
even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

<i>[hook]</i>

dark as the midnight hour, i'm bright as the mornin' sun
brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
sneak (dissin')
sneak me through the back window, iâm a good field nigga
i made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
you know i'd go the distance, you know i'm ten toes down
even if master's listenin', i got the world's attention
so i'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
beauty is what you make it, i used to be so mistaken
by different shades of faces
then wit told me, "you're womanless, woman love the creation"
it all came from god then you was my confirmation
i came to where you reside
and looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
let the willie lynch theory reverse a million times with...

<i>[hook]</i>

you like it, i love it
you like it, i love it

let me talk my stu scott, âscuse me on my twopac
keep your head up, when did you stop? love and die
color of your skin, color of your eyes
thatâs the real blues, baby, like you met jayâs baby
you blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey
all my solomon up north, twelve years a slave
twelve years of age, thinkinâ my shade too dark
i love myself, i no longer need cupid
and forcinâ my dark side like a young george lucas
light donât mean you smart, beinâ dark donât make you stupid
and frame of mind for them bustas, ainât talkinâ âwoohah!â
need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored
like two ties, l-l, you lose two times
if you donât see you beautiful in your complexion
it ainât complex to put it in context
find the air beneath the kite, thatâs the context
yeah, baby, iâm conscious, ainât no contest
if you like it, i love it, all your earth tones been blessed
ainât no stress, jigga boos wanna be
i ainât talkinâ jay, i ainât talkinâ bey
iâm talkinâ days we got school watchinâ movie screens
and spike yourself esteem
the new james bond gonâ be black as me
black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
and itâs all beautiful to me
call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
we all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ainât a thing

barefoot babies with no cares
teenage gun toters that donât play fair, should i get out the car?
i donât see compton, i see something much worse
the land of the landmines, the hell thatâs on earth


everything black, i don't want black
i want everything black, i ain't need black
some white some black, i ain't mean black
i want everything black
<i>[xtwo]</i>

six in the mornin', fire in the street
burn, baby burn, that's all i wanna see
and sometimes i get off watchin' you die in vain
it's such a shame they may call me crazy
they may say i suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
but homie you made me
black don't crack my nigga

i'm the biggest hypocrite of two thousand and fifteen
once i finish this, witnesses will convey just what i mean
been feeling this way since i was sixteen, came to my senses
you never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, i meant it
i'm african-american, i'm african
i'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
pardon my residence
came from the bottom of mankind
my hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
you hate me don't you?
you hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
you're fuckin' evil i want you to recognize that i'm a proud monkey
you vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
and this is more than confession
i mean i might press the button just so you know my discretion
i'm guardin' my feelins, i know that you feel it
you sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

<i>[hook:]</i>
i said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
and man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
how you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
but now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
all them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
remember this, every race start from the black, just remember that

i'm the biggest hypocrite of two thousand and fifteen
once i finish this, witnesses will convey just what i mean
i mean, it's evident that i'm irrelevant to society
that's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
curse me till i'm dead
church me with your fake prophesyzing that i'mma be just another slave in my head
institutionalize manipulation and lies
reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
you hate me don't you?
i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
jealous of my wisdom and cards i dealt
watchin' me as i pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
black and successful, this black man meant to be special
cat scans on my radar bitch, how can i help you?
how can i tell you i'm making a killin'?
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

<i>[pre-hook]</i>

<i>[hook]</i>

i'm the biggest hypocrite of two thousand and fifteen
when i finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree
this plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
it's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
i'm african-american, i'm african
i'm black as the heart of a fuckin' aryan
i'm black as the name of tyrone and darius
excuse my french but fuck you â no, fuck y'all
that's as blunt as it gets, i know you hate me, don't you?
you hate my people, i can tell cause it's threats when i see you
i can tell cause your ways deceitful
know i can tell because you're in love with the desert eagle
thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
it's funny how zulu and xhosa might go to war
two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
remind me of these compton crip gangs that live next door
beefin' with piru's, only death settle the score
so don't matter how much i say i like to preach with the panthers
or tell georgia state "marcus garvey got all the answers"
or try to celebrate february like it's my b-day
or eat watermelon, chicken, and kool-aid on weekdays
or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements
or watch bet cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street?
when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
hypocrite!


study long, study wrong, nigga
hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker
close that door!

hey, hey, babe check it out, imma tell you what my mama had said, she like:

i could spot you a mile away
i could see your insecurities written all on your face
so predictable your words, i know what you gonna say
who you foolin'? oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
with the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
circus acts only attract those that entertain
small talk, we know that it's all talk
we live in the laugh factory every time they mention your name

<i>[bridge:]</i>
askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me
askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me
say you got to burn your stash to impress me
it's all in your head, homie
askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me

you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard

and the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you

reputation can't protect you if you never had one

what do you got to offer?

been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit
instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is
niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie
this is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts
you can never persuade me
you can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
or you, the truth you love to bend
in the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
on the couch, in the mouth, i'll be out, really though
so loud, rich niggas got low money

i've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
duckin' every other blessin', i can never see the message
i could never take the lead, i could never bob and weave
from a negative and letting them annihilate me
and it's evident i'm moving at a meteor speed
finna run into a building, lay my body...

not on my time, not while i'm up here
not on my time, kill the music

we could save that shit for the streets

i promised dave i'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
he said, "think about what you saying: 'fuck niggas'
no better than samuel on django
no better than a white man with slave boats"
sound like i needed some soul searching
my pops gave me some game in real person
retraced my steps on what they never taught me
did my homework fast before government caught me
so i'm a dedicate this one verse to oprah
on how the infamous, sensitive n-word control us
so many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
well, this is my explanation straight from ethiopia
n-e-g-u-s definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
n-e-g-u-s description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
the history books overlook the word and hide it
america tried to make it to a house divided
the homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
so i'm a break it down and put my game in a song
n-e-g-u-s, say it with me
or say no more. black stars can come and get me
take it from oprah winfrey, tell her she right on time
kendrick lamar, by far, realest negus alive


the ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it
let these words be your earth and moon
you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

the ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it
let these words be your earth and moon
you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

do you believe in me? are you deceiving me?
could i let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
is your smile on permanent? is your vow on lifetime?
would you know where the sermon is if i died in this next line?
if i'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
if the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
would you judge me a drug-head or see me as k. lamar
or question my character and degrade me on every blog
want you to love me like nelson, want you to hug me like nelson
i freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
you tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
but a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question:

when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

the ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it
let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and with that

do you believe in me? how much you believe in her?
you think she gon' stick around if them twenty-five years occur?
you think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
you think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
like who got your best interest?
like how much are you dependent?
how clutch are the people that say they love you?
and who pretending?
how tough is your skin when they turn you in?
do you show forgiveness?
what brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
what kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
what kind of bridge did they burn?
revenge or your mind when it's mentioned?
you wanna love like nelson, you wanna be like nelson
you wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom
you wanna be remembered that delivered the message
that considered the blessing of everyone
this your lesson for everyone, say

when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

the voice of mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
let my word be your earth and moon
you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and if you riding with me, nigga

i been wrote off before, i got abandonment issues
i hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
that's not nelson-like, want you to love me like nelson
i went to robben's island analysing, that's where his cell is
so i could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
see i got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
murphy's law, generation x, will i ever be your x?
floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth of
pit bulls, put me under stress
crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect
but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
how many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?
is it moses, is it huey newton or detroit red?
is it martin luther, jfk, shoot or you assassin
is it jackie, is it jesse, oh i know, it's michael jackson, oh

when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
that nigga gave us "billie jean", you say he touched those kids?
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

the ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it
let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
"i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power, full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in the hotel room
i didn't wanna self destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didn't stop survivor's guilt
going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
or maybe how a-one my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, i was entering a new one
a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned
the word was respect
just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
doesn't mean i can't respect you as a black man
forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
if i respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
but i don't know, i'm no mortal man, maybe i'm just another nigga"

shit and that's all i wrote
i was gonna call it
another nigga but, it ain't really a poem, i just felt like it's
something you probably could relate to. other than that, now that i
finally got a chance to holla at you, i always wanted to ask you about a
certain situa--, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground.
what you mean 'bout that, what the ground represent?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
right

<i>[twopac:]</i>
that's how i see it, my word is bond. i see - and
the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna
open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. cause the rich
people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what i'm
saying, wealthy, appetising. the poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you
know what i'm saying it's gonna be likeâ¦ there might be some cannibalism
out this mutha, they might eat the rich

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
aight
so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that's
rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i
see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of
the word. i took nothin', i took the opportunities, i worked at the most
menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where
i owned it. i went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the
person that works my management company. i changed everything i realized
my destiny in a matter of five years you know what i'm saying i made
myself a millionaire. i made millions for a lot of people now it's time
to make millions for myself, you know what i'm saying. i made millions
for the record companies, i made millions for these movie companies, now
i make millions for us

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
and through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
by
my faith in god, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in "all good
things come to those that stay true." you know what i'm saying, and it
was happening to me for a reason, you know what i'm saying, i was
noticing, shit, i was
punching the right buttons and it was happening. so it's no problem, you
know i mean it's a problem but i'm not finna let them know. i'm finna
go straight through

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
shit,
i like to think that at every opportunity i've ever been threatened
with resistance, it's been met with resistance. and not only me but it
goes down my family tree. you know what i'm saying, it's in my veins to
fight back

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
aight well, how long you think it
take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, i'm fighting a war i
can't win and i wanna lay it all down

<i>[twopac:]</i>
in this country a
black man only have like five years we can exhibit maximum strength, and
that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while
you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. cause
once you turn thirty it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man,
out of a black man in this country. and you don't wanna fight no more.
and if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud
mouth thirty-year old muthafuckas

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
that's crazy,
because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i
can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so i wanted
to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be, like, uh, bloodshed for real. i don't think america
know that. i think american think we was just playing and it's gonna be
some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. it's gonna be
murder, you know what i'm saying, it's gonna be like nat turner, one thousand, eight hundred and thirty-one,
up in this muthafucka. you know what i'm saying, it's gonna happen

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
that's
crazy man. in my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music
and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is.
sometimes i be like, get behind a mic and i don't know what type of
energy i'mma push out, or where it comes from. trip me out sometimes

<i>[twopac:]</i>
because the spirits, we ain't even really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
damn

i wanted to read one last thing to you. it's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. it says:

"the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
the butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
but
having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as
weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
he can no longer see past his own thoughts
he's trapped
when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
the result?
wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same."

what's your perspective on that?
pac? pac?
pac?!


come here, girl
oh, you want me to touch you right there?
oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
oh you want it? oh you want it right now
like that? i got you baby
all on you baby
push it back on daddy
push it back on daddy baby

i seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life isâ¦
i seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
life is long as infinity this was the final calling
no birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
we all nervous and crying, moving in caution
in disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this
the tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
the ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
with a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
the smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid
rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
valleys and high places turn into dust
famous screaming in agony
atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling âheâs aliveâ
backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
public bathroom, college classroomâs been deserted
another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(itâs happening) no more running from world wars
(itâs happening) no more discriminating the poor
(itâs happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
i swore i seen it vividly
a moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
thunder like number four, then i heard
âwhat have you did for meâ
i fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
that dated back to june seventeenth, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven
my paperwork was like a receipt
i was valedictorian, i was fearful of judgment
but confident i had glory in all my past endeavors
close my eyes pray to god that i live forever
dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
geez louise i thought you said that i excel
i made to pimp a butterfly âfore you told me
to use my vocals to save man-kind for you
say i didnât try for you, say i didnât ride for you
i tithed for you, i pushed the club to the side for you
who love you like i love you?
crucifix, tell me you can fix
anytime i need, iâmma start jotting everything in my diary
never would you lie to me
always camaraderie, i can see, our days been numbered
revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
all man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
i guess iâm running in place trying to make it to church

young nigga act an ass
young nigga act a fool
young nigga get yoâ cash
young nigga do what it do
young nigga go, young nigga go
young nigga go, young nigga go
whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
just take it all back before the light switch

so i met this young lady, ya know, when i went back home. i was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like snaps. i said âyou know what, girl? you crazy.â then she asked me what he said

<i>[kendrick lamar and anna wise:]</i>
(what did the asian say?)
a peace of mind
thatâs what the asian said, i need a divine
intervention was his religion and i was surprised
him believing in buddha, me believing in god
asked him what are you doing, he said âtaking my timeâ
meditation is a must, it donât hurt if you try
see you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
worried about your career, you ever think of your health?
(what did the indian say?)
a piece of land
thatâs what the indian said, i needed demand
telling me longevity is in the dirt, should buy some property first
should profit a better dollar with generational perks
equity at his best, really, you should invest
these tangible things expire, donât you expect
income with so much outcome and yes
look at my heritage, we blessed
(now what the black man say?)
a piece of pussy
thatâs what the black man said, i needed to push me
to the limit to satisfy my hunger
we do it all for a woman from hair cut to a wool
we like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
what you saying to me?
he said ânigga, come back to reality for a weekâ
pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
i wouldnât be prouder, you should allow it
(what the white man say?)
a piece of mineâs
thatâs what the white man wanted when i rhyme
telling me that he selling me just for $ten.ninety-nine
if i go platinum from rapping, i do the company fine
what if i compromise? he said it donât even matter
you make a million or more, you living better than average
you losing your core following, gaining it all
he put a price on my talent, i hit the bank and withdraw
hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
put myself in the rocket ship and i shot for the stars
look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
iâmma make you some promises that you just canât ignore
your profession anonymous as an artist
if i donât target your market
if you ainât signing your signature when i throw you my wallet
a lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
you work toward your masterâs mortgage, i need a piece

somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me

somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
and this i know

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
i got one hundred on my dash, got two hundred in my trunk
name in the grab bags, put my bible in the trunk
taaka vodka on the top of my binocular iâm drunk
how can i can make them popular, pop emâ when i want
see iâm livinâ with anxiety, duckinâ the sobriety
fuckinâ up the system i ainât fuckinâ with society
justice ainât free, therefore justice ainât me
so i justify his name on obituary
why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
once upon a time i used to go to church and talk to god
now iâm thinkinâ to myself, hollow tips is all i got
now iâm drinkinâ by myself, at the intersection, parked
watch you when you walk inside your house
you threw your briefcase all on the couch
i plan on creeping through your fuckinâ door and blowinâ out
every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain
iâm gone

drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippinâ the handle
lit off henny, iâm tryna dismantle
these wicked ways, iâve engaged in such a gamble
cause i could speak the truth and i know the world would unravel, wait
thatâs a bit ambitious maybe iâm trippinâ
maybe iâm crazy, maybe i exist in a different dimension
not to mention when i close my eyes i see the distance
itâs such a scary sight so i rarely go to sleep at night
i watch the sun rise then i watch the sun fall
studied the son of god but still donât recognize my flaws
i guess iâm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
i pray my experience helps you
as for me iâm tryna sort it out
searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
but who knows?
i just need a little space to breathe
i know perception is key, so i am king

<i>[kendrick lamar and jay rock:]</i>
the other side has never mortified my mortal mind
the borderline between insanity is father time
i fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that iâm blind
i know that iâm intelligence, my confidence just died
carpe diem, seize the day, i canât compromise
a tape worm couldnât cure this gluttonous appetite
a couple trinkets, they seein me as i pacify
but couldnât fathom the meaning of seeinâ sacrifice
iâm passinâ lives on a daily, maybe iâm losing faith
genocism and capitalism just made me hate
correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
professional dream killers reason why iâm awake
iâm sleep walkinâ, iâm street stalkinâ, iâm outta place
reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
before i blink do i see me before them pearly gates?
or this is just a mirage or a facade
wait


these metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what i see
a gemini, duality personalities always conflict in me

<i>[kendrick lamar &amp; ceelo green:]</i>
oh! but donât be scared of me, girl
i can explain
i know itâs foreign to you
i know itâs hard to believe
god give me the favor
let me explain
more than a compliment
and i could use some assistance, let me show you how
i can explain
oh shando! i spin around two times
iâll be there with the answer

any misunderstandings, baby
let me explain
i can explain it
why donât you sit and talk to me?
i can explain
let me explain it, ah yeah

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
my mama told me that i was different the moment i was invented
estranged baby, no iâm not ashamed
i recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
you know the male species can be redundant
i mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
between sheets, covers and pillows
iâm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
iâm promising that iâm acknowledging you as my hero
cause you believe in me
no youâre not easily impressed
but i possess qualities that you need to see
look at my flaws, look at my flaws
look at my imperfections in awe
look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
and yours equally valued
you stick out like an alien compared to those around you
and thatâs alright because i like it
you and me are the same
hopefully iâm invited, hopefully you donât change
because i know for sure who you are

<i>[kendrick lamar &amp; ceelo green:]</i>
i can explain
your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
hand washing your clothes on sunday
let me explain
walking your brother to school, three miles away
to feed him knowledge
i can explain
donât you explain that, donât you explain the reason why your mind, it travels
let me explain
i wanna know what you think
i wanna pick your brain when i see you
but donât you ever
let me explain
oh shando!
i spin around two times, a blessing in disguise
i can explain
i know for sure who you are
youâre the goddess of the odd
i am yours

she said iâm down on my luck
and itâs something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money, and itâs breaking me down honey

two tears in the bucket i cry with you
but i could never lie with you
i could never afford not to afford
i could never put my plans to the side with you
i could never see a red light
like a deer with a headlight
i freeze up when i re-up
see i barely have patience
and you're relating
only the moment to complete us
why you hate to work for it?
the reason i never went to work for it
see a nine to five was so jive turkey
but when thanksgiving came that check didnât hurt me
you plead the fifth
i read the fifth amendment
we both criminals with bad intentions
they say time heals all
but if i can shortcut
my success, corvettes by tomorrow

she tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
i know you, woman, i console you, woman
you feel like the universe owes you, woman
oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
bitches don't prosper chasing education
but you're talented, and can't handle it
and your homegirls can't be your manager
three hundred and sixty-five times four, plus more
if yan't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?

my accolades better than all them

i wrote this song looking at a broke home baby
you know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies
somebody yell "kendrick american, they shoâ is crazy"
and i said âwhy?â
then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up"
youâre banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
you never been through shit, youâre crying hysterical
you settle for everything, complain about everything
you say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
your projects ainât shit, i live in a hut bitch
i'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
i paid my way through by waiting on allah
you played your way through, by living in sci-fi
bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
same thing goes for the ones you came with
when y'all came on the boat looking for hope
and all you can say is that youâre looking for dope
these days ainât no compromise
and your pain ainât mines half the time
a brand new excuse ainât shit to me
bitch i made my moves, with shackled feet

in today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
you wait on them, him and her

so i was takin' a walk the other day, and i seen a woman-a blind woman-pacin' up and down the sidewalk. she seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. so after watchin' her struggle for a while, i decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? "hello, ma'am, can i be of any assistance? it seems to me that you have lost something. i would like to help you find it." she replied: "oh yes, you have lost something. you've lost... your life."

lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song, quote: "and we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'..."
oh please, ugh, i don't like it.

fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
fill up the banks with dollars
fill up the graves with fathers
fill up the babies with bullshit
internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
i feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'pac was
the feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
but nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
the feelin' is toxic, i feel like i'm boxin' demons
monsters, false prophets schemin'
sponsors, industry promises
niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, compton
church, religion, token blacks in bondage
lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
fuck your feelings, i mean this for imposters
i can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
i can feel it, the dream is more than process
i can put a regime that forms a loch ness

see, in the perfect world, i would be perfect, world
i don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
i don't love people enough to put my faith in men
i put my faith in these lyrics, hoping i make amend

i probably won't come around
this time, i might put you down
last time, i ain't give a fuck, i still feel the same now
my feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
i'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from

seems like i point the finger just to make a point nowadays
smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
i know the walls, they can listen, i wish they could talk back
the hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
a perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
promises are broken and more resentment come alive
race barriers make inferior of you and i
see, in a perfect world, i'll choose faith over riches
i'll choose work over bitches, i'll make schools out of prison
i'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service

fumbled my jewelry, one hundredk, i lost a new chain

take me a nap and do it again

lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true

none of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
time passin', things change
revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways; lust

lately, i feel like i been lustin' over the fame
lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
lately, lately, lately, my lust been hidin' (lately)
lately, it's all contradiction

johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo')
johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
god bless america, you know we all love him

yesterday i got a call like from my dog like one hundred and one
said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
he was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
talkin' out his head, philosphin' on what the lord had done
he said: "k-dot, can you pray for me?
it's been a fucked up day for me
i know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
he was lookin' for some closure
hopin' i could bring him closer
to the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but i told him
"i can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how i feel:
if somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
all the memories collected, moments you could never touch

i'll wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
i'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all i got
i'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
walk myself to the court like, "bitch, i did that!"
ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
i can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
it be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
let somebody touch my mama
touch my sister, touch my woman
touch my daddy, touch my niece
touch my nephew, touch my brother

when i was twenty-seven, i grew accustomed to more fear
accumulated ten times over throughout the years
my newfound life made all of me magnified
how many accolades do i need to block denial?
the shock value of my success put bolts in me
all this money, is god playin' a joke on me?
is it for the moment, and will he see me as job?
take it from me and leave me worse than i was before?
at twenty-seven, my biggest fear was losin' it all
scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
scared to go back to section eight with my mama stressin'
thirty shows a month and i still won't buy me no lexus
what is an advisor? somebody that's holdin' my checks
just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
i read a case about rihanna's accountant and wondered
how did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
the type of shit'll make me flip out
and just kill somethin', drill somethin'
get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
i practiced runnin' from fear, guess i had some good luck
at twenty-seven years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
how they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
what they say 'bout me reveal
if my reputation would miss me
what they see from me
would trickle down generations in time
what they hear from me
would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
i'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'cause my dna won't let me involve in the light of god
i'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
i'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
i'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me
so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me
so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
wonderin' if i'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap

verse two says you only have i known of all the families of the earth, therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities. so until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse. because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called blacks, hispanics, and native american indians, are the true children of israel. we are the israelites according to the bible. the children of israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the lord, thy god, chasten thee. so, just like you chasten your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. so that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. we're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the united states of america. i love you, son, and i pray for you. god bless you, shalom.

oh lamar, hail mary and marijuana, times is hard
pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
fellowship with demons and relatives, i'm a star
life is one funny mothafucka
a true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
i might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
see, once upon a time inside the nickerson garden projects
the object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
anthony was the oldest of seven
well-respected, calm and collected
laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, momma on crack
a four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
his family history: pimpin' and bangin'
he was meant to be dangerous
clocked him a grip and start slangin'
fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
even got some head from a smoker last weekend
dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
ten,zero dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
had a couple of shooters
caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
but witnesses couldn't prove it
that was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
he beat the case and went back to hustlin'
bird-shufflin', anthony rang
the first in the projects with the two-tone mustang
that five.zero thing, they say five-zero came
circlin' parking lots and parking spots
and hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
crooked cops told anthony he should kick it
he brushed 'em off and walked back to the kentucky fried chicken
see, at this chicken spot
there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
with a curly top and a gap in his teeth
he worked the window, his name was ducky
he came from the streets, the robert taylor homes
southside projects, chiraq, the terror dome
drove to california with a woman on him and five hundred dollars
they had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
cadillac seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'cross the street from the projects, anthony planned to rob it
stuck up the place before, back in 'eighty-four
that's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
so many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
prevalent proposition with nine's
ducky was well-aware
they robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
he figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
free chicken every time anthony posted in line
two extra biscuits, anthony liked him and then let him slide
they didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
one curse at a time
reverse the manifest and good karma, and i'll tell you why
you take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
because if anthony killed ducky, top dawg could be servin' life
while i grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
tell me what you gon' do to me
confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
you can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
but you can't bring the truth to me
fuck you and all your expectations
i don't even want your congratulations
i recognize your false confidence
and calculated promises all in your conversation
i hate people that feel entitled
look at me crazy 'cause i ain't invite you
oh, you important?
you the moral to the story? you endorsin'?
motherfucker, i don't even like you
corrupt a man's heart with a gift
that's how you find out who you dealin' with
a small percentage who i'm buildin' with
i want the credit if i'm losin' or i'm winnin'
on my momma, that's the realest shit

love, let's talk about love
is it anything and everything you hoped for?
or do the feeling haunt you?
i know the feeling haunt you

this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

skin covered with ego
get to talkin' like a end-forth, like a rebound
no control, no off switch
in the way that you bringin' me down
it's a turn on, get it away from me
know you mean wrong, keep away from me
and it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
i just cry for no reason
i just pray for no reason
i just thank for the life, for the day
for the hours and another life breathin'
how did it all go to feel good?
you could live it all if you feel bad
better live your life
we were runnin' out of time

love, let's talk about love
is it anything and everything you hoped for?

it feels like i only go backwards baby
every part of me says "go ahead".
i got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
feels like we only go backwards darling.

<i>[verse one:]</i>
and we'll be screaming out "no rules, no rules"
feel the energy we go through, i told you
pump my fist like i'm supposed to, i showed you
my vision of the unsocial, is so cool
look around me and just see the same, who to blame?
see my generation has no shame, i play the game
how i see it this is inside the future, this is nothing that you're used to
i refuse to play the victim my religion is to move you
out your power position my army head on collision
cant harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
every time that i zone in
nothing is more convincing than telling you that i won't bend
break or fake partition
i can't, this is my life design
this is me taking mines, this is what i live for
this is me taking yours, this is more than cfour
this is what happens when we're ready to build and destroy
i hope that you enjoy

<i>[tame impala]</i>
it feels like i only go backwards baby
every part of me says "go ahead".
i got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.
feels like we only go backwards darling.

<i>[verse two:]</i>
i live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me
pedal through this underworld undertakers won't catch me
system make no sense don't feel justice if you would ask me
i'll tell you everything is corrupted don't you walk passed me
with the condescending look i can tell you're pretending
like you my friends and you just a henchman i feel relentless
i feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
or cut you with it i come from a glove that breed a nuisance
trespass on your property i am properly aiming to go and get your democracy
this is me changing faces cuz i can stand alone and die alone as long as i got pride
the victory and fight is all in my eyes
the night is young and i can see your demise
i'm waiting for it
you can't ignore it you live dormant
i die enormous
big as the lies you tell i can tell that you feel defeated
the truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason
capisce

<i>[tame impala]</i>
it feels like i only go backwards baby
every part of me says "go ahead".
i got my hopes up again, oh no... not again.

man, beyonce, i'm mad at you, man

<i>[chorus one]</i>
they say hello (hey), hello (hey)
i can daydream about beyonce all day
thinking bout the good times 'fore she met jay
see ya know, they say hello (hey), hello (hey)
i really thought i had a chance to be your man
till i seen the video with the ring on your hand
it hurt me so

i remember you were sixteen on the tv screen with wyclef
were you my type? oh god yes, i was impressed
you was like 'no, no, no', i was like twelve years old
hoping that one day i could chaperone while you're on the road
you wore braids with a banging body
looked like you did pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
but bump that, i was there from the start
even when letoya luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
hope you didn't cry, cause honestly they were just so-so
they couldn't sing anyway, you deserved to go solo
no disrespect to kelly and michelle, i'm just saying
they cool, but you? you something like wonder woman
and i just want to hold your hand, bring you to compton
gonzales park, we can build castles in the sand
eating hot cheetos with pickle juice in it
put that napkin down, you know i'll lick your fingers when you're finished

<i>[chorus one]</i>

i just bought the sasha fierce cd
i gazed at the cover for a whole five minutes till my girlfriend hit me
she's jealous of you b cause i don't love her like i love you
i even make her do the "uh-oh, uh-oh, oh-no-no" just like you do
she tell me i'm obsessed, i tell her we connect
like ice cube way before the mack ten feud
she like, you goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke
i said, so, i'm five-hundred mill' away, there's still hope
anyway, i had feelings way before you got paid
and i didn't laugh when you bust your ass on the stage
and i salute kanye for taking up for you
i would have stole the award just to prove that i love you
but jay shoulda did that, i thought he had your bizzack
what happened mr. izzo? hopico with frederico?
he used to be my favorite till he abandoned my diva
now i tell everybody nas had killed him on 'ether'

<i>[chorus two]</i>
they say hello (hey), hello (hey)
i can daydream about beyonce all day
thinking bout the good times 'fore she met jay
see ya know, they say hello (hey), hello (hey)
hopefully i still have a chance
maybe if i sabotage your man
you never know, hmm

i'ma sneak backstage at a mary j. blige concert
with an 'i love mary' shirt, then find jay-z
and push him into a dancer, hopefully they lock lips
that's when i yell out, sounwave, hurry up, take the pic
put it on bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
publicity like that? yep, they'd be sure to fight
better yet i'ma steal his cell, then call up affion
he impersonates jay well, get beyonce on the line
then make up some bogus shit
like you don't the back of my knees right, so this marriage is over with
and the ring that's on my finger, guess what, i'm throwing it (cling)
you heard the sound, so you know i did
ha-hahhh, that should get him
i should break 'em up like a kit kat when i do that, yeah true that
i'ma put the plot in motion, that's for sure
but if i end up with macy gray, this plan never worked

yeeeea, man i hope jay don't be mad at me bout this song
start-, ay wizzle start me back from like the first verse
like right before i come in
haha, what you say? nah, you think it'll be hot for real though?
nigga, you stupid, they probably laughing as hard as you
nig' got the best wife in the world and shit
run that back though?


<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
i am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
lord forgive me, lord forgive me
things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone

i got my drink, i got my music
i would share it but today i'm yelling
bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe

i look at the game and see porn there
i'm fuckin' this industry hard
i'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
you thought i was fresh out the yard
don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
they tell me you nice and i'm like "wait"
go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
and when the stakes are high, i stake out for days
and when the water reside, you're bobby boucher
but we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
i got a peighty-nine in a suitcase
i know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
lyrical exercise
right now, homie, i'm in the extra vibe
pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that i got these words
to the upper echelon, that's excellent

i am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
lord forgive me, lord forgive me
things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone
bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
i can feel your energy from two planets away
i got my drink, i got my music
i would share it but today i'm yelling
bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe

<i>[jay-z:]</i>
up in the clouds, me and my spouse
rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
please turn them shits down, can't hear myself think
turbulence, shit, almost spilled my drink
in the white house with a mink
running through that bitch like it's my house
all up in the hall like a mall
told you motherfuckers, all i do is ball
no, i don't 'member you, i don't intend to empty my memory bank
it's a million dollars in it, baby, hilary swank
sittin' next to hillary smellin' like dank
presidental pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
i'll wait
i've been in my wave like twenty years straight
i've been on my vibe like twenty years straight
don't fuck up my high, fuck up my high
nights like this, i could fuck up a pie
an still be straight (still be straight)
fall back, bitch, i got a lot on my plate
don't waste my breath
i don't know how many moons a nigga got left
back to this joint, smokin' this shit like i'm tryna' prove a point
i'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral

<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off
i ministered this generation by far
leader of the new school, on my toes like a ballerina
who knew i'd be black swan
world in my palms, ironically
i am the globetrotters' best
'cause i didn't drop the ball
told niggas when i was sixteen that i'd write a sixteen
to put a nigga right on the big screen
in the paddy wagon with six teens
should have been in the pen but now my pen write with morphine
i heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
i kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
cardio lap, was running for dear life but now i'm running the map
bitch, i'm here nigga
picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
nigga you never be jay, never be nas, never be snoop nor dre
you ain't get killed in vegas or in a suburban
nigga, puff daddy wasn't your favorite
so many washed up with detergent
but i don't dry tears, i just aim at them on purpose
like blah, mini-fourteen like blah
empty out another magazine like blah
let a young nigga get by
i kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe
i am the bad, the good god, the last the hood got
the last that would try to pass a good job
if shawn's a black beatle then i need a ten second drum solo
bitch see you at woodstock


dick hard like rottweiler
can you handle it? can you handle it? woo woo, woo woo

the whole industry been in shambles
everybody fugazi, i'm just changing the channel
kendrick lamar, the people's champion, i'm animal for analysts
career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
i like my raps extra prolific
since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
and i won't mention my ten thousand hours in training
while juggling gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
and now we look at the competition as quick submission
they tappin' out before we even get a chance to miss âem
what this about, is it money or skill?
maybe it's both and i got large amounts of it, it's real
you see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
i can see y'all incapable
to be the god emcees, you know me well
ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
run for cover, my lineage prove itself
i'm rollin' deep in that paper like two adeles
before scholars, i flowed tighter than virgin lips
we had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
everything is high stakes nowadays, that's how it played nowadays
it's like an eight-ball to the face nowadays
i'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
it's seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, i'm talking
hiiigher power, every other hour since eddie bauer
since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
and the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
this is what they want, i'm the one
this is vintage from nineteen-eighty-somethin'
i'm the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
play with him, bitch you better off voting for donald trump
i'm yelling mr. kanye west for president
he probably let me get some head inside the residence
i'm in the white house going all out
bumping college dropout, god-bless americans
nothing more influential than rap music
i merge jazz fusion with the trap music
i mix black soul with some rock and roll
they never box me in, i'm david blaine-ing all you hoes
oh yea, let's go there, my dna is dmt, i'm so rare
my juvenile was wilder than the nolia
a locomotive couldn't track me down in my career
runnin' this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, i might demolish
a bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
d-bo, all of it one year, mississippi to california
it gets annoying, niggas wanna deploy him
and bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain't for him
probably thinking it's for him, only one me
swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
mr. valevictorian studied the game before them
listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
to the grave i deport them, corporations extort them
i'm snapping off my endorphins, i alien mighty morphin'
my radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
hundred mil in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
you're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it's important
lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
so pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
jimi kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (ah!)
i tell a bitch don't sweat me (don't sweat me)
i kill this whole fuckin' beat if cole let me (please cole)
ib should've never sent the instrumental
every time i start writing i get sentimental
this shit is just not fair
but why the fuck should i care?
the story of your life here
two young stars was born and y'all gon' die here
oh lord, gotta be the yams

apple jacks, and after that i hit the tv guide
animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
i'm a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
tell a story that i'll never grow to twenty-five
not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria,
and that's a covenant i put on every tribe
ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
nobody gon' abide by (by) your rule
nobody holding your gun, how come, your tongue say killer then kill my mood
light speed living in the world you know
little old me feeling like a live wire
bet i put some new tires on a lightening bolt
'til i wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
i am from the bottom of the jungle
living in the bottom of the food chain
when you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
a new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look alike
hope another homicide don't numb you a nun
do things we'll never learn soon
in the era where we wanna earn soon
that's a error, you can smell it in the air
everybody really doomed
that's why i'm backdooring you motherfuckers

house lick went down perfect
two shots to the head he deserved it
overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
darkwing duck, lost service
mama said i'd better duck, she's nervous
drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
i mean don't intervene with no gun machine
this block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
emerging on everybody corner (dash for it)

crackers gave me ball and chain

state, fed, both can hang
nobody can mute me, but i never said nobody can't shoot me
just another stat to the white folks
still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
everyday feel like the one before
hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
if you do what you always done
then you get what you always got
you dumb buffoons!
i ain't seen the back of my eyelids
for about the past seventy-two hours
hand on my heart, face to the hood
i pledge every word you ever heard was honest
yeah this me, no mic
no cameras, no lights, just pain
mama how much trauma can i sustain?
dirty money come with lots of stains
road to riches come with lots of lanes
just another player with lots of game
never had shit got lots to gain
just another player with lots of game...
never had shit got lots to gain

just another player with lots of game...
never had shit got lots to gain

<i>[hook]</i>
when the sun fall out the sky
all i have is me in the land of do or die
a freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
now, thatâs the ultimate high
to the cloud i go, cloud i go
one time, baby tell me ya need me
cloud i go, cloud i go
two time, baby tell me ya love me

<i>[verse one:]</i>
cause iâve been drinking too much, thinking too much
we ainât been keeping in touch
fell into lust, where is the love?
my independency got tendencies of lack of trust
i look at the street corners as my new woman
seductive as you wanna be, hands on my new garments
and luckily, being in denial ainât the case
cause i know sheâs unfaithful
instead iâm grabbing her waist
and every part of her is tasteful
i know youâre feelings hating
fact, you think iâm ungrateful, i know
selfish as i wanna be and every time you under me
i get the vibe you might need some time to grow

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse two]</i>
cause i been dreaming too much, thinking too much
we ainât been keeping in touch
and every time that i think of your touch
adrenaline pump, give me that rush
iâm gone like a thief inside the wind
lord forgive me for my sins
i know she want me more, but i fiend for benjamins
she said i found the root of all evil, and lost a friend
lost in the world of a young boy from compton
that never knew love because love was never promised
i know, selfish as i wanna be
and every time iâm under you, me too
need time to grow

<i>[hook]</i>


his eyes bloodshot red
i watched him as he took a fifth of henny to the head in memory of his brother
reminiscing on them playing sega with each other
he was hurting, i could see it, plenty tears, no kleenex
i stood by his side because that was my homie
gave him a hug, some of his brother blood got on me
clenching his fists on some angry shit
stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hanging with
i wasn't sure so i gave him no answer
but i was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
revenge, what do say to a good friend
that just lost it and grabbing choppers out the closet?
i tried my best to make him renege, but he was like my nig'
this feeling is more than personal
i stood down, he hopped in a hour-door honda accord
before he bent the block he said k. dot, you wouldn't understand

<i>[chorus]</i>
these streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
not by choice, but forced to be a menace
can someone just pray for me, or war
(or at least, try to understand) the city pressure
the ak-forty-seven, twin mac-elevens
the desert eagle, shotty and the smith &amp; wessons
pray for me, or war

corners become monuments for the dead
candles on the pavement, postcard read
rest in peace, the yellow tape blocking off the streets
a baby momma yelling at the police
but you don't understand, you figure that we're just a bunch of niggas
but the picture is a story untold
see this wasn't in our plans
babies from the late eighties wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way
put that malcolm x book down, then raised that k
complete chaos when we off x pills and st. ides
look the devil in the face from a saint eye
cast a 'spell' on you like akeelah and the bee
every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted, mind
substance, time is no longer an issue
we don't have it, so pass the tissue
then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can
then tell her you understand, but you don't understand

<i>[chorus]</i>
these streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
not by choice, but forced to be a menace
can someone just pray for me, or war
(and hopefully you'll understand) the city pressure
the ak-forty-seven, twin mac-elevens
the desert eagle, shotty and the smith &amp; wessons
pray for me, or war

he came back fifteen minutes later
he said, dot i went on one, do me this favor
dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you
this is critical as it gets my nigga, i need you
i said alright, so what happened? seen a few niggas slipping
and i just started clapping, i didn't care who i was hitting
that's wild shit, but anyway, i got you
i love you my nigga, make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
i woke up the next morning with a cold
allergies got me sneezing and wiping my nose when it was leaking
checked the medicine cabinet, looking for some dayquil
but all i seem was some aspirins, just my luck
i got up, went to rite aid
hoping that the pharmacy department had the right aid, i bought it and left
walked to the parking lot, that's when i seen the faces of death
said they was looking for my man with a chopper in their hand
praying that it would jam, but you don't understand

<i>[chorus]</i>
these streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
not by choice, but forced to be a menace
can someone just pray for me, or war
(now tell me, do you understand?) the city pressure
the ak-forty-seven, twin mac-elevens (huh?)
the desert eagle, shotty and the smith &amp; wessons (do you understand?)
pray for me, or war

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
it's like, it's a revolving door
that i've been a part of my whole life
fucked up right?

when i listen i want to close my eyes and feel your lips
let your lyrics wrap/rap around me and grab my hips
so enticing, on point like the helmet of a viking
kicking up dust like i'm hiking
i ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
i be calling my woman so i can get some
she fresh off work and lord knows it was hard
she take off her shirt and lord knows that i'm hard
composing myself, tryna remain content
she had a long day and plus i know she want to vent
now she can talk about her boss and i can give advice
or she can take the panties off and i can eat the pie
fuck that, option number deuce
on the kitchen table while i play this tune, you know why?

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
look, we be in the car bumping my latest jam
i recorded at the studio around ten p.m.
it's a club banger, catchy hooks and eight hundred and eights
i even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
the first eight bars she loving the track
even rewinding it back soon as the beat drop
the way she react, she like that's hot
till i start talking how many hoes i got
how many i've fucked, how many i've misled
just to get a nut like a squirrel in pursuit of lunch, uh
though i'm on some cliche rapper shit
i know she thinking all my lyrics, they're accurate
she so cool though
don't downplay it just to fuck up the mood yo
she will still play it even though i sound rude yo
and disregards to them provocative records, one thing that i do know

<i>[chorus three: kendrick lamar (ab-soul)]</i>
this something that my girlfriend will like
i ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
i'm playing something that my girlfriend will like
ne-ma-ne-ma-ne-ma-nem <i>[laughter]</i>
told you that my girlfriend would like...
... other hoes tonight
'soul! (this shit my girlfriend will like too, haha)
(kendrick, i got you)

<i>[ab-soul]</i>
this a great idea
this will be girlfriend joint right here
so i'ma kick the shit she like, it seem right
like a pair of jeans that fit tight around her cute booty
i like to hold her from behind in line
at the movies, her body-language gets read
like a ruby, cause she a work of art
no help from julie, i'm a beast and she's such a beauty
i love her, she know that, i place no one above her
far from a narc but best under cover
kodak moment every time we in sync
like an ipod plugged to a usb
it's just you and me, i mean me and her
i mean her and i, it's plain to see, affirmative
so if you ever need me, you know where herbert is
on her mind like she on mine, uh
play some shit that my girlfriend will like
cause i ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
she do music too, this shit my girlfriend would write
if she was me talking bout her, dj...

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
play some shit that my girlfriend will like
i ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
i wrote some shit that my girlfriend would like
now i'm sure to get some cutty


and this is for the homies
i'm talking bout the swap meets, rollie
chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
baby tell the truth, yeah you know we...

somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, i'm tryna get blown
i'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my cadillac brown
looking for e.t. to phone home
tadow, the flavor i kick reminisce the good days
thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the rollie chains
pro club t-shirts, whiter than anglo-saxons
make it a onex-tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
that's fashion if you come where i'm from
compton california, one love to the murder capital under the sun
young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
but i don't trip, i still dip like salsa to a chip
rolling down rosecrans to scoop up my man, a-mack
he talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
and so i scooped him round three:thirty, telling me it's all good
tiger woods, now we looking for the birdy birdies
stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
pulled up on the breezies, well what do you know? i think they love us

<i>[hook:]</i>
and this is for the homies
i'm talking bout the swap meets, rollie
chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
and if you feel good (hey)
raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)
represent the city like you know you should (hey)
i want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
(is that right? is that right?) we got it going on
(is that right? is that right?) we got it going on
(is that right? is that right?) we got it going on
(is that right? is that right?) we got it going on

as i continue my day, quite copacetic
headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell
had the right grub, i bail, need some gas
arco station on avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
we used to stand in line for jordans, excited we got 'em
rocking platinum fubu jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
throwback jerseys, chamberlain and james worthy was two of my favorites
i might pull out the green larry bird on special occasions
but anyway i'm steady coasting, smoking on that hiroshima
ashtray got a million roaches, i'm focussed but feeling good
the homies hanging on <i>[?]</i> and monte carlos
impalas and tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty
i'm grabbing the city like i'm supposed to
making my presence felt like christmas day, what can i say?
every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a g
if you can't relate then please have a seat

<i>[hook]</i>

so, wherever you located, won't you let it be known
and put on for the soil of which you was grown
i put on like brand new chuck taylors
while giving you cuts like fresh tapers
i'm such a fool with it, go nuts
you bullshitting like tuck, the bounce then untuck
the bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
take 'em to school i must, this for the cool in us
this ain't for you, so what?!

<i>[hook]</i>


yea. how i sound out there ali? good? then good.
can i pay my past a visit?
so tell me your compton school district
and video campus shut the fuck up your premises
kendrew<i>[?]</i> and westchester had the baddest bitches
and my nigga l wood got the white toyota,and we got pulled over,
had to hide the bottle because there was mix with hennessy and soda
every time we rode up we was unsober,
and everybody had know that,
my nigga yan yan had all the red p hat
which was really dumb because where we was at
was the other side and more than likely
the other side really didn't like that
didn't have no barrels so if those chopper beam, never really could shoot back
could of lost our life for hood rats
we was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we lucky enough
that the black car didn't pull up and ask where yall niggas from
i know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with they enemies bitch
she had a fat ass and a brown camaro but it wasn't that fast it was like a vsix
but anyways she was one of those hoes in highschool with the cornrows
size five<i>[?]</i> jordans, rolex ward<i>[?]</i> and wanna fight everybody she knows
well she's important well she wasn't she was just so and so,
so and so cousin he was so red
so anytime she got into it, that who she would get,
now let me get back to the plan,
homie had ask do ya got a man
she said no, he said oh yeah,
where do you stay, she said rosecrans
rosecrans and what? she said don't matter just know i fuck
he said what? your a, your a little freaky bitch huh?
she said yeah baby i can you get you sprung,
i can work that pussy and the tongue,
if you come over i can make you come,
if you come over make sure that you bring drink
because i like to get to drunk
and that he did that friday he was where she lived
notice that he was out of bounds
but didn't give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
walked in the house rubber on, panties down oldies playing in the back ground
lets get it on marvin gaye had bumped to the morning,
time to go, picked his place up off the floor
kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
when he walked out he seen a four four bluh!
didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with
and that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
get your ass killed bitch! how?
fucking with them hoes, them hoes,them hoes, them hoes,
them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes,
them hoes hoes that have you uh dead dead dead
look. i guess we can all learn from mistakes
but your first mistake might be your death date
and death doesn't wait, on no one
a million ways to die and you can make it a million and one
if you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes
like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
he wasn't thirteen he was twenty two
when he went to first get put on the hood
he wasn't born it, boys in the hood the movie let him think it was all good
but usually this type of person want to prove his s s s s self on purpose
tell everybody he quit working but really he's worthless
his momma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money
the og's had gave him a pistol today<i>[?]</i> there's going to be just another crash dummy
and the funny thing about it, he thought was about it like pnilla<i>[?]</i>
but he wasn't no killa
just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas,
everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy,
like where are you from?
with his gun but didn't shoot it rule number one
never pull out if you don't use it
even (little dude then banged<i>[?]</i>) the very next day he seen roll down the way blew his
brains out while homeboy was cruising
not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit
and that's how we got his ass killed bitch!
that's how we got his ass killed bitch!
that's how we got his ass killed bitch!
fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! how?
not knowing the g codes the codes the codes
the g codes the codes the codes
the g codes if you don't know then your already dead dead dead
<i>[laugh]</i> feel me?


when i jumped off the porch, i was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
and, of course, when that took it's course, i was hoarse from yelling out
demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
the killers on sight of me, privacy obviously was lost
and the fraud piracy of the streets in my odyssey caught
a bullet that probably destroyed
a good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
i walked down the street with no heat
and run into beef when i'm just a vegan
reekin' the scent of a saint, sinner smell it then start squeezing
pellets that's tumblin' straight at my melon, apparent reason
probably was because of my cousin causing the blood
that was bloodin' in public and kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
but you ain't no kin to me, 'stead of kendrick, i'm kennedy
assassinate my character, sure that's your remedy
fair enough, i got enemies but i don't bang
but that's the repercussions like when your cousin is causing the blood
then you're by yourself at the compton parade, he said:

aye, look, homie, i gang-bang (pump, pump)
a gang member, i'm active, i do my thing (pump)
i do my stuff (pump)
i'm really from the sect, tho (pump, pump)
and if you is or ain't, i still need to know

where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay

i seen 'em from afar then i seen a piece of my jaw
like on the ground, you know the sound when you hear the people in awe
sympathetic 'cause they like seeing you tryna fight back at a pack of piranhas
i promised three of 'em, beat the black off my back in pyjamas, was almost needed
i should've went to sleep and seen some sheep when i greeted the pavement
got up and seen the shock on their faces like "damn it, he made it"
my luck in the palm of a cherry bomb and they waitin' to blow up on me, my homies are not alarmed
then i heard someone's firearm make a sound like it waved around my direction
i'm guessing this is the part where my heart expected to drop in a second, look at the faults
i'm made in the shortest amount of time and in back of my mind i'm like "this the loss i'ma take"
my fate was distraught, a cape and some superpowers can't save me
i'm probably pushing up daisies before i can make my way to the car
cross cancel and right before i seen the black glove raisin' the handle, he said:

aye, look, homie, i gang-bang (pump, pump)
a gang member, i'm active, i do my thing (pump)
i do my stuff (pump)
i'm really from the sect, tho (pump, pump)
and if you is or ain't, i still need to know

where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay

bitch, i'm bustin' back
i'ma borrow my uncle's strap in a minute
jump in a civic then wear that bitch on my lap
i was timid but now i'm tempted
and tenants alert me on where you at
i'm a menace when i'm offended
relentless, i will react
then somebody said the dispatch
of an officer, got his mind made on off'n ya
that's a fact when you're black and undeveloped
you're profiled as a felon
i'm bellin' down boulevards with my basketball and a backpack
gym shoes and my nap sack
hair nappy, my ball cap backwards
and then i look back, strobe lights on my tail pipe
turned left then i turned right
turned deaf 'cause the sirens is loud as the colors of pink and yellow on wesley snipes
pray to god i don't get sniped
pray to god that the sunlight stay shining for thirty more minutes
hope that a witness around when i'm 'bout to cut off the engine
vengeance of hatred is what i'm facin'
even though being a criminal ain't my memo
but this is what he said when i dropped the window:

aye, look, homie, i gang-bang
by the time you hear the next shot, you'll learn that l.a.p.d. is the biggest gang (pump)
i do my stuff (pump)
i'm really from the sect, tho (pump, pump)
and if you is or ain't, i still need to know

where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay


<i>[kendrick lamar:]</i>
it was i witnessing poverty
burning bullets allowing these walls breaking
devour these laws trying to empower me
i thought i knew the reason you grew to love sour diesel
smoking like locomotive your focus was hourly
and then you caught me your pity party <i>[?]</i> me
shower me with the will that never dried
i tell you put your worries and friendly doubts to the side
i doubt that you listen, itâs stuck in your system i tried
sheâs been miserable, sheâs been living in prison
soaking up lifeâs reality this is the visual
baby daddy a light build blade walking with highheel
paid stalking that avenue, never knew how the light feel, i
got a plane got a plan for ya
i just just might hold a couple bands for ya
and leave this message in the sand for ya
tell me youâre ready to change
she said naw nigga itâs part of the game
just like heroin

september twenty-twond, two thousand and nine
kendrick lamar, to... to...

let me start off this letter saying i don't like you
scared of you, but i will fight you
i stare at the ceiling and think about you
curiosity killing me, thinking of when i'ma meet you
you introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers
children and babies, drive me crazy, i wonder
why you love people that love people that do right?
is it rocket science to you, or is it just your type?
one of my biggest fears
is waking up four in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
or maybe a person that i'll never meet cause of you
you, son of a bitch, and i wish you never existed
and i swear i'd blow your brains out if you paid me a visit
but that's not realistic, cause you'll never write
but i'ma still send this letter off, p.o. box
and when you get it

<i>[chorus]</i>
please take it personal
please take it personal
please take it personal
because it's personal

let me continue this letter saying i don't like you
i'm scared of you, but i will fight you
should be ashamed of the moves you make
the pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break
every day you remind me that you're always there
cause every time i come around, someone's getting shot down
and all i say is a prayer, so help me lord
then the lord talk back, i can't help you boy
that's fucked up, my luck's fucked, was cursed before birth
and what's fucked up, i gotta live my life with the hurt
of knowing that you're everlasting, dwelling upon the masses
of the earth, fatal assassins snatch your bodies
probably, on my notepad as i write
why the fuck you wanna take my life?
sooner or later, i'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
so when i write on this paper, it's real talk, so

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar as 'death' (screwed vocals)]</i>
let me start off this letter saying i don't like you too
and the reason why we haven't met because i've been busy dude
but ever since grade school i watched your every move
you slipped up a few times
i gave you a pass, so don't say i ain't sympathetic
but you can bet it, your curiosity, i'ma dead it
everybody wanna know why i act this way
let's just say, i had a bad day
matter of fact everyday, gotta take it out on somebody
and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
i was born to be a killjoy, i'm a old brat
conceived by adam and eve, so who you mad at?
not me, see me, i'm just doing my job
and you ducking me is mos def an odd
so why send this letter as if i never knew you?
i'd rather knock on your door and just give it to you

<i>[ab-soul talking]</i>
it's everywhere, the streets, the corners
the coroners, the morgues
cemeteries, hospitals
heard about 'em when i was little
tomorrow's not promised
cause any day he can be knocking at your front door
war, genocide, homicide
suicide, all coincide
signed and sealed by the living
make it, don't take it

<i>[chorus]</i>


i can tell you what it is, i can tell you what it isn't
no more k. dot, my mother had named me kendrick
fuck a stage name, that's the name that i was given
the only thing that i can identify within this bidness
i'm just a good kid from compton that want to rap
weighing my options, pick up a bible or a strap?
i never killed a man, never sold any crack
all i ever did was try to keep my city on the map
but this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to win
i'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends
so just to get a dollar, will i sell my soul?
i look the devil in the eye and tell him, hell no
they say anything worth having is worth the wait
well i want the world, tell me how long that takes
there's no time like now, i can cut my patience/patients short
or give 'em some more gowns, i don't even want the crown
i just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when i get it
you won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own bidness?
a rich nigga buy anything you sell him
a broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
well i'm a broke nigga
but still i wouldn't listen to you even if your hand was on a bible quote, nigga
pfttuh

see i was brought up different
whatever that my pops said, for sure i'd listen
you said you did dirt, but i can't dig it
it don't concern you if you wasn't born in it
oh-no-oh-oh
i swear we got to fast-forward...

before time flies by
my new sound for 'zero-ten is, why lie?
and if you ain't trying to win, then why try?
now you can low-ball or give me high five
this is i nigga, look into my eye
nigga, i am kendrick... lamar
nigga, my name is kendrick... lamar
i said my name is kendrick... lamar
i changed the name cause i was tired of being like y'all
now finally i'm ready to tell the world who i are, pfttuh

and that used to be a hell of a task
now i'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass
my character like it don't carry a
confidence that can marry a halle berry or angelina with no cash
i'm bout to cash in my thoughts
give you a compass, then tell you get lost
what i'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom
once the 'eves' come, they quick to stare 'adam'/at him
hoping i don't take they bitch, but i'm on some other shit
when i'm done, i'm tryna run the government
they are big dreams
transition from a rapper to a human being, you can't 'school' a dean
i be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience
all cause they all oversaw it, my god
y'all be out partying, i be stealing your audience
all because who i are, lamar

but my first name, it gotta be kendrick... lamar
nigga, my name is kendrick... lamar
i changed the name cause i was tired of being like y'all
now finally i'm ready to tell the world who i are, now let's go
but we can't go... backwards


these streets is jurassic, cowards get asthmatic
astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere, that the ghetto burb
pull up on the curb (what's up homie!), smoke a nigga then dip
it's the immaculate, verbal assassin, strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
this is jesus of nazareth
spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
in a cherry low-low with four zones of weed, no sticks no seeds
prestigious when i post safe through fifty states, beneath the speed
can corral the largest crowds, mosh pit with a big dick
screaming bitches ain't shit, she gobble gobble for hours i jumped in the shower
i dismantle, devour, hardest emcees softer than clam chowder
no challengers can compete, they're childish and weak, detrimental
hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with god and frankenstein
i'm kurupted!

i'm kurupted!

gimme a hundred g's for every emcee i drop to their knees
verbically useless, oh you got the juice? i'll squeeze you juiceless
catch you, hang you from many nooses
been the truth since, snoop and the pound was fuckin' over ruthless
young and i'm ruthless, twenty-one with twenty-one guns, shottys thats looted from pac, lyrical cyclops
lazer-in on paper and fraudulent friends, bitch yous a bitch in disguise and bitches get ten
bullets to their midsection, mr. lethal injection in a regal higher than church steeples, i swear to god
count your lyrics in a jar, i'mma pterodactyl tearin' ya squad, like pardon me in terrance martin in aston martin
cannibal co-existing with the coldest, that means i'm the sickest, and theraflu won't do
whenever i'm kicking the wickedness, explosive, syntagmatic, smokin' like the barrel of this tech aimin' at ya' neck
i'm kurupted!

i'm kurupted!

(look homie) i'm from c-o-mp-to-any nigga can get it, the little homie strapped and he with it
at the avalanche swap-meet (what's up fool!)
blunt longer than rose grants, i'll grab the devil then slow dance
practice trigonometry, practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches, you are counterfeit
worthless beats and verses surfaced. west coast with a big scope kill all y'all it's top dawg, tde, cpt
quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick a.s.a.p
complete havoc, compulsive disorder, rhyme addict -- slaughter
house is full of joey, joells and royces for ya'
live from the area code of three-one-oh, laughin' all the way to the bank with three elmos
three six-fo's, one bottle of goose, i'm the truth, you could put your hand on the bible and shoot
i'm kurupted!

see a lot of y'all get real disrespectful, real comfortable, not recognizin' ya' legends
west coast legends, young gotti

i black out like howard university when i verbally turn into hercules hurtin' these emcees early and urgently urkin' my nerves searching for certain certified nouns and verbs on the verge of vigorous victory. kurupted


<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
uh, yeah <i>[coughs]</i>
kendrick lamar, uh

yeah i can reconcile being depressed real bad
i'm a thinker, not a drinker, but still i hennessy drag
alcohol numbs the pain like when novocaine stabs
in your arteries, pardon me but my city go mad
via compton california, corners with coroners and karma on 'em
colors corresponding to gangs upon us
common corrupted crip and pirus cripple the city
triple the crime, bible nor the qur'an can save
welcome, don't be afraid, your city similar right?
where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five?
i'm twenty-two, at twenty i knew i was against the odds
this kid named jonathan was monitoring
his momma and sister, his older cousin, he honored him
anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
to johnny, he might have been a modern day rider then
he walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
pull out a mac-eleven, now his eyes is big
fascinated by mayhem, what's his cousin to say now?
he wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one
more gangster under the family tree, took 'em under his (wings) like kfc
crip crazy, rocking matching t-shirts that says "the hood made me"
no love, just spread slugs, that's the policy, the leader and the prodigy
now shorty doo-wop, holding a oowop, hanging with rah-rahs
with blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades and licks
going on missions with lunatics, a ninth-grade menace
thugging for six months, smoking like six blunts an hour
the power of banging, he was walking from... <i>[gunshots]</i>
little johnny

<i>[outro: malcolm x (kendrick lamar)]</i>
"i think you'll find, sir, that there will come a time
when black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
and this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
and then at that point you'll have a situation
where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
and this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
and this type of thinking also will bring an end
to the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people)
and it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
no federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
it's something that the black man has to bring an end to"


wow, i think y'all must have forgot or something
like i ain't hot or something
like i don't make your girl take off her top or something

<i>[chorus one]</i>
i'm like, ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, l-m-a-o
ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, l-m-a-o
laughing at haters in here
i be her favorite in here
she want to play-play
what more can i say-say?

but, mm, jumped in the coupe and i'm gone
i smell like money, i don't need no cologne
i just need me a freak that can jump on the bone
like an x-ray technician, my rectangular prism
says money, sex, then drugs, all cause i'm twenty-one
like playing blackjack, picture this kodak
moment forever, k. dot that dude
she sucked my dick and got frostbite, i'm that cool

<i>[chorus two]</i>
i got a pocket full of checks, plus i'm bouncing through the club
with a crazy two-step and diamonds on my neck
ziploc fresh, ziploc fresh
and hoes want to play-play
what more can i say-say?
but ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, l-m-a-o
ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, l-m-a-o
laughing at haters in here
i be her favorite in here
she want to play-play
what more can i say-say?

yeeeaah, bottle of goose and i'm gone
watching her get loose like a third grader's tooth
the shit that we on is the ultimate high
'xxl' flow, that's the ultimate 'vibe'
park that lambi outside just to fuck with the haters
put the lambi in drive, watch it peel like potatoes
holler l-m-a-o with a drunken two-step
like i never could pass a sobriety test

<i>[chorus two]</i>

yeeeah, i'm in the club acting mannish
<i>[?]</i> lenses, make my view panoramic
i'm out of this world, i'm off of this planet
they don't say k. dot is here, they say his spaceship has landed
and your access has been granted/granite, like a kitchen floor
but my kitchen's marble, i ride in the carpool
because i got two whores in the back of that roam
see they're all i need, like a layup from a loan

<i>[chorus two]</i>


uh, shoutout to schoolboy q
he uglier than a motherfucker <i>[laughs]</i>

tire marks, tire marks, finish line with the tire marks
when the relay starts i'm a runaway slave, uhh
walking on water and running on waves, god mc
oh my god you gotta see, there's never no is in me
of an odyssey, i'm a block away
fire marshals moving in, marshmallows inside my pen
sweet sixteens, got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
i'm so appalled, with a prototype with a guy named protocol
you an amateur, they want a pro' to call
i'll damage on camera in compton, in canada, i don't care where ya are
just blink twice and i'm there where ya are
like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
in an ocean full of sharks, bout to come up short
water in the pot, throw crack rock
like bam bam nigga, have two grams nigga
pay up or blam blam nigga, have the black cam'
we can go dipset, (killa cam) nigga
i've been around niggas, killers, pimps
you ain't been around shit but your momma and your bitch
jumped off the porch when i was like six
uncle bobby got the house raided back in 'nine-six
kick in the do'
canines was all in the kitchen way before i even heard of mike vick
momma in the bathroom, poppa at work
happened on a sunday, we should have went to church
look at my shirt, polo on it
it's gon' sell if my logo on it

cause i'm going out with a fist raised
and a fistful of money, give it to the fifth grade
drink a fifth of hennessy and then take another fade
with a democratic politician from c.a.
they don't wanna see a b-l-a-c-k
making some scratch like a hall of fame dj
give us some free js, put us in the pjs
now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
goddamn, your call

i had to fight back and shit, get it back and shit
and you rap niggas looking funny
tryna talk back and shit, like he back that shit
acting like you real or something

i'm being myself, my b-f-f is a b-m-w
with your b-m in it and a stash box glove
and the medicine the doctor gave a nigga won't help
i'm at a limit where i be amazing myself
i bet i finish on a level with a black belt
i'm better anywhere, every rapper get killed
like bla-bla-bla-bla! where the knife at?

the nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh
i ain't afraid to say i need you, ah yeah (hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
i promise i'd never leave you, ah yeah
my life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes

the poltergeist that scare emcees
my prototype for every
my share of d's and r.i.p
she know my type of style is like my everything
apparently, my appetite stay famished
bite no hand that feed
the culture vulture die and bleed
my focus hold these thoughts and dreams
control this pen (look over your shoulder)
boldest lines in rhymes and things
devote my time and mind it seems
supposed to shine, remind i'm king
provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
the pro's the con's, the diamond rings
the forward time, but i'ma bring
the soul divine and cross between
what's your's and mine's, the gold, the green
the roads that show just what it mean
that grabbed shakur and by the wing
and fly before my vocal scream!

one of the kings of black history
and yes, i see the game is a little different
niggas lack simply
and bars and i spit 'em like darts
'til they puncture your kidney
you trash and it don't matter how much you gon' try to convince me
and you gon' make my gun cock until your hole night away
yeah, ohh

so pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when i shake 'em
so rude, i'm so ice cold but i'm what you need to just wake 'em
while 'em crowns and medals on the wall waitin' for me to just take 'em
when i arrive, my theme music, gotta pound to it
and when i leave, even my shadow got a sound to it
'cause i'm the god, the harder, the martyr, the father
i spit the saliva, that's leaking the lava
completin' the saga while meetin' and greetin'
and beating you niggas completed-ly
conquer, extremely bark on a nigga

graffiti your arm up, you heebee, you jeebee
but, kenny, you brought up (you give me pity)
now give me the startup
you treat me, you greet me, you meet me with arms up
so sweet when i spit
heaven's deep, it was deep
i was sleep, now the guard's up, hmm
upholding the fundamentals
while most of you boast the rental
focus on what's most essential
spit bars to provoke your mental

while i clap these raps like thunders
look over your shoulder boy and wonder

more ridiculous than white cleopatra
or caucasians telling blacks to go back to africa
but i digress, you're more, but you act less
why do you act less?
even still, when the weight of life feels like a boulder
(just look over your shoulders)

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
mic check, ali
the mic don't sound right

<i>[chorus one: kendrick lamar]</i>
even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot (ali, get it right)
even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
uhh, tell 'em i got plenty arson to sell 'em
heat by the fleet, displaying it very seldom-
ly, i write till i ignite my cerebellum
close to the (pen) like i had three felons
come from a city where niggas show no remorse
and a corpse is just another homi' taking it's course
of course my dream was to play in the final four
till twelfth grade came and i was only five-four
so now i'm a graduate looking to get hired
my pops knew a security job, he inquired
but ignorance is bliss, that's what i was told
i stopped, dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
now there goes another black boy unemployed
with a lot of free time, which means he's vulnerable
to run into a lot of crime, i wrote it in my rhymes
and when i left the porch this is what i realised

<i>[chorus two: kendrick lamar (uncredited female)]</i>
even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot {yeah, yeah, yeah}
even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot {yeah, yeah, yeah, so what's up?}
(these streets ain't none to play with
it could get outrageous
got burners, .forty-fives and gauges
that could really get outrageous)

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
so i'm thinking to myself, what's next?
my security job only got me like two checks
my pops disappointed, told me i'm fucking up
irresponsible and i needed some growing up
i told him i would go back, knowing i wouldn't go back
working a nine-to-five is something i couldn't stomach
surrounded by the violence, all the goons and the goblins
with ninety-nine problems i still kept it one-hundred
these streets can be rather manipulating
especially when you're black and just turned eighteen
so what's a kid to do, when you're fresh out of school
and the negatives of the world constantly following you?
not to mention a local henchman, compton sheriffs all like terrorists
osama with badges that talk arrogant
that boy fifteen fifteen and he holding a .forty-five
thirty years apart, thirty years before he realised

<i>[chorus two]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
uhh, soon as the beat drop
i bet some heat pop, on a block close to you
like a relative, you sipping belvedere
while these niggas planning to rob mr. belvedere, yeah
i'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as martin luther
but it seems like all my friends eventually become shooters
and niggas banking on you is something that you'll get used to
you can either fight back or run home and grab your ruger
whatever you do, just make sure that you willing to do it
being too indecisive can get you killed inside your buick
cause you stopped at the light, five minutes from midnight
with no tinted windows, that nigga surely had shot through it
you tell me you listening, but you don't hear the music
call you billy hoyle when turmoil was near
this is the realest right here, when i lost my very first job
my pops said "why?", i said i couldn't aim for the sky
cause even shooters can get shot, get shot

<i>[uncredited female]</i>
these streets ain't none to play with
it could get outrageous
got burners, .forty-fives and gauges
that could really get outrageous


you can own this city
you have everything you need
all it takes is all you got
life don't ask you if you're ready or not
you can own this city
deep inside you hold the key
while the world is fast asleep
you can take it all if you just dare to dream

talk about goals
talk about a pen and a pad and the pad of your house
with a permanent flow
hennessy on the floor looking at a video on the couch
and the couch is cold
and the pouch in your mama pocket got a permanent hole
and your brother pout 'cause he want food on the stove
and a pedestal with a silver spoon, and a big pool
with a big room and a closet, cause it
hurt when you laughing at his clothes
looking at him like he ain't shit
forever living in that commode
time flies and i watch it tick
look in the mirror and i gotta take risk
like blood on the sheet of a suicide note
tripod then i aim it at your soul
for bright lights
bite like a alligator when i write
hungry, come see determination upon me
come see the visionary in my sight
my life premeditated by ambition
pistons from my nikes take off
no assistance, i'm persistent
adolf wouldn't look at you with this thought

you can own this city
you have everything you need
all it takes is all you got
life don't ask you if you're ready or not
you can own this city
deep inside you hold the key
while the world is fast asleep
you can take it all if you just dare to dream

let's talk about pressure
let's talk about depression
let's talk about desperate
times
everyday i'm guessin'
my mind, i never end up resting
i climb a ladder every second
i find another mountain top
another video i watch when a video go off
i jot like edgar allen, matter fact a thousand
soldiers never could war off my talents
i wanna reassure my talents
i wipe my face but never throw my towel in
i'm often prowlin'
the edge of a quantum jump in my head
i'm a monster from anywhere but earth
and i'm one of one ever since my birth, i came for some bright lights
bite like a bear trap when i write
hungry, gotta chip on my shoulder
i took it off and ate it
i made it a full meal
and i'm still craving, my front teeth
i sink in the rap game
my name will attract fame
my veins got the blood of a king in it
when it pours down, now snoop's on stage and he say
"kendrick"

you can own this city
you have everything you need
all it takes is all you got
life don't ask you if you're ready or not
you can own this city
deep inside you hold the key
while the world is fast asleep
you can take it all if you just dare to dream

so what you gonna do?
what you gonna do?
you can run, you can hide
but when you are chosen
the walls they close in
your forefathers look you in your eyes
so what you gonna do?
what you gonna do?
you can run, you can hide
but when you are chosen
the walls they close in
your forefathers look you in your eyes

you can own this city
you have everything you need
all it takes is all you got
life don't ask you if you're ready or not
you can own this city
deep inside you hold the key
while the world is fast asleep
you can take it all if you just dare to dream


rare breed, kendrick lamar
breed up or speed up
breed up or speed up
breed up or speed up

this is for my niggas that be all blacked out
hit the streets a hundred deep, what rare breed about?
riding hard, bending corners, the girlies on us
leave a hater scarred, big dressers sit at the stop light
road glides and road kings deep in my hindsight
you do it right or don't do it at all
put that candy paint on it, ride them twenty-threes homie
custom seats, custom brakes, hit the streets and ball
centre of attention like bynum and gasol, aw
you know that killer californication
when you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling, chasing
dreams, hoping this conglomerate can run the nation
it's abomination how we bomb yo' block
i'm talking big punch, k-dub, baby slip billy
bad azz, rare breed, we all we got
see 'em out, show 'em love, chunk the deuce, give it up
it's a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard, nope

<i>[chorus]</i>
pounding on the highway stretch
all blacked out, making sure we on deck
might catch us on them dressers or them road glides, yes
tell the world i'm a rare breed baby
breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
breed up or speed up, i'm a rare breed baby

and it's like that to the death though
two-oh-point and seeing decimals, i ain't lying
pounding on the interstate in the state that shines
or we might be in a hood near you
around the globe baby, rare breed under control baby
them pipes loud, the movement entice crowds
we heat it up in the cold baby
it's three degrees out? then you should see me out
or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow
ha-ha, we be the father of harley drivers, so don't bother
show you infants how to whip it, have a bye-bye
posers try to hang? then we hang 'em by the collar
silk, lannie, rare breed family
stunting hard like a black circus, voila
breed up or speed up, get ahead
so with that said, bye-bye

<i>[chorus xtwo]</i>

shouting out the one and only rare breed
now breed up!


<i>[intro]</i>
"this, this, this should be played at high volume
preferably in a residential"

<i>[chorus one]</i>
life's a bitch, life's a bitch
but i'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
i'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
i'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
i'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
my dick hard, her pussy wet

and i'm born with my dick in the earth, you can tell me how much am i worth?
i'ma die with my heart on my sleeve, many die on their hands and their knees
and i'm taking whatever i need, and i'm raping the government fees
and you're wasting your time, and i'm speaking my mind on whatever i think
and i think that i'm richard pryor with priors of thirty-two fiends
and that means that i here fly higher, tell me why are you staring at me?
matter of fact man, your eyes is wired, you inspired by kendrick the king
maybe it's cause i'm living my dream, man i sing what i'm living about
in the words that come out of my mouth, they requires a random routine
of being organic granite, then my access is granted
to represent the shit that i conceive, and i guarantee that i'ma bring
my mind, body and soul, and i sold all these records off being myself
and i wish you can do the same thing, man it's easier than a stripper
or tying a baby shoestring, you stringing along
and really, why you writing a song? your passion for music is never in sync
no secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
and they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit? you can believe

<i>[chorus two]</i>
i'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
i'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
my dick hard, her pussy wet
i'ma keep the pussy wet, yep
(hi hoe) i came, (bye hoe) i went
(hi hoe) i came, (bye hoe) i went
(hi hoe) i came, (bye hoe) i went
bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch... 

and i see that you envy of me, enemy ghosts don't prosper
better yet, they do die eventually, if i'm at the event you will leave
cause you know and i know that i go +h.a.m.+ even if muslims is seen
in my rearview i'm near you, but i don't hear you, can you hear this breathe?
with an oxygen mask, and the masses keep saying i'm speaking for them
and if you can imagine my madness, then you can see where i've been
and the places the louis has been, and i swear i've been doing this when
you was in pajamas watching b-b-barney and-and friends
and you couldn't harm me even with ten weapons of your choice riding in
army tanks, you shot blanks and i shot back, made your duplex bend
what the fuck you think? if i don't think then i'm right back where the city sin
what the fuck you drink? thinking i can't write these raps in the lions' den
when i hear that you lying then, it's murder she wrote, ain't no hope
you go downhill man, where's your slope? get thrown downhill tied to a rope
tell the world to put intervals, man i swear this the antidote
and they tell me that life is a bitch, who gives a shit when you know that

<i>[chorus two]</i>

and i see that you envy of me
don't prosper, better yet, they do die eventually
cause you know and i know that i go (h.a.m.) even if muslims is seen
in my rearview i'm near you
hi hoe, bye hoe...

<i>[fades out]</i>


<i>[verse one: lloyd]</i>
i'm way past gone, and i just see the bottom of this bottle
i just woke up to a room full of models
who know that i ain't calling them tomorrow
it's been so long, since i have been on this level right here
waking up, after i pass out, i put my clothes on, before i mash out
cause i've been loosing my mind, wasting my time
fucking these hoes and sipping this wine
skipping the line to get in aside
playing the part and feeling them lies
shawty says she need a ride
i tell her cool and get ready to slide
next in my room, i hit her from behind
doing and doing like i'm pressing rewind

<i>[hook:]</i>
pour up, drank, head shot, drank
sit down, drank, stand up, drank
pass out, drank, wake up, drank
faded, drank, faded, drank

<i>[verse two: kendrick lamar]</i>
now i done grew up
round some people living their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask
back stroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feels
some people wanna kill their sorrows
some people wanna fit in with the popular
that was my problem
i was in the dark room
loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
that i'm a get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
i see the crowd mood
changing by the minute and the record on repeat
took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me:

<i>[hook:]</i>
pour up, drank, head shot, drank
sit down, drank, stand up, drank
pass out, drank, wake up, drank
faded, drank, faded, drank

<i>[verse three: kendrick lamar]</i>
okay, now open your mind up and listen to me, kendrick
i'm your conscience, if you do not hear me
then you will be history, kendrick
i know that you're nauseous right now
and i'm hopin' to lead you to victory, kendrick
if i take another one down
i'm a drown in some poison abusin' my limit
i think that i'm feelin' the vibe
i see the love in her eyes, i see the feelin'
the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
this how you capitalize
this is parental advice
then apparently, i'm over influenced by what you are doin'
i thought i was doin' the most then someone said to me

<i>[hook:]</i>
pour up, drank, head shot, drank
sit down, drank, stand up, drank
pass out, drank, wake up, drank
faded, drank, faded, drank

<i>[bridge:]</i>
i ride, you ride, bang

don't tell a lie on me
i won't tell the truth 'bout you
don't tell a lie on me
i won't tell the truth 'bout you

thirty millions later, my future favors
the legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
travel round the atlas in this spaceship candy-coated
my day shift's been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
pi equals three.fourteen
the devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
wait up
lampin' in jamaica, the cloud's turnin', my thought's turnin'
burnin' castor oil, i been determined to make an earnin'
this seed in this soil is classified
i'm satisfied when i strategize my kid's future
i ain't sanctified enough to say that i won't shoot ya
i done vandalized the industry full circuit
the earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
scum of a land that transcends two surfaces
the richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
the more blood pours, but...

don't tell a lie on me
i won't tell the truth 'bout you
don't tell a lie on me
i won't tell the truth 'bout you

oh you don't wanna clash? nigga, i know

hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, i'm on a roll
yellin', "one, two, three, four, five
i am the greatest rapper alive"
so damn great motherfucker i've died
what you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
house on the hill, house on the beach nigga (facts)
a condo in compton, i'm still in reach nigga (facts)
i'm fresh out the water i'm 'bout to breach nigga
the five foot giant woke up out of his sleep nigga
oh yeah, oh yeah, more cars, more leers
more bars, no peers, no scars, no fear, fuck y'all, sincere
i heard the whispers, i curved the whispers, you know what the risk is
earth indigenous, ya body reverting to stiffness
the whole world goin' mad
bodies is adding up, market's about to crash
niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
donald trump is a chump, know how we feel, punk
tell 'em that god comin'
and russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
electorial votes look like memorial votes
but america's truth ain't ignorin' the votes

you know compton, nigga
just a lil' compton nigga, uh, uh
kendrick lamar, uh
yo, uh

back with a vengeance
back with my heart and i'm venting
back with another war pendant, salute me or shoot me
i never wore a kufi, ignored my religion
i believe there's one god, there's one love
and i believe if i fly, we all doves
i make a way for my people to see the light
brighter than yellow bones, me and my microphone could be one
until i see big, 'pac, see pun, but this ain't (eazy)
i can't take a (big l), my city needs me
i gotta win, the proof is in the pudding
and i've been fucking with cosby since i was ten, you damn right
any means necessary, get the campaign right
very emotional, i'm a gemini
i love hard and i fight harder, a born author
a born starter, in the game for real
and the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
you can't learn if mistakes ain't made
you gotta pay homage in order to get paid
you gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
and you ain't getting it till you start paying jewels
lifestyles of the young and the broke
with my hand under oath, i recite these quotes
and if i ever lied then i'd die where i stand
as a pest, not a man, with a roach and a rat
in order to see the front, had to play the back
we played our position, we let y'all play yourself
y'all made your decision, we pray while we prey on competition
to flip another page of corinthians
i see stars when i write these sentences
words crash cars when i write these sentences
open jail bars for my niggas' life sentences
free j-dub, kill all witnesses
y'all better hope two thousand and twelve really real
cause the way i feel, i'ma make y'all suffer
and take y'all supper
i haven't ate in the last twenty-two summers and i'm twenty-two now
it's about to go down, so un-god my god
we got this art, it's ours in awe
oh, i'm free
finally, i can say i'm me
the kendrick lamar ep a classic ep
the question concerned
i dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
hope y'all infected, hope y'all ain't have no protection
still i'm progressing, room for improvement
make room for the groom married to his music
i was at the xxl just trying to excel
networking, meanwhile my stomach turning
wanted to be a part of it, catering to my audience
j. cole running late, if he don't show up
think i can take his place? ladies start laughing
no pun intended, i ain't being sarcastic
homie popped up with about twenty bags and
fresh off the plane, i couldn't even complain
my nigga was on his hustle, i introduced him my name
said i'll see him on the bubble in the future
my dude i salute ya, contributing to real shit
talk about it, make the people talk about it, make the world see
for every emcee that i see tryna steal flow
tell 'em build a boat like nore
and take 'em to a place that i'm sure we all can blow up, boom
i ain't a star yet but i'm getting close to 'em
and if you see a wack artist, do more than boo him
throw him off the banister, shoot him on camera
then kill his manager, than hang a banner up
that reads you can't proceed without being conceived
by one album of the nineties
on rosecrans where you'll find me
and all my niggas is grimy, but i remain the good kid
tryna make a difference where i'm from, where you live
oh no, we've got to slow the city down
i told the homeboy pump his brakes
he said that he'd rather put the pump to his face
sawed off, torture
turn the saw off, scorching
hot where i'm from, the newscasters don't come
another ratchet got dumped, in the trash can
i ain't done, a baby in there with it
she said postpartum did it
molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
when he was undressing, said he'll only be a minute
that's why a nigga always kicking something with some feeling
i should have been a dentist, i should have been a blizzard, cold
flash, pose, flash, pose
a critic paparazzi got me on my toes
i wanna jump on 'em like a tadpole
tadpole, assholes
tryna kill my dreams, not elevate?
those are not my dreams, i'll be straight
with a little bit of passion
and a (drive) like an aston
motivation from nipsey or glasses, jay rock
mykestro, bad lucc, u-n-i
dom kennedy, murs and fashawn
lady g, willie b, in time
i'ma (blow) like a motherfucker sniffing lines
go like i've never seen a red light shine
flow till my heart hit the flo' when i'm dying
heart of a lion, tell 'em get in line
and pass the baton, i won't pass it back
i ain't good at dimes
if the bitch bad i could pass you a dime
haters better duck like i'm passing a pine
know i'm the king and i'm passing you pawns
pad of the hill, that's a passion of mine
promise i shine
like two mics under heavy strobe lights
i'ma need to mics just to get my point across
i'ma get my joint across, country y'all gon' want me!


<i>[intro: kendrick lamar]</i>
one two, one two, one two
one two, one two, one two
one two
turn the headphones up ali
one two
you mix with dre, right?
turn the headphones up

<i>[verse one: kendrick lamar]</i>
when the whole world see you as pac reincarnated
thatâs enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
find the tallest building in vegas and jump off it
but i could never rewrite history in a coffin
so iâm talking to god, âcan you wash all these demons off me?â
this last year iâve been quite similar to aaliyah
control my own destiny, only rapper that steered
a gfive, gâs give high-fives to me and say, âkendrick, just persevere.â
the presents of being rare
as i lay in this four corner room staring at candles
thinking, âhow can i make an example, for this generation of compton?â
my biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
or turning back to that same accomplice
my past life was a child with no act right
trying to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
assuring that some blossom early and some truant
thank god for the album i idolized
itâs dark and plus hell is hot, thatâs the start of this crazy ride
two young niggas, me and dave inside the garage
and thought we was jay and dame
thats the lane that we tried to drive
truthfully, i just started rappinâ to get away
i never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
my nigga got hit twenty-five times with a k
make the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse
now punch is my mentor, top dawg is the coach
jay rock is my older brother, i was there when he wrote
his name on his record deal, we had figured the coast
would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store
find ourselves scrambling, tryna figure it out
soul told me that the record shop âbout to go in a drought
q ainât got a place to stay, and âbout to sleep on the couch
we eating off each other tray, the dollar menu amount
meanwhile the coast going hard at each other
the younger rappers had wanted some of the ogsâ comfort
but i ainât need it
i never screamed out the ânew westâ, i didnât believe it
they brought each other down, i was planning out my achievements
i need to separate myself to stand out
i need a better way to take your fans now
i need to kill you motherfuckers dead
three hollow tips aimed at your head
iâll be damned if the chopper jam now
and we never asked for no hand out
in the midst of it all i recall a called when you said how
we could never resolve in the hall of fame
and iâm with the trial with a bible and a rifle
i play the game as i plan blow
hollaback at me, nigga
and if they said iâm the one, why you asking me, nigga?
cause when the whole world see you as pac reincarnated
thatâs enough pressure to make you just open the book of david
and pray to god hat make it or live your life in the matrix
cause falling off is a sickness, i heard that itâs quite contagious
i need to separate myself to stand out
i need a better way to take your fans now
i need to kill you motherfuckers dead
three hollow tips aimed at your head

<i>[verse two: ab-soul]</i>
iâll be damned if the chopper jam now
and we never asked for no hand out
iâll take you back to that pack of black &amp; milds in my hand now
in the midst of it all was cooking with pots and pans out
looking forward as four of us are forced to form a new clan now
fast forward as i wait in line for this passport
the homies was still poor, was working at jansport

<i>[verse three: kendrick lamar]</i>
whoever thought that rosenberg would mention me to dre?
even vanessa from xxl had told him to press play
and there goes my fate, now iâm on stage with snoop
gave me the torch and i ran with it in high pursuit
rapped with my forefathers, even record with gaga too
lyricist of the year, fuck am i supposed to do? rock

<i>[verse four: jay rock]</i>
laughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes
exaggerated shit that we had rapped had came true
thought i was aggravated, when warner had let me loose
i was honest, see they was haunted when mike jones didnât recoup

<i>[verse five: kendrick lamar]</i>
cool, cause niggas wonât outdo us in the booth
even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof
i came, i saw, i conquered
no shame, i blame all of this on compton
thinking about when sherane tried to set me up
cold game, full circle, they set up her
i put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs
the fight to ignite any wrong or right that i prolong
the story was short film, the glory of him and them
the worry of mother who donât recover when baby killed
the trial and tribulations, the newer miseducation
the view of body wasting, you knew somebody who didnât make it
the angry, the adolescent, the reason i ask this question
will you let hip-hop die on october twenty-twond?
will you let hip-hop die on october twenty-twond?


<i>[intro:]</i>
praise to the almighty, hiiipower
me and my niggas (live forever)
three eyes to my alumni
feel this
i wanna hear it, turn me up (my niggas on point, game tight)
turn me up a little bit more nigga (my niggas on point, game tight)
my nigga cole in this motherfucker. wassup nigga?
(my niggas on point, game tight)
there we go yeah, turn me up

<i>[verse one: kendrick lamar]</i>
picture plenty pussies throwing pelly guns at me
paranoia making it more than difficult for me to sleep
pinnacle, i know i be, centerfold, i know i got
but they hate to frame me as the mona lisa of hip-hop
so retaliation is a must, when we bend the block
my niggas dump'n out the roof, (do-do-do-do-do)
drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
me, k-d-o-t, put tnt inside my suit
walk inside the label, struck a match, and then i blew, bomb
cfour everywhere, cfour everywhere
i got three hoes with me, it smell like dior and derriã¨re
decoy dodge slow, you can detour to heaven's stair
so walk inside hell's dungeons, i just might derail something
they pussies, i smell something
you douche on the daily niggas, you pushin' em daisies
i push on gas on the mercedes, nigga
came in this game with a rolie chain and a dream
became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream

<i>[hook xtwo: kendrick lamar]</i>
and now we dump'n out the roof, (do-do-do-do-do)
drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
me, k-d-o-t, put t-n-t inside my suit
walk inside the label, struck a match at then i blew

<i>[verse two: kendrick lamar]</i>
niggas that thought that good kid gon' flop, or i might go pop
or your bitch won't drop, knees when my shit drop
you're too infatuated with the fucking numbers
which make it easy for me to divide and conquer
i come from compton, we ain't have it all
smoke a space inside the cafeteria hall
and i'm putting fear in you all
see your skeletons shaking
jump out your body, you ricky bobby until you naked
y'all pray to god this week i be putting out bombs
i pray to god this beat is good enough for shyne
if not j. cole, your shit is trash
but at least my opinion just made everyone laugh
this is where we at? i guess it's entertainment
i guess this is speculation making a classic came with
if i ain't have the patience i'd probably self destruct
real people want real music, the jig is up

<i>[hook xseven: in the background]</i>
my niggas won't put guns up

<i>[bridge: kendrick lamar &amp; j. cole]</i>
your worst fear is confirmed
we love that you crashed and burned
the real is back
k. dot it's your turn, take your victory lap
king cole salutin' compton's own king kendrick
that's the sky is falling, the wind is calling
stand for something or die in the morning
the city hail king kendrick lamar
the world hail king kendrick lamar

<i>[hook xtwo: kendrick lamar]</i>

<i>[outro: kendrick lamar]</i>
this is my life and i look at it like it's my last
and i'm lookin' right past the future as i reminisce on my past
and i don't even think how i used to, my mind is on rocket blast
and i don't even drink like i used too, and i don't even smoke
so you know this natural flow is for users since they want to go to rehab
lookin' at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them
then but i won't say my bad, see i just lay in the cut
watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what
see now we dump'n out the roof


oh, lord, oh, lord
pretty ass girl over there, come play on ma nappy hair! <i>[*laughs*]</i>
drizzy drake, here we go, look

bitch, i'm gettin' it how i live, i put that on my left rib
twenty-five with no kids but this dick you can babysit
twenty-four lighters in the sky, what life is a real nigga
twenty al-qaeda bomb when i do sight 'fore i kill niggas
passion my preference, benjamin franklin my medicine
the mvp let him in, i'ma fuck up his letterman jackets with pendants on them
and i got plenty war story, politic never depended on 'em
uncle sam never did shit for me, momma made miracles
choppers drove me hysterical, cartoons and cereal
pyramids on imburial, that's the projects
and i make that progress from a tedious process
i'm a problem better yet a prospect, fuck that i'm a loch ness monster
conqueror, compton, hail king k-dot, aka <i>[?]</i>, compensate for shooting for the stars muhafucka, click, brrt

shooting up the charts, muhfucka
see, a rich <i>[?]</i> could buy anything that you sell 'em
a broke nigga believe anything that you tell 'em
i let smokers pump my gas, but i do that very seldom
drop your ass at the unemployment, the only way i help 'em
they call me a role model, i'm still a baby myself
hungover from last night, got us speaking till school at twelve
hennessy with the sprite got me bouncing like rumplestiltskin
they caught me rummaging through women, i'm laughing like elliott wilson <i>[*elliott wilson's laugh*]</i>
pay me respect and pay me on my checks
my first fifty thousand collected paid off some street debts
you know killers that looked out for me back when i was hungry
we go back like reebok classics and black and blue <i>[?]</i>
i got a genuine clean slate, never you ask for my fucking weight
never i'm handing out favors, bitch, every show now is two hundredk
as i write down my new bucket list, i can look down on your fucking hate
get the fuck up when i'm in your presence, you listen when i fucking say
"what the fuck you niggas want from me? the only nigga that i owe is god!
huh? huh? drizzy
what the fuck these niggas want from me? the only nigga that i owe is god!"


reporting live, compton california
the good kid

i'm tired of doing it
the same way, gotta flip it before i ruin it
make it all make sense 'fore you put your two in it
opinions get thrown out the window with ron browz
so turn me up loud so the world can hear
and when your favorite rapper rapping you should cover your ears
and go death, go death i said
go death and stay dead, a shot to the forehead to kill 'em
but i ain't here for no ignorance
i'm militant as martin luther king and a penalty
aiming for my dreams till a bullet bounce off
one of my deep thoughts and hit a nigga in the spleen
i've got in it my genes, you probably think i'm talking bout a pistol
but i'm talking bout the blood of a warrior
my nigga, what you worry for? i ain't tryna jock your swag
i'm tryna better my craft and stay relevant, yeah

<i>[chorus]</i>
as time flies, hope that i'm soaring
far from the boring, i'ma
tell you why, it's important
i'm not the boring, i'ma
if i think and act like you do
the world will die from not seeing something new
and if i don't speak on how i feel
the world will lose out on what's really real
and if i should die before i wake
i pray my music could take my place
in the world... the relevant

i'd rather you call me that
than a typical artist you call wack
on a youtube blog holding ars and stacks
of ones, but never could be the one
to rally communities or lead a crowd of blacks
passion is too strong, i'm pissed off
so there's a chance you get pissed on, r. kelly was in the wrong
but that don't make you an exempt
that don't make you a no-go from hitting the fence
you ain't a blood and damn sure you ain't a crip
the crowd yell "hoe" but i ain't a pimp
i'm me, i'm free as a five-finger discount
see you on the flip side right after i dismount
if i ever feel like i ain't pushing myself
i'll find a cliff, then push myself off the edge
like a barber at the tip of your head
that's how i settle it, life or death if i ain't relevant, nigga

<i>[chorus]</i>

so feel free to not mind me
if you're used to boosters, drug dealers and shooters on wax
cause most of y'all niggas fabricate facts anyway
i could easily cheat and let the four-four play like a two-on-two orgy
but i've been there and it bores me
got to the point where it did nothing for me
at forty i want to afford not to record bullshit in my story
and i'm mad young, so i'd rather do it now before my career's done
this is pain plus glory, victory is here
if i cried, you could see strength and pride in my tears
i do it for the kids
i do it for the twenty-three hour lockdowns doing time in the pen
and my pen is the only thing i got for hip hop to change the game
and they'll remember my name as the relevant

<i>[chorus]</i>


so i met this young lady, ya know, when i went back home. i was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. i said "you know what, girl? you crazy." then she asked me what he said

(what did the asian say?)
a peace of mind
that's what the asian said, i need a divine
intervention was his religion and now it's a prize
him believing in buddha, me believing in god
asked me what am i doing, he said "taking my time"
meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
see you thinking too much plus you too full of yourself
worried about your career, ever think of your health?
(what did the indian say?)
a piece of land
that's what the indian said, i needed demand
telling me longevity is in the dirt, buy some property first
profit a better dollar with generational perks
equity at his best, really, you should invest
these tangible things expire, don't you expect
income with so much outcome and yes
look at my heritage, we blessed
(now what the black man say?)
a piece of nookie
that's what the black man said, i needed to push me
to the limit, satisfy my hunger
do it all for a woman, hair cut to a wool
we like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
what you saying to me?
he said "homie, come back to reality for a week"
nookie is power, cut on a new chick every night
i wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
(what the white man say?)
a piece of mines
that's what the white man wanted when i rhyme
telling me that he selling me just for $ten.ninety-nine
i go platinum from rapping, i do the company fine
what if i compromise? he said it don't even matter
make a million or more, you living better than average
you losing your core following, gaining it all
put a price on my talent, i hit the bank and withdraw
hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
put myself in the rocket ship and i shot for the stars
tell me what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
i'mma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
your profession anonymous as an artist
i don't target your market
you ain't signing your signature when i throw you my wallet
a lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
world tour, your masters, mortgage, i need ya

i holler, "what you do? what you say?"
i shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if i get freed today

what the black man say?
tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
tell 'em we don't die, we multiply


two tears in the bucket i cry with you
but i could never lie with you
i could never afford not to afford
i could never put my plans to the side with you
i could never see a red light
like a deer with a headlight
i freeze up when i re-up
see i rarely have patience
and you're relating
only the moment to complete us
why you hate to work for it?
the reason why i hate to wait for it?
see a nine to five was so jive turkey
but when thanksgiving came that check didnât hurt me
you plead the fifth
i read the fifth amendment
we both criminals with bad intentions
they say time heals all
but if i could shortcut
my success, corvettes by tomorrow

but why you so sad?
walking around with them blue faces
they say iâm down on my luck
and itâs something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money, and itâs breaking me down to the top

my home girl got a credit card scam
she got a scholarship to college but she donât give a damn
intuition got a black woman wishin'
she sayin' this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
i know you, woman, i console you, woman
you feel like the universe owes you, woman
oh the anticipation, hoping you could make it
women don't prosper chasing education
but you're talented, and can't handle it
and your homegirls can't be your manager
three hundred and sixty-five times four, plus more
can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
but ain't no money like fast money
even today i'm considered a crash dummy
a rapper chasing stardom, how can i fast forward?
my accolades better than all them

but why i'm so sad?
walking around with them blue faces
they say iâm down on my luck
and itâs something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money, and itâs breaking me down to the top

i love god, i love speed, i love drank, i love me
i love oceans in the deep
i love women, i love me
i love god
but iâm scared of god speed
sometimes

wrote this song looking at a broke home maybe
you know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and baby
somebody say "kendrick american, they shoâ is crazy"
and i said âwhy?â
then he looked me in the eye
he said homie you messed up
you breaking my good luck
you wishing for miracles
living through shit, youâre crying hysterical
settle for everything, complain about everything
say your soul crack, my world amphetamines
you projects ainât it, i live in a hut
you living to keep warm
iâm living to pay rent
i paid my way through
praying to allah
you played your way through dealing with wi-fi
go ish yourself, you talking to strangers
same thing go for the ones you came with
we all came on the boat looking for hope
and all you can say is that youâre looking for dope
these days ainât no compromise
your pain ainât mine half the time
a brand new excuse ainât nothing to me
see i made my moves, with shackled feet

cape town, cape town, cape town, cape town
cape town, cape town, cape town

cornrow kenny
all morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr
morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr, skrr
cornrow kenny
so many plays on me i finesse
palisade views with some sex
i lost a lot of love for missionary
this the first time i react
me and top is like a kobe and phil
a father figure play with him, you get killed
play with me and he will kill you himself
tde the mafia of the west
move in silence, yeah, we jugginâ like that
act of violence, yeah, we jugginâ like that
i did a lot of dumb things in my past
love will give me hope and i wonât relapse
dave just bought a new nine eleven
almost thought iâd seen another plane crash
q just bought a brand new mclaren
rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
moosa got his son dripping in gold
me? i'm about to let my hair down on hoes
ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
top billing thatâs a million a show
might blow the whole remy on soul
might tell obama be more like punch
sounwave got a grammy this year
mack wop, bet he do what he want

level two, level two
no iâm not done
you ainât gotta tell me that iâm the one
i could put a rapper on life support
guarantee something that none of you want
then hold me down and they yell something like
rent is like twenty five hundred a month
what if i empty my bank out and stunt?
what if i empty my bank out and stunt?
you ainât gotta tell me that iâm the one
you ainât gotta tell me that iâm the one
you ainât gotta tell me that iâm the one
you ainât got, you ainât got
you ainât got, you ainât got
tell me that, tell me that
that, i am the one
you ainât got, you ainât got
you ainât got
you ainât got tell me that, what iâm the one
yes, iâm the one


<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
i swear you people don't know kendrick, you don't know him
but you say you want some more kendrick, i'm bout to show 'em
everything inside this human being, i'm still growing
i'm a premature, baby in this crazy life that we adore
doors on the lamborghini, i want 'em
can't afford 'em so i tell the swap meet to clone 'em
i guess i really am a vanity slave
i guess my ancestors turning in they graves
burning money when i get it, fuck a life savings
overdraft bank statements just to make a statement
when i put this fashion on, i'm a fashion junkie
picking cotton in the country, i bought this out the country
whips and chains, whips and chains, jacob know my name
he call me kunta, you my brother, we come from the same
modern world, that's your girl? i see she rocking fendi
try this on, if it ain't upscale then you may offend me
copping everything in sight, ignoring they sacrifice
amnesia if i see the black visa in my hand tonight
i show my dick and then i swipe, that's a punchline
they was hot and i wore ice, that's ironic huh?

<i>[kendrick lamar]</i>
aw man, videos got me wanting hoes
appetite for flashing lights, all i can do is pose
a black male, on melrose
i should get blackmailed, buy my people hell rose
niggas that ain't had shit for four-hundred years
overcompensate by over-accessorising with gear
many of y'all don't see my vision
i do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches
am i a hypocrite cause everyday i'm contradicting?
i think of how i'm living, then i watch "how i'm livin'"
i know this can't be right, my conscience tell me to stay righteous
it's unlikely to see what i like and say i don't like it
biggest dilemma, my priorities ignoring me
i wanna move accordingly, but baby steps are premature remember?
i'm flying to the south and i'll be gone till november
to see my family tree, but this a shame i'm yelling out timber

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[kendrick lamar (gucci mane)]</i>
cold, oh so cold
how ironic? he bought it, then sold his soul
is it masonic for your vice to take it's toll?
the remote control is taking control
lift up the doors
that lamborghini i wanted come with a dumb-ass model that in vogues
i like 'em both, i'll wife 'em both
take these motherfucking jordans off, put on my loafs
cause nothing goes bad every time i wear (gucci!)
i'm getting more ass every time i wear (gucci!)
they tell me it's a fad every time i wear (gucci!)
but should i give a fuck when it bring me more coochie?
this a young nigga's pedigree, i pray the lord can better me
if not he bout to strike me down like this my third felony
them voices keep on telling me, kendrick don't forget about us
i burned my wardrobe, hoping that i could live without it

<i>[chorus]</i>


uh, yeah
ha-ha-ha, ha, uh

i said chilling in my tipi, no indian but he be
the realest shit, i must admit, i'm basking in my feces
my style is harder, yours is watered down, fiji
the bible or my cd? both of them are said to be the
formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
no time to play kid, i think you needs to chill
houseparty with killers, pray for it to defill us
where exes think it's buffy, and chandeliers hang from ceilings
i'm dreaming, i'm scheming to be major
composer like i'm mozart, the sequel to amadeus
today is, the day i see the sun, ignoring all the rain
the fat lady has sung, actors' highest claims
paper by the forest tree, acres of the thc
i don't smoke with homies though, find a cloud then have a seat
wonder how meyer lansky live to see eighty
i just wanna see mercedes give me head in mercedes
'knahmean?

and guess what?
i need all of mine'sâmo' paper, mo' dough
i need all of mine'sâmore pussy, more hoes
i-i need all of mine'sâand yeah, publishing, can't forget publishing
nigga

just ride, don't ask where we going (ay)
journey through the sky, cloud nine, no bowing (ay)
baby take your time, i'ma keep it in control and
give you what you need and give you what you want in life

i need all of mine's
i need all of mine's
i-i need all of mine's
just ride, don't ask where we going
journey through the sky, cloud nine, no bowing
baby take your time, i'ma keep it in control
give you what you need and give you what you want in life


<i>[verse one]</i>
look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
i never felt the feeling of euphoria
pain forever, prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
wake up in the morning and i gotta win
not taking the victory, thatâs my only sin
and so i send a message to your messenger
a warning shot to let em know iâm serious
iâm ready for a war
when i roar it can break a glass window
the only thing for sure is the perfect way
to bend you on your back
even if i gotta slither through the cracks
i can crack every code you deliver i attack
every hole with a bomb squad sittinâ on the tripod
even if he try hard, he can still die hard
run but you canât hide
white flags, you can pull âem out fast
and tell me your last goodbye

<i>[chorus]</i>
i will, i will, climb the highest mountain
before the flood comes
and all my fight is drowning in blood
what i gotta lose? what i gotta prove?
i guess, war is my love

<i>[verse two]</i>
make sure your next move is slick
your best move is nothing
you know i take risk, dark clouds, i love it
cause i can hide in the mist
hop out and crushinâ every soldier youâre with
so iâm six for six
iâm sick with determination, iâll terminate ya quick
i lead the pack, i follow no rules, i see the traps
i know youâre close to fallinâ on your face
unload, reload, hand me another case
explode, explode
the fire of my eyes
is waiting on your demise
i know you hope your help is close by

<i>[chorus]</i>
i will, i will, climb the highest mountain
before the flood comes
and all my fight is drowning in blood
what i gotta lose? what i gotta prove?
i guess, war is my love
war is my love
i guess, war is my love


<i>[verse one: kendrick lamar]</i>
i woke up this morning with my dick on hard
didnât know why tilâ i said fuck all yâall
or fuck this world, or iâma fuck that girl
good kid, m.a.a.d city watch my day unfurl
i put my life in these sentences
fucking right itâs either that or life sentences
iâm relatives with benjamin
i used to give a fuck about my luck when i was innocent
now what the fuck is up iâm at your neck like a pendleton
nigga i need thought bitch i need thought
twenty-four acres and a mule best believe that
they say he got smoked like where the weed at
and everything you hope bitch nigga we that
pockets on kelly price back when it was âninety-five
buy a strap and then we cock it back when itâs uncircumcised
write a rap on how we just react when shot and hit the spine

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse two: young jeezy]</i>

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[bridge]</i>
all praise go to the most high
all phase turn into a drive-by
part ways from the streets, after fucking with the police guaranteed
last nigga did that died, donât you, donât you, donât you
wanna live with the ak, go for only eightk
minus six racks, minus one on top of that
maylay, snub him out then drag him out mouth like he date raped
daytonas bending every corner while they say

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse three]</i>
all i ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
and my teachers asked my woman, when she smiled i stick my tongue in
plus some cartoons and some cereal
snoop doggy on my stereo
some british nights or la kids when glowing nights
or perry ellis jacket, i would love a swapmeet full of
chevrolets and candy paint, thatâs wet with tammy on the bumper
can i hump her? poppa tell me yes
ebgc concert and a dj quik on cassette
twenty years later, hi hater, iâm the fucking best

<i>[hook]</i>


i return before tables get turned
it's my turn, spur of the moment
they reproduce my sperm and try to clone it
stand firm, bumping the the firm 'phone tap', i'm on it
i slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent
you can't fuck with the horse power, you're woofing too much
you're bout to go hoarse coward as soon as i buss, pause
you put your hands on a broad, then telling me you can brawl
you thought you saw me when you saw 'saw', frightening
more reckless than a paisa driving without license
hitting your new truck, then leaving you hiking
they said no, the industry let it go
i cracked the window, they hit the back door like trick dices
sticking and moving, and moving and sticking the prices
upping the ante before i'm an antique
i promise you'll hear me clear, even if you need three ears with tyson
gripping the panties, big booty, no whammies, they dyking
i'm liking them all, i'm sifting through panties, haters will spike it
voicing opinions, but holding laryngitis
but i don't hear 'em, i'm a winner by law
track 'em down like a subway when they sub-par
sub-zero every time i jump in the synagogue
send an angel, send a god, i don't make it look hard, i know
i just let the thoughts take its toll
more 'sentences' than level iv yard
bogard, go hard, black tar, concrete
tom vick, times papi mason, times three
uncle toms need toms to stomach atomic bombs, or die from my wizardry
rza, gza, method man, i'm a 'killa bee'
killer be killed, make your embassy yield
this is not your cup of tea, and oh
they say waters run deep
dive in bermuda triangles and you'll see us
we must, dust behind, emcee's duck
deduct, revenue decline when we touch-
down like a running back's grind, can you keep up?
you keep a safe for keep-safe? that ain't safe, bla!

aw, yeah (it's like this, like this)
it's eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
(till forever, till forever)
one time for your motherfucking mind, we represent the three hundred and thirteen
you know what i'm saying?
yo they don't know shit about this
for the 'ninety-six

ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
to get your brain relaxing, the zany-acting maniac in action
a brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
you look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
my rhyming skills got you climbing hills
i travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
i'm sliming grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
and twist the necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke
this is the season for noise pollution contamination
examination of more car tunes than animation
my lamination of narration
hits a snare and bass in a track for duck rapper interrogation
when i declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring gazing
i turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
i'm infinite

you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
now i'm trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
i'm infinite

bust it, i let the beat commence so i can beat the sense in your elite defense
i got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
i greet the gents and ladies, i spoil loyal fans
i foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
one thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep full of people
mcs are feeble, i came to 'cause some pandemonium
battle a band of phony mcs and stand the lonely one
imitator, intimidator, stimulator, simulator of data, eliminator
there's never been a greater since the burial of jesus
fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
my thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
my a cappella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
that eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
with entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
now i'm trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
i'm infinite

man i got evidence i'm never dense and i been clever ever since
my residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the m-o
so i'm assuming all responsibility
'cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill mcs
mic nestler, slamming like a wrestler
here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
no one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
i get cynical act a fool then i send a crew back to school
i never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
i'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
in fact i can't see, or can't imagine
a man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
so this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
plus the man who never had a plan b
be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit
i'm tensed a bit and tempted when i see the sins my friends commit...
i'm infinite

you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
now i'm trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
i'm infinite
you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
now i'm trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
i'm infinite

'ninety-five, 'ninety-six ('ninety-six)
and on and on and on (and on and on)


<i>[old school hip-hop beat tune plays in the background like a radio station]</i>

yeah soul intent, checking it number one baby this week

this is mc proof

<i>[head]</i>
and dj head

<i>[proof]</i>
checkin' in on w.e.g.o.
you know what i'm sayin'?
ay yo we got the number one requested song, of the day coming up next.
it's a local thing wants retilin'
it goes by the name of eminem
and it's called "it's ok"


<i>[eye-kyu:]</i> check it out, 
<i>[eminem:]</i> hey kyu!

<i>[eye-kyu:]</i>
<i>[verse one: eminem]</i>
one day i plan to be a family man happily married
i wanna grow to be so old that i have to be carried
till i'm glad to be buried 
and leave this crazy world
and have at least a half a million for my baby girl
it may be early to be planning this stuff
cause i'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
cause man it's been rough, but still i manage enough
i've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
my hands have been cuffed
but i don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
i'm anteing up double or nothing, i've been trouble enough
and i'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
my destiny's to rest at ease, till i'm impressed and pleased
with my progress, i won't settle for less than cheese
i'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
way before my baby is able to crawl
i'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
to know i hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
i seen the golden gates to heaven on earth
where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, q

<i>[eye-kyu:]</i>
<i>[verse two: eminem]</i>
i'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep 
praying for sleep
dreaming with a watering mouth
wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
in this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
with the root of all evil
i've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
and make them do shit illegal
for these grant's and jackson's
these transactions explain a man's actions
but in the mist of this insanity, i found my christianity 
through god and there's a wish he granted me
he showed me how to cope with the stress
and hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
to selling dope with the rest
i quit smoking cess to open my chest
life is stressful inside this cesspool 
trying to wrestle, i almost bust a blood vessel
my little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
he's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
kids attract static, children with automatics
taking target practice on teens for starter jackets
i'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
i won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
it's cumbersome, i'm trying to do well on this earth
but it's been hell on this earth since i fell on this earth

<i>[eye-kyu:]</i>
uh, it's ok, yeah it's alright, even though i can't sleep
uh yeah, it's ok, it's alright, i can't sleep


<i>[eye-kyu:]</i> now what you know about a sweet mc, from the three hundred and thirteen
none of these skills you bout to see come free
so you wanna be a sweet mc, you gotta become me
if you ever wanna be one see

<i>[eminem:]</i> man what you know about a sweet mc, in the three hundred and thirteen
none of these skills you bout to see come free
so you wanna be a sweet mc, you better become me
if you ever wanna be one see

<i>[verse one: eye-kyu]</i>
yo some people say i'm whack, now if that's right 
i'm the freshest whack mc that you ever heard, in your lifetime
my slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
boy i'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
with the mic i'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
i got more different strokes than philip drummound
on open mic i bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
we elevated to new heights premeditated 
let it be that i stated they hate it now that they see that i made it
the escalated can be put to the test of greatness
snatch the heart from mc's and i ate it
so i take it that's the reason i'm hated
to represent my temperment
if rap was a dick all you so called hard mc's would not be impitant
but pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
harder than ll's rock the bells, but you is a ho (now)
everything that you collaborate i lacerate 
my rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
at a faster rate, yeah i got something for your ass to hate
i blasterate, and have you all running master gates
and as for face clutching and touching the flows
i got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
bucking these hoes, i got that shit down to a science
leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
defiance, no we won't have that
you want your shit to blow up?
well i'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
and blast that shit to kingdom come
then bring them some of this real hip-hop 
i drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
and you all knew from meeko
that you couldn't hold your own with the strength of lou forigno
so stop that bullshit and flow
yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know

<i>[eye-kyu:]</i> now what you know about a sweet mc, from the three hundred and thirteen
none of these skills you bout to see come free
so you wanna be the sweet mc, you gotta become me
if you ever wanna be one see

<i>[verse two: eminem]</i>
so what, you know about a sweet mc, in the three hundred and thirteen
you don't know shit so when you see one flee
you can be run-d, you'll never beat the mc
i'll stop the alphabet at s and got it down to a t
i'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet mc crashes the spot
i'll make the roof hot like i was rock master scott
your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
i'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
it's either them or me man, kill or be killed
you will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
my facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
i'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
if he's acting soft and he cowers
he better come cleaner then jay rue jacking off when he showers
you flowers got no clout with a thing
you could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
i shout the slang, simple as a,b,c's
skip over the d's and rock the microphone with e's
dethrone mc's and i'ma max alone
relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
so facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
i rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
i'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
you couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
but you can bring yours let's see what you got
but don't front and never try to be what you're not
cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
and fuck jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack 

<i>[women singing:]</i>
tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

<i>[verse one:]</i>
i'm getting mad love, i'm snuggling hugs
druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
so here's a toast to federal checks
hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
we travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
to find babbling max, gaffling tracks
i grapple an axe for them baffling acts
the mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
still in my yard when i sculpted the culprit
the tall shit that will end up with his skull split
then i buried the hatchet, i carried on my back 
butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it
baby all i wanna do is swallow one and two
smoke a little bit and follow one of you 
back home when the party ends
so tonight i'm dropping naughty hints
to the finest women in the audience

<i>[eminem:]</i> 
cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

<i>[verse two:]</i>
ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandealous
living as scandalous as a television evangelist
but i can handle this, i'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
i think a living never meant for me
experimentally i found a way to spread interamentally
when i stumbled upon this resolution
by using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
you couldn't see me with binoculars
i armed like an octopus
step on stage and you get socked and pushed
talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back
come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
when i rap i represent it and will never referee in it
every minute so when i win it you never resent it
i'm forever demented, come up with funk, i'll never be scented
you got the point when i cleverly said it

<i>[eminem:]</i> 
cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

<i>[verse three:]</i>
eminem is heading skyward
for those who thought that i would make you bored and treat you like a piece 
of plywood
i've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
with the agility to escape a killer bee colony
so get your cameras and capture how miraculous 
i rap for all you draculas and showed you all how whack you was
i meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
i'm hazardous enough already as it is
without you adding fuel to the fire
i'm cruel to the liar
who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire
clinical studies show that i'm cynical
there's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
i'm sure the party people can agree
that i'm enchanting, with the romantic
freaking the vocals so frantically
so throw your hands up in the atmosphere
and let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like

<i>[eminem:]</i> 
cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright


maxine!! (phone rings)

<i>[maxine:]</i> hello
<i>[denaun:]</i> can i speak to maxine?
<i>[maxine:]</i> yeah this is me what's up?
<i>[denaun:]</i> what up?
<i>[maxine:]</i> who dis?
<i>[denaun:]</i> denaun 
<i>[maxine:]</i> yeah what's up?
<i>[denaun:]</i> what are you doing?
<i>[maxine:]</i> nothing, just laying in bed
<i>[denaun:]</i> huh?
<i>[maxine:]</i> nothing, just laying in bed
<i>[denaun:]</i> why?
<i>[maxine:]</i> i don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

<i>[verse one: eminem]</i>
i know this crack fiend maxine who needs a vaccine
she tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
plus she got a sugar daddy
asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
if you mistook her sadly, on her reputation
you're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation
when you step away son, she got her face done
looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if
you press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
if you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
but when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
to go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
don't bring your germs to me, cause i ain't trying to hear it
while your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (maxine!!)

<i>[verse two: denaun porter]</i>
sometimes i wonder, what's your purpose? in life that is
to get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
you living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night
you say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down
and then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this 
mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
you say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
when you got niggas hiding in your closet
i refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely

<i>[verse three: three]</i>
i met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
so i stepped on it and then asked my homies
and chilled on the side and then watched they niggas 
big game over there and take notes, while i get this number
i stepped to her first i cleared my throat and said "hey bitch..
haven't i seen you before?", looked at my nigga
turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
and said "oh it's like that?"
she said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
she started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
she said her name was maxine, so i told her i wanted her number
she asked could i give her mine two
got to the crib and called her up
we got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could i fuck
i said "maxine check this out, 
give me your address i'll be through and you'll find out"
got to the crib she let me in
she didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
i said "hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"
what the fuck are you doing?
so i went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
as she went for my midsection
i threw her down as i tore off her shirt
pulled out my jimmy and i thought about putting in work
before i hit it she said
"three don't get mad but there's something that i gotta tell your ass"
i said "what is it, another nigga? it's ok"
she said "no i forgot to tell you, that i got aids"
i got up out

<i>[denaun:]</i> hey, maxine
<i>[maxine:]</i> what
<i>[denaun:]</i> you thinking about sucking my dick?
<i>[maxine:]</i> yeah for a small price
<i>[denaun:]</i> for a small price? what you mean?
<i>[maxine:]</i> you know, money nigga
<i>[denaun:]</i> you don't need no damn money, 
i can't give you no money anyways, i heard you got some shit.
<i>[maxine:]</i> (laughing) what you, what you hear i got?
<i>[denaun:]</i> aids
<i>[maxine:]</i> (laughing) who told you that bullshit?
<i>[denaun:]</i> my nigga kyu, he wouldn't lie
<i>[maxine:]</i> well if that's the case, kyu got it then
<i>[denaun:]</i> oh for real, it's like that?
<i>[maxine:]</i> (laughing) well i ain't got shit, 
so he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me, 
i ain't fucking around with no threerd nigga
<i>[denaun:]</i> fuck that, i ain't fucking with you
<i>[maxine:]</i> no, see.. 
<i>[denaun:]</i> you got that shit, i ain't gotta fuck with you
<i>[maxine:]</i> hold on, why it ain't even like that
<i>[denaun:]</i> i want ya'll to get paid, fucking..
<i>[maxine:]</i> (laughing as the phone hangs up)

point him out bitch i wanna know
who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) i wanna know, i wanna know

<i>[verse one: eminem]</i>
i'll have you taken back to christ when you sacrifice
the way you acting slice when i tear your back with knifes
jacking life's of mc's, now i'm set to launch a plan
for blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
a stomped your man so unless you want what he got
you better set the mic down, i'm steaming like a teapot
i'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
if i wanna battle, then i chase them in a jason mask
it's an amazing task to battle with success
i never gave a fuck, now i give a fuck less
and in a slug fest i get physical like physicians
invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
when i torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
so feel the force of my spiritual images
slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
my skin itches every time a rapper recites
and when he's through with his verse, i'm all covered in flea bites
you wanna see fights i got a match for you
you couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula

<i>[verse two: eminem]</i>
you bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
you wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
intellectually superior, i'll make the whack wearier
inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria
materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
how much in fear when u hear me you'll be
shiver and shake, quiver and quake
bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache, whither and break
you slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
i'll twist you into a different shape
and toss you in michigan lake, for fisherman sake
if this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
every dis you can take, personal
we ain't friends trying to make amends
if you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence
i make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
your last releases, you bad diseases, that's the reason
i'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
so pass it like a hot potato
i've never been less than clever and fresh
severing flesh of fools who never impressed i can confess

hey what up man?

<i>[verse one:]</i>
cause all i do is yearn a life without a concern
and dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
my desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
cause man i live in the d, this shit ain't given for free
nothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see
i'll be the prisoner to flee, all of this misery
i'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
but just an mc, so listen to me, but if you disagree
you missing the key, you ain't even in the brisk of the tea
unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
my objects were never to swab decks
it's up to you the decision is yours
if what you vision is tours, or a mission less course
when shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star

you know what i'm saying, see what i'm talking about man?

<i>[verse two:]</i>
yo i'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business

financial interest is the matter at hand

the few that i trust, thems the people that i still got
fuck with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot
the five elemantz for life my man thyme
proof, kyu and denaun, we move through into time
my crews true and divine, we never fronted
we just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
it's all about a man planning what his future is
what he can do for his to be a star

that's what i'm talking about, i'm not trying to be the player,
i'm trying to be the man, i'm want to be president

ninety six baby


<i>[women singing:]</i>
ain't no one special, special like you <i>[fourx]</i>
i been searching, but your the one i want in my life baby <i>[fourx]</i>

<i>[verse one: eminem]</i>
i'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
missing what i remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
bugging and weezing, i'm having trouble when breathing
it's even tougher when sleeping
but there's a couple of reasons that i'm suffering and grieving
for loving and leaving, you all i'm thinking of in the evening
you got my knees buckling and weakening
thoughts of nothing but freaking that i'm struggling to keep in
and interrupt when i'm speaking
i got some game that i'm preparing to run
the way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
you got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
cause your comparing to none, i wanna share in the fun
i feel a passionate lust when i'm imagining just us alone at last with a 
touch 
i see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good
the seed is passing in dust
i'm not asking to rush and answer immediately
i just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
if you agree to repeat after me, i love you (i love you baby)
cause i just need you to see, how much i'm eager to be
your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
this is easily said, so you can lead or be led
if you care to be down cause ain't nobody like you no where to be found

<i>[verse two: denaun porter]</i>
baby it's all on you, it's you i call on boo
let's set a day up so you can fall on through
we'll take a spin in a lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
we'll start it out with caviar, don parigne
and then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
we'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
i got the herbs the bacardi and hurricane
if daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
it's still all right cause i got minute maid and tangeray
your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
you look impeccable, nothing compares
i dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so
it seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
when you step away, baby but don't forget the neglicie

<i>[police voice:]</i>
attention all units, attention all units
we have an all points bulletin out on a man with green hair
i repeat, we have an apb on a man with green hair
he's armed with a knife, i repeat, he's armed with a knife
proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
he could be coming at your girlfriend next

<i>[verse one:]</i>
there's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
his face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
he'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
he's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
he's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks

<i>[verse two:]</i>
we got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
locking down every block and put up metal detectors
protectors and be sure that you stand close
watch each others backs and guard your command post
and most of all be advised that he's wise
he could be disguised as one of your very own guys

<i>[verse three:]</i>
i'm on a solo mission to find him personally
to settle the score and beat then him mercifully
for what he first did to me
it's sure to be the last
following footprints with a magnifying glass
to drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
i'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
i heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"give me your girlfriend or i'm gonna kill ya"

<i>[verse four:]</i>
i followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
inside the depths of his basement
i taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
i saw my life flash in front of my eyes
i felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
none of my guys knew where i'm at i was doomed
then i remembered the flashlight in my costume

<i>[verse five:]</i>
dealing with backstabber's there was one thing i learned
they're only powerful when you got your back turned
i yearned for the day that we finally met again
so i can give him a taste of his own medicine
he shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
i took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
beating him over the head with the telephone

<i>[police voice:]</i>
attention all cars, attention all cars
unit three hundred and thirteen has apprehended the suspect
he's going back to the crazy home, i repeat
he's going back to the crazy home, how about that?

<i>[men singing:]</i>
jealous! <i>[eightx]</i>

<i>[girls voice: (talking over the singing)]</i>
jealous!?! what he mean jealous, know what i'm saying?
he just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what i'm saying?
girls don't buy him no clothes, he bought that ho some clothes!!
he don't buy me no clothes, nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
i mean, what do i got to be jealous for?
he ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
he has no career move, i mean...

<i>[verse one:]</i>
i come home every single day from working double shifts
and stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
i come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
it must be only just because you never learned to trust me
plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
to many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
i buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
i bring you diamond rings you say i'm bad at timing things
so what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
you act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
i used to love your company now you always bugging me 
for information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
so i'ma wait for your evacuation
cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
see i've never been so sure, and your just insecure
so my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
i recommend you take your things and check them in
look at the nervous wreck i'm in, i need my second wind, say what?

<i>[women's voice: (talking over singing)]</i>
fuck you and what you going through
fuck eminem, he just mad cause i left that nigga for another man
me and eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
immature, me? nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
know what i'm saying? he just mad cause i'm getting it all night
jealous of me, know what i'm saying? that's what i'm talking about
mother fucker just trying to get his pussy

<i>[verse two:]</i>
i used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
i used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
until the day i started following your feetprints
and tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
it made complete sense, there's someone else you like 
so i confronted you and asked you who was mike?
and you was like, (sampled) **i need a new nigga** 
someone rich that i could follow
and you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
leaving me in sorrow, brandy never felt so broken hearted
i fell apart when you departed then the joking started
i was an open target, you play comedian
and i became the laughing stock. but now i'm on my feet again
and so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
all in my sex life, i got a message from phife
he goes, "you didn't want me to see you then, i don't want you now"
take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down
you run me down and now your trying to apologize
for all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
because i got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
jealousy is in the house ya'll, fellas sing it...

warning, this shit's gon be rated r, restricted
you see this bullet hole in my neck? it's self inflicted
doctor slapped my momma, "bitch you got a sick kid"
arrested, molested myself and got convicted
wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
i'm dr. hyde and mr. jekyll, disrespectful
hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
"murder murder redrum"
brain size of a bread crumb
which drug will i end up dead from
inebriated, till my stress is eleviated
"how in the fuck can eminem and shady be related?"
illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter
bitch getter, hid in the bush like margot kidder
jumped out (ahhhh!) killed the bitch and did her
use to let the babysitter suck my dick when i was little'er
smoke a blunt while i'm titty fuckin bette midler
sniper, waiting on your roof like the fiddler
y'all thought i was gonna rhyme with riddler
didn't ya? bring your bitch i wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

i lace tunes, i'm out this world like space moons
with a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
doing whippits, passed out like sanford snippits
where's the weed, i wanna tamper with it
i'ma let your grandpa hit it
mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it
fuck it, maybe i'm a bum
but i was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
so what i'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
losing all of my leverage
went up inside the first national bank broke, and left rich
walking bio-hazard causing wreckage
smoked out like eckridge
band just making my neck itch
what the fuck? gimme the tech bitch
you just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
slap hips, support domestic violence
beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
i'm just joking, is dirty dozen's really dust smoking?
if all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in

<i>[chorus]</i>

my head's ringing, like it was spider sense tingling
lit it like green bay did when they shitted on new england
i'm out the game, put the second string in
this brandy got my swinging
bobbing back and forth like a penguin
delinquent, toking microphones with broken english
make your mama be like "ohh! this is good! who sing this?"
"slim shady, his tape is dope, i love it
it's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit."
it was predicted by a medic
i'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
living off liquid triametic
pathetic, but i don't think this headache's ever vanishing
panicing, i think i might have just took too much anasin
frozen manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue
i think i'm dying, god is that you?
somebody help me, before i od on an lp
take me to er asap for and iv
motherfuck jlb, they don't support no hip hop
they say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is tupac
it's politics, it's all a fix
setup by these white blue collared hicks
just to make a dollar off of black music
with a subliminal ball of tricks
but those can kiss ass and swallow dicks

<i>[chorus]</i>


life by marshall mathers
what is life?
life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
and every time you think you've gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
what are friends?
friends are people that you think are your friends
but they're really your enemies, with secret identities
and disguises, to hide their true colors
so just when you think you're close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
what is money?
money is what makes a man act funny
money is the root of all evil
money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
what is life?
i'm tired of life
i'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
i'm tired of committing so many sins
tired of always giving in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never having any ends
tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
i'm tired of this dj playing your shit when he spins
tired of not having a deal
tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
tired of drowning in my sorrow
tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
i'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
i'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wonders why i'm smartin' off
i'm tired of being fired every time i fart and cough
tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk
i'm tired of using plastic silverware
tired of workin' at builder's square
tired of not being a millionaire

but if i had a million dollars
i'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand, i'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while i'm on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because i'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

i'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
i'm tired of not having a phone
tired of not having a home to have one in if i did have it on
tired of not driving a bm
tired of not working at gm, tired of wanting to be him
tired of not sleeping without a tylenol pm
tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
tired of not being on tour
tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
in the back of a contour
i'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
tired of being stared at
i'm tired of wearing the same damn nike air hat
tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of lugz
tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on "nobody's as ill as me"
i'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
tired of jlb saying "where hip-hop lives"

but if i had a million dollars
i'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand, i'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while i'm on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because i'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

you know what i'm saying?
i'm tired of all of this bullshit
telling me to be positive
how'm i supposed to be positive when i don't see shit positive?
know what i'm sayin'?
i rap about shit around me, shit i see
know what i'm sayin'? right now i'm tired of everything
tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city
can't get no airplay, you know what i'm sayin'
but hey, it's cool though, you know what i'm sayin'?
just fed up
that's my word


<i>[intro: frogg]</i>
whoa!
a get your hands in the air, and get to clapping 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is what you thought it wasn't
it beez the brothers representin' the dirty dozen
i be the f-r-o the double g <i>[coughing in background]</i>
and check out the man he goes by the name of er...

<i>[verse one: eminem]</i>
slim shady, brain dead like jim brady
i'm a meighty, you lil' like that kim lady
i'm buzzing, dirty dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
cursing at you players worse than marty schottenheimer
you wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
you ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
i'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
my name is marshall mathers, i'm an alcoholic (hi marshall)
i have a disease and they don't know what to call it
better hide your wallet 'cause i'm coming up quick to strip your cash
bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
bitch, i'm coming out swinging, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
you getting knocked the fuck out like mike tyson
the +proof+ is in the pudding, just ask the deshaun holton
i'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than ron goldman

<i>[verse two: eminem]</i>
i'm nicer than pete, but i'm on a search to crush a milkbone
i'm everlasting, i melt vanilla ice like silicone
i'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
i'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezing
flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
i'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
i'll make your freak leave you, smell the folgers crystals
this is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
but i form like voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
slim shady, eminem was the old initials (bye-bye!)
extortion, snorting, supporting abortion
pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
the looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
half animal, half man
dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
with more holes than an afghan

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three: eminem]</i>
somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
i'm a caged demon, on stage screaming like rage against the machine
i'm convinced i'm a fiend, shooting up while this record is spinning
clinically brain dead, i don't need a second opinion
fuck dropping the jewel, i'm flipping the sacred treasure
i'll bite your motherfucking style, just to make it fresher
i can't take the pressure, i'm sick of bitches
sick of nagging bosses bitching while i'm washing dishes
in school i never said much, too busy having a headrush
doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
then i went to jim beam, that's when my face grayed
went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
don't take me for a joke i'm no comedian
too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smoking weed again
i'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
finally made it home, but i don't got the key to get in

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[outro: eminem]</i>
shit, fuck everything...
outsiders, pace one, young zee.
fuck the entire world...


just the two of us.. <i>[eightx]</i>

<i>[swift]</i>
i make rappers wanna turn into singers

got your whole crew doing subpeonas
hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
keep it close, you can't beat us
while your whole crew treat us like g's, you best believe this
i done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects
while the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret
that your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state
makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
i'm like two-face, i'm painful to rappers then you can tell
from these shells, how i gotta bend 'em like route canals
i erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
be within a twenty-five to life sentence, on linkin' trials
horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
everything is foul when swift's around, vacate now
niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
i'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, blaaaow!

it's swifty from the three hundred and thirteen
like i said no one is iller than me, unnhh!

<i>[bizarre]</i>
me and eminem and mike
drivin' down van dyke
get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
still on probation for stranglin' my boy jason
should be takin' my medication, it's nine to ten i'm facin'
last week this old man i had to blast
cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til i checked her pocketbook
fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
better explain where the hell your tvs and vcrs is at
i done lost one hundred pounds, i ain't been eatin' like i should
this wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!
rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route 
throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell "everybody get out"!
my girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a two-piece
cuz she found out i was havin' an affair with her ten-year old niece

no one, no one's iller than me
it's bizarre kid straight from the three hundred and thirteen
no one, no one is iller than me
it's bizarre kid straight from the three hundred and thirteen

<i>[eminem]</i>
nobody better test me, cuz i don't wanna get messy
especially when i step inside this bitch, dick freshly
new lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
before i do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
true thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
whippin' forty-bottles like the fuckin' pepsi clubs
down a fifth, crack open a six
i'm on my seventh eight-ball, now i gotta take a piss
i'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
who gives a fuck who they was
i'm always takin' someone else's girl like cool j does
they probably don't be packin' anyways, do they fuzz?
we walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
mics get sandblasted
stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when i ran past it
fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted
kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in saran plastic
get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
furious four motherfuckers
flashin' in front of your face without the grand masters

slim shady, ain't nobody iller than me

<i>[fuzz]</i>
i run shit like an ass with legs
massive lead to leave your cabbage red
similar to your ass in a casket dead
drastic spread of acid heads
come to abort you like a bastard egg
that trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
ask the feds from past the edge
rockin' the most classic threads
flashin' bread, roll down the window
bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
you can get 'til that ass get red
bizarre you get him and him, swift you get him and him
i'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga eminem
never writer's block, i block writers
my block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
some bitch ran up screamin' get the cops quick!
and got drop kicked, now she screamin' "stop it..."
got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
wherever you shop bitch, fuzz scooter 'ninety-seven crop pick
sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like i got tits
i shoot a rocket through your optic
you niggaz still don't know the top pick?
i got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
and have you shittin' socks bitch!
we rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
grab the green from al by showin' him hot grits
(no one...)

ain't nobody iller than me

<i>[bizzare]</i>
it's the mr. fuzzy from the three hundred and thirteen
no one, no one is iller than me
it's eminem and swift from the three hundred and thirteen
no one, no one is iller than me
it's fuzz and buzz-arre from the three hundred and thirteen

you have now witnessed four ill emcees!
from the home of potholes and trash

<i>[chorus]</i>
all i see is murder murder, my mind state - <i>[twopac]</i>

all i see is murder murder, my mind state
murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!
<i>[twox]</i>

left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
went up in eastland and shot a policeman
fuck a peace plan of citizen bystands
but shit is in my hands, here's your life span
for what your life's worth this money is twice than
grab a couple grand and live a nice land
see i'm a nice man but money turned me to satan
i'm thirsty for this green so bad i'm dehydratin'
hurry up with the cash bitch, i got a ride waitin'
shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'
i want the whole pie, i won't be denied nathan
maybe i need my head inside straightened
brain contemplatin', clean out the register
dip before somebody catches ya
or gets ya description an' sketches ya
the connection was the prime suspect
but i ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
cuz i got a daughter to feed
and $two hundred ain't enough to water the seed
the best thing would be for me to leave taco bell an' hit up chess king
and have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the mac
cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
this bitch tried escapin' the jack
grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
you barely heard a word as she choked
it wasn't nuttin' for her to be smoked
but i slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
just then the pigs bust in yellin' "freeze!"
but i'm already wanted for sellin' keys
and bunch of other felonies from a to z like spellin' bees
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees
i bust shots, they bust back
hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest

<i>[chorus twox]</i>

left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out
need a backin' out this lady's jag started blackin' out
pulled the mac-ten out, stuck it in her face
shut ya yackin' mouth before i blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
drug her by her hair, smacked her up
thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
stole her car, made a profit
grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
like the girl on set it off did
jetted off kid, stole the whip, now i'm a criminal
drove in thru somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
climbed out and collapsed on the patio
i made it out alive but i'm injured badly though
parents screamin': "son, go in and call the police
tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
actin' like they never seen nobody hit a nick before
smashed the window, grabbed the nintendo sixty-four
when they sell out in stores the price triples
i ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
and colliding with an eighty-year old lady with groceries
there goes the cheese, eggs, milk and post toasties
stood up and started to see stars
too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
but i think somebody seen me maybe
plus i lost the damn nintendo and i must-a dropped the beanie baby
fuck it i give up, i'm surrounded in blue suits
came out with a white flag hollerin' "truce truce!"
surrendered my weapon to cops
wasn't me! it was the gangsta rap and the peppermint schnopps

and dr. dre said, "slim shady, you a basehead" (uh-uh)
"then why's your face red? man, you wasted"
well, since age twelve, i felt like i'm someone else
'cause i hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
got pissed off and ripped pamela lee's tits off
and smacked her so hard i knocked her clothes backwards like kris kross
i smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast

my english teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (shh)
thanks a lot, next semester i'll be thirty-five
i smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (owwwwwwww!)
walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
while they're screaming at me, "let's just be friends"
ninety-nine percent of my life, i was lied to
i just found out my mom does more dope than i do (damn)
i told her i'd grow up to be a famous rapper
make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
(oh, thank you)
you know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screaming usher fans
(ahh, ahh, ahh)
this guy at white castle asked for my autograph (dude, can i get your autograph?)
so i signed it, "dear dave, thanks for the support, asshole"

dr. dre, don't just stand there, operate
i'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (fuck that)
i'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(huh, yup)
am i coming or going? i can barely decide
i just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (go ahead)
all my life i was very deprived
i ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (whoops)
clothes ripped like the incredible hulk
i spit when i talk, i'll fuck anything that walks (come here)
when i was little, i used to get so hungry i would throw fits
how you gonna breastfeed me, mom? you ain't got no tits
i lay awake and strap myself in the bed
with a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (bang)
'cause i'm steaming mad (grr)
and by the way, when you see my dad (yeah?)
tell him that i slit his throat in this dream i had

meet eddie, twenty-three-years-old
fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store
("i can't take this no more, i can't take it no more homes")
but on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
and suddenly, his conscience comes into play
("shit is mine, i gotta do this, gotta do this")

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
alright, stop! (huh?)
now before you walk in the door
of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
you better think of the consequence
(but who are you?)
i'm your motherfuckin' conscience

<i>[eminem]</i>
that's nonsense!
go in, gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
and borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
tell her you need a place to stay
you'll be safe for days
if you shave your legs with renee's razor blades

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
the whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
think about it before you walk in the door first
look at the store clerk, she's older than george burns

<i>[eminem]</i>
fuck that! do that shit! shoot that bitch!
can you afford to blow this shit? are you that rich?
why you give a fuck if she dies? are you that bitch?
do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

<i>[dr. dre (eminem)]</i>
man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it!
(you're right!)
not over this shit (stop!) drop the biscuit (i will!)
don't even listen to slim yo, he's bad for you
(you know what dre? i don't like your attitude)

("it's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute")
("mmm, i don't know!")
("look baby")
("damn!")
("yo, it's gonna be alright, right?")
("well ok.")

meet stan, twenty-one-years-old
("give me a kiss!")
after meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
once again, his conscience comes into play
("shit!")

<i>[eminem (dr. dre)]</i>
now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek
and smearing her lipstick, i slipped this in her drink
now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(yo! this girl's only fifteen years old
you shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
yo, look at her bush. does it got hair? (uh huh!)
fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
'til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(man, ain't you ever seen that one movie kids?)
no, but i seen the porno with son doobiest!
(shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
man fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail

here i lay
(damn it feels good to be home)

meet grady, a twenty-nine-year-old construction worker
after coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man
("what the fuck?!")
("grady!")

<i>[dr. dre (eminem)]</i>
alright calm down, relax, start breathing

<i>[eminem]</i>
fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
while you at work she's with some dude trying to get off?!
fuck slitting her throat, cut this bitch's head off!

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
wait! what if there's an explanation for this shit?
(what? she tripped? fell? landed on his dick?!)
alright shady, maybe he's right grady
but think about the baby before you get all crazy

<i>[eminem (dr. dre)]</i>
okay! thought about it, still wanna stab her?
grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
that's what i did, be smart, don't be a retard
you gonna take advice from somebody who slapped dee barnes?!
(what you say?)
what's wrong? didn't think i'd remember?
(i'mma kill you motherfucker!)

<i>[eminem]</i>
uh-ha! temper temper!
mr. dre? mr. n.w.a.?
mr. ak comin' straight outta compton y'all better make way?
how in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
'cause he don't need to go the same route that i went
been there, done that. aw fuck it
what am i saying? shoot em both grady, where's your gun at?

these are the results of a thousand electric volts
a neck with bolts, "nurse we're losin him, check the pulse!"
a kid who refused to respect adults
wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
a corny lookin white boy, scrawny and always ornery
cause i was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me
and i might snap, one day just like that
i decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
(whosssssh) my first day in junior high, this kid said,
"it's you and i, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"
i looked at my watch it was one twenty
"i already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!?"
he said, "don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse..."
my palms were sweaty, and i started to shake at first
something told me, "try to fake a stomach ache it works"
i screamed, "owww! my appendix feels like they could burst!
teacher, teacher, quick i need a naked nurse!"
<i>[n]</i> "what's the matter?"
<i>[e]</i> "i don't know, my leg, it hurts!"
<i>[n]</i> "leg?!? i thought you said it was your tummy?!?"
<i>[e]</i> "oh, i mean it is, but i also got a bum knee!"
<i>[n]</i> "mr. mathers, the fun and games are over.
and just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework."
<i>[e]</i> "but don't you wanna give me after school detention?"
<i>[n]</i> "nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and i'ma let him."

brain damage, ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin
but everywhere i go they keep playin my song

<i>[eminem]</i>
brain damage..
way before my baby daughter hailey
i was harassed daily by this fat kid named d'angelo bailey
an eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose,
soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
i tried to plead and tell him, "we shouldn't beef"
but he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and i couldn't breathe
he looked at me and said, "you gonna die honkey!"
the principal walked in (what's going on in here?)
and started helpin him stomp me
i made them think they beat me to death
holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
"this is for every time you took my orange juice,
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.
i'm gettin you back bully! now once and for good."
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it til i broke the wood
knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot..
.. made it home, later that same day
started reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
i couldn't even see what i was tryin to read
i went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed
my mother started screamin, "what are you on, drugs?!?
look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!" (sorry!)
she beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull
i picked it up and screamed, "look bitch, what have you done?!?"
<i>[m]</i> "oh my god, i'm sorry son"
<i>[e]</i> "shut up you cunt!" i said, "fuck it!"
took it and stuck it back up in my head
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
brain damage..
it's brain damage..
i got brain damage..
it's brain damage..
it's probably brain damage..
it's brain damage..
brain damage..
i got brain damage..

okay, i'm going to attempt to drown myself
you can try this at home
you can be just like me
mic check one two, we recording?

i'm cancerous so when i diss you wouldn't want to answer this
if you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for canibus
i strangle you to death then i choke you again
and break your fucking legs
'til your bones poke through your skin
you beef with me, i'mma even the score equally
take you on jerry springer and beat your ass legally
i get too blunted off of funny home grown, âcause when i smoke out i hit the trees harder than sonny bono (oh no!)
so if i said i never did drugs, that would mean i lie and get fucked more than the president does
hilary clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
i ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet (bitch!)
my nerves hurt, and lately i'm on edge
grabbed vanilla ice and ripped out his blond dreads (fuck you!)
every girl i ever went out with has gone les
follow me and do exactly what the song says
smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
and drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
i'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
so i'm dumb enough to ask for a date with lauryn hill
some people only see that i'm white, ignorin' skill
cause i stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
but i don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
how the fuck can i be white? i don't even exist
i get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
my middle finger won't go down, how do i wave?
and this is how i'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

now follow me and do exactly what you see
don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
i slap women and eat shrooms then o.d.
now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

me and marcus allen went over to see nicole
when we heard a knock at the door, must have been ron gold
jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
killed them both and smeared blood in a white bronco
my mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
i slapped garth brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
i'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
that'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
my rap style's warped
i'm running out the morgue with your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
jumped in a chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
and beat up foghorn leghorn with an acorn
i'm about as normal as norman bates with deformative traits
a premature birth that was four minutes late
mother, are you there? i love you
i never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
will someone please explain to my brain that i just severed a main vein with a chainsaw and i'm in pain?
i take a breather and sigh, either i'm high or i'm nuts
cause if you ain't tilting this room, neither am i
so when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass, then it probably is obvious i got it on with her
cause when i drop this solo shit, it's over with
i bought cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it

i came to the club drunk with a fake id
don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
i've been with ten women who got hiv
now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
i got genital warts and it burns when i pee
don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
i tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
you probably want to grow up to be just like me

(rah digga, pacewon, young zee)
<i>[em]</i>
aight, ay turn my headphones up
(bust it bust it)

<i>[eminem]</i>
my favoite color is red, like the blood shed
from kurt cobain's head, when he shot himself dead
women all grabbin at my shishkabob
bought lauryn hill's tape so her kids could starve
(i can't stand white people!)
you thought i was livid, now i'm even more so
shit i got full blown aids and a sore throat
i got a wardrobe with an orange robe {*wolf whistle*}
i'm in the fourth row, signin autographs at your show
(yo can you sign this right here?)
i just remembered that i'm absent minded
wait, i mean i've lost my mind, i can't find it
i'm freestylin every verse that i spit
cause i don't even remember the words to my shit (umm, one two)
i told the doc i need a change in sickness
and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
put my lp on your christmas gift list
you wanna get high, here bitch just sniff this

cum on everybody -- get down tonight <i>[eightx]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
yo.. yo yo yo yo
i tried suicide once and i'll try it again
that's why i write songs where i die at the end
cause i don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
and i was wavin it at everybody screamin, "i suck" (i suck!!!)
i go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
and yell out loud, "all y'all get the hell out now"
fuck rap, i'm givin it up y'all, i'm sorry
(but eminem this is your record release party!)
i'm bored out of my gourd -- so i took a hammer 
and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my ford
guess i'm just a sick sick bastard
who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (i ain't got it all)
one excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
i feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
(ohhhhhhh) and if you ever see a video for this shit
i'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

cum on everybody -- get down tonight <i>[eightx]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
got bitches on my jock out in east detroit
cause they think that i'm a motherfuckin beastie boy {*wolf whistle*}
so i told em i was mike d
they was like, "gee i don't know, he might be!"
i told em, "meet me at kid rock's next concert
i'll be standin by the loch ness monster (okay) peace out (bye!!)"
then i jetted to the weed house
smoked out til i started bustin freestyles
broke out then i dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
crushed up the tylenol and ate it with a dipstick (*slurping*}
made a couple of crank calls collect <i>[*brrrrrrring, click*]</i>
"ken kaniff from connecticut, can you accept?"
i wanna make songs all the fellas dub
and murder every rich rapper that i'm jealous of
so just remember when i bomb your set
yo, i only cuss to make your mom upset

cum on everybody -- get down tonight <i>[twentyx]</i>


a-yo!
this song is dedicated to all the happy people
all the happy people who have real nice lives
and have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

<i>[verse one:]</i>
i feel like i'm walking a tight rope, without a circus net
i'm popping percocets, i'm a nervous wreck
i deserve respect; but i work a sweat for this worthless check
'bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt
minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
full of venom and rage
especially when i'm engaged
and my daughter's down to her last diaper
that's got my ass hyper
i pray that god answers, maybe i'll ask nicer
watching ballers while they're flossing in their pathfinders
these overnight stars becoming autograph signers
we all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
along with the small fry's and average half pinters
while player haters turn bitch like they have vaginas
'cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
money'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
while snakes slither in the grass spineless

<i>[chorus (twox):]</i>
that's rock bottom
when this life makes you're mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom
when you want something bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom
when you feel like you've had it up to here
'cause you're mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

<i>[verse two:]</i>
my life is full of empty promises
and broken dreams
i'm hoping things will look up
but there ain't no job openings
i feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
and i'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
and i'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
but fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
'cause when we die we know we're all going the same way
it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
when all you need is bucks to be the man
plus a luxury sedan
too comfortable and roomy in a six
but they threw me in the mix
with all these gloomy lunatics
who walk around depressed
and smoke a pound of ses a day
and yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
my daughter wants to throw the ball but i'm too stressed to play
live half my life and throw the rest away

<i>[chorus]</i>

there's people that love me and people that hate me (yup)
but it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady
i want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame
that means i'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames
that means i'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
there's lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'cause right now i feel like i've just hit the rock bottom
i got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em (i'm done)
i'm screaming like those two cops when twopac shot 'em
holding two glocks, i hope your doors got new locks on 'em
my daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
and the rings you're wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em
and while you flaunt 'em i could be taking them to shops to pawn them
i got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?
'cause i never went gold off one song
i'm running up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

<i>[chorus]</i>


yes man
as the world turns
we all experience things in life
trials and tribulations
that we all must go through
when someone wants to test us
when someone tries our patience

<i>[eminem]</i>
i hang with a bunch of hippies
and wacky tobacco planters
who swallow lit roaches
and light up like jack-o-lanterns
outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
cause we're dope as fuck and only get a two in the source
they never should've booted me out of reform school
deformed fool,taking a shit in a warm pool
they threw me out the ramada inn
i said it wasn't me, i got a twin (oh my god its you! not again!)
it all started when my mother took my bike away
cause i murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
after that, it was straight to the forty ouncers
slappin teachers, and jacking off in front of my counselors
class clown freshman, dressed like les nessman
fuck the next lesson, i'll past the test guessing
and all the other kids said eminem's a dishead,
he'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed
may be true, till i told this bitch in gym class
that she was too fat to swim laps, she needed slim fast (who me?)
yeah bitch you so big you walked into big tanny's and stepped on jenny craig
she picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
put me in the headlock, then i thought of my guinea pig
i felt the evilness and started transforming (rarrrr!)
it began storming, i heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
grabbed that bitch by her hair
drag her across the ground
and took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
while i drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

<i>[chorus]</i>

as the world turns
these are the days of our lives
these are the things that we must go through
day by day

<i>[eminem]</i>
we drive around in million dollar sports cars
while little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
outsiders, and we suing the courts
cause we dope as fuck and only get a two in the source
hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
dressed like a sailor, standing by a pale of garbage
its almost dark and i'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
i met a slut and said "what up, its nice to meet ya"
i'd like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza
but i'm broke as fuck and i don't get paid till the first of next month
but if you care to join me, i was bout to roll this next blunt
but i ain't got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
plus i'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
so gimme all your money
and don't try nothing funny
cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me
i went to grab my gun
that's when her ass put it on me
wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
i fell through the glass doors
started causing a scene
then slid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine
jumped up with a broken back
thank god i was smocking crack all day
and doped up off coke and smack
all i wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
now i wanna kill her
but so i gotta catch her first
ran through rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut
saw the house she ran up in
and shot her fucking porch up
kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
looked around the room
that's when i seen the bedroom door shut
i know you're in there bitch! i got my gun cocked!
you might as well come out now
she said "come in, its unlocked!"
i walked in and all i smelled was liz claiborne
and seen her spread across the bed naked watching gay porn
she said "come her big boy, lets get acquainted"
i turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
she came at me at full speed, nothing could stop her
i shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
i started to beg "no, please let go"
but she swallowed my fucking leg whole like an egg roll
with one leg left, now i'm hoppin around crippled
i grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
just trying to buy me some time, then i remembered this magic trick
den den den den den den, go go gadget dick!
whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
it hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
i shouted "now bitch, lets see who gets the best!"
stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death (ah!! ah!)
come here bitch!
come here!
take this motherfucking dick!
bitch, come here!

<i>[chorus to fade]</i>

and as we go along
throughout the days of our lives
we all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
that we must go through
these are the things that surround us through our atmosphere
every day
every single day the world keeps turning


<i>[eminem]</i>
who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (huh?)
told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl (i did!)
gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
sold a billion tapes and still screamed, "fuck the world!"
(i'm slim shady..) so come and kill me while my name's hot
and shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (ow!)
i think i got a generation brainwashed
to pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot (uhh-oh)
stop they blood flow until they veins clot
i need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
purple haze and acid raindrops
spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)
shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
bad boy, i told you that i can't stop
you gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you
so everybody buy my shit or i'ma come and kill you

i got mushrooms, i got acid, i got tabs and aspirin tablets
i'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
you know me, i'm your friend, when you need a minithin
(i'm slim shady..) i'm shady!!

<i>[eminem]</i>
i like happy things, i'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)
i like birds, bees, i like people
i like funny things that make me happy and gleeful (hehehe)
like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (woo!)
the ill type, i stab myself with a steel spike
while i blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like
cause this is how i am in real life (mm-hmm)
i don't want to just die a normal death, i wanna be killed twice (uh-huh)
how you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
when they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (huh?)
so bring the money by tonight - cause your wife 
said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (help me! help me!)
i try to keep it positive and play it cool
shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (stay in school!)
cause i'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
tonight i think i'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter

i got mushrooms, i got acid, i got tabs and aspirin tablets
i'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
you know me, i'm your friend, when you need a minithin
(i'm slim shady..) i'm shady!!

<i>[eminem]</i>
yo.. i listen to your demo tape and act like i don't like it 
(aww that shit is wack!)
six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit 
(what?? that's my shit!)
people don't buy shit no more they just dub it
that's why i'm still broke and had the number one club hit (yup, uh huh)
but they love it when you make your business public
so fuck it, i've got herpes while we on the subject (uh-huh)
and if i told you i had aids y'all would play it
cause you stupid motherfuckers think i'm playin when i say it

and i don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin

you know me, i'm your friend, when you need a minithin
(i'm slim shady..) i'm shady!!

(ha hah-ha, hah-ha! ha hah, hah-ha, hah-ha, hah-ha)
y'all didn't wanna believe me!
i'm shady!!
.. and that's my name


<i>[intro - cowboy (jeff bass):]</i>
i reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
you know, there's a story behind that there saloon
twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
quickest damn gun-slingers i've ever seen
got murdered in cold-blood
that old saloon there was their little "home away from home"
they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern
and on a quiet night
you can still hear the footsteps of slim shady and royce da five'nine"

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i don't speak, i float in the air wrapped in a sheet
i'm not a real person, i'm a ghost trapped in a beat
i translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
and a noise is spread, picked up and transmitted through royce's head
trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
told him each one of his boys is dead
i asked him to come to the dark side
he made a choice and said...

<i>[royce:]</i>
who hard? yo i done heard worse
we can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
to see which one'll swerve first
two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
that of a globe on top of nine other planets
kissed the cheek of the devil
intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto
dismissal, i'm not a fair man
disgraced the race of an atheist
intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
one track sliced without swords
i buried the christ corpse
in my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
and stay over-worked, it's like the nazis and the nation
collaborating attempting to take over the earth

<i>[eminem:]</i>
cause this is what happens when bad meets evil
and we hit the trees til we look like vietnamese people
he's evil, and i'm bad like steve seagal
above the law cause i don't agree with police either (shit, me neither)
we ain't eager to be legal
so please leave me with the keys to your jeep eagle
i breathe ether in three lethal amounts
while i stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range
cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(he's insane)
no i'm not, i just want to shoot up and i'm pissed off
cause i can't find a decent vein

<i>[royce:]</i>
the disaster with dreads
i'm bad enough to commit suicide
and survive long enough to kill my soul after i'm dead
when in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
cause i serve any stranger with money
i spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
while slipping bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws
with my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
i'm blazing mcs, at the same time amazing mcs
somehow, mcs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me
from all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough
to cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt

<i>[interlude:]</i>
<i>[phone rings]</i>
hello? (billy) aiyyo what's up (we're comin to get you)
stop, they know it's us!!

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i used to be a loudmouth, remember me?
i'm the one who burned your house down, well i'm out now
and this time i'm coming back to blow your house up
and i ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of
give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
and you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
and when i go to hell and i'm getting ready to leave
i'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

<i>[royce and eminem:]</i>
cause this is what happens when bad meets evil
and we hit the trees 'til we look like vietnamese people
he's evil, and i'm bad like steve seagal
against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel
(we'll be waiting) see you in hell
wall street, royce da five'nine", slim shady
see you in hell for the sequel (bye-bye)
bad meets evil, what ('til next time)

<i>[cowboy:]</i>
and so that's the story when bad meets evil
two of the most wanted individuals in the county
made jesse james and billy the kid look like law-abiding citizens
it's too bad they had to go out the way they did
got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon
but their spirits still live on till this day
shhh...<i>[spits]</i> wait, did y'all hear that?
<i>[footsteps and windblowing]</i>


<i>[eminem]</i>
a lot of people ask me.. am i afraid of death..
hell yeah i'm afraid of death
i don't want to die yet
a lot of people think.. that i worship the devil..
that i do all types of.. retarded shit
look, i can't change the way i think
and i can't change the way i am
but if i offended you? good
cause i still don't give a fuck

i'm zonin off of one joint, stoppin a limo
hopped in the window, shoppin a demo at gunpoint
a lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
fuck a needle, here's a sword, bodypierce with this
livin amuk, never givin a fuck
gimme the keys i'm drunk, and i've never driven a truck
but i smoke dope in a cab
i'll stab you with the sharpest knife i can grab
come back the next week and re-open your scab (yeah!)
a killer instinct runs in the blood
emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud
i've calmed down now -- i was heavy once into drugs
i could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
my brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
the rest of my body's still bein operated on
i'm ducked the fuck down while i'm writin this rhyme
cause i'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time

for all the weed that i've smoked - yo this blunt's for you
to all the people i've offended - yeah fuck you too!
to all the friends i used to have - yo i miss my past
but the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
for all the drugs that i've done - yo i'm still gon' do
to all the people i've offended - yeah fuck you too!
for everytime i reminisce - yo i miss my past
but i still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

<i>[eminem]</i>
i walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
and cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
i'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
and pull you apart from both angles
i wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins
and bust open like broken water mains
so tell saddam not to bother with makin another bomb 
cause i'm crushin the whole world in my palm
got your girl on my arm and i'm armed with a firearm
so big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
buy your mom a shirt with a slim shady iron-on
and the pants to match ("here momma try em on")
i get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives,
a brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(shittin on rappers) causin hospital accidents
god help me before i commit some irresponsible acts again 

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
i wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
spend a million a track and went over my budget (ohh shit!)
now how in the fuck am i supposed to get out of debt?
i can't rap anymore - i just murdered the alphabet
drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches
i'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
i don't rap to get the women - fuck bitches 
give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
never ran with a click - i'm a posse
kamikaze, strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me
from the second i was born, my momma lost me 
i'm a cross between manson, esham and ozzy
i don't know why the fuck i'm here in the first place 
my worst day on this earth was my first birthday
retarded? what did that nurse say? brain damage?
fuck, i was born during the earthquake

<i>[chorus]</i>


yo.. yo! <i>[eminem hachs up spit]</i>
mic check...(my dick!)
testing...one, two <i>[eminem hach up spit on mic]</i>
ffff-fuck...(my dick!) my nuts..

my attitude is worse than n.w.a.'s was
i'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
who ain't have shit to do with it, like cool j does (my tattoo!)
you see me standin outside of your buildin; screamin,
puffy is good, (hey!) but slim shady is for the children! (wait!)
i look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
give me two mics; i write songs for me -- fuck what you like
you're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause i don't like rap anyway
i'm just tryin to get my porno career started
every place and event.. (been there, done that)
shit, dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
<i>[zipper sound]</i> come on, let's go!
want a deal? study these five chapters
lesson one: throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
lesson two: face em and diss em (whattup dog?)
don't give 'em a demo; kidnap 'em (i want you to come with me)
and make em come to your basement and listen
(you're gonna fuckin check this out)
lesson three: get a job at a label; switch demos with canibus
and put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
lesson four: know you heard this before:
"hey let me get your number; i'll call you tomorrow, for sure!"
don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed? 
get the whitest a&amp;r you can find
pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
lesson five: get a hook-up at jive
dress up like i.c.p and have them come see you perform live
and that's the key, but when you see me on the street; i ain't
givin you shit bitch - don't even bother askin me (get away from me!)
toilet water splashes me right in the ass when i'm spittin
cause i'm always shittin when i'm rappin like master p (unnnggggh!)
got a blowjob from paula jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
my balls broke both of her collarbones (oww!)
told mya this shit was all about me-ah (it's all about me..)
gave alyssa milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea (you're a dick!)
and all three of my main girls said see-ya
cause brandy and monica walked in and caught me fuckin aaliyah
(what? oh my god!) i splish splash while i'm takin a bath
grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
white trash -- fuckin your wife in the ass (oh! ooh shady! oooh!)
while you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass

<i>[chorus]</i>
so if i hurt your self-esteem
and you get dissed too bad (yo why you diss me?)
you know i just be sayin that to get you mad
and when i rap about a buncha shit you wished you had (a big dick!)
you know i just be sayin that to get you mad
i can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!
you know i just be sayin that to get you mad
he'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad! (nurse! nurse!)
you know i just be sayin that to get you mad

what a wonderful day; i should go outside and play
ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
hi renee! (oh hi!) i was just about to toss a live grenade
in your driveway (what?) and drive away <i>[car peels out]</i>
are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with aids
blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache
you talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
i'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh (mooooo!)
jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed cage with (agent orange)
and wiped my ass with his page in source (here!)
the demon is here, steamin this year
i rip (mystikal's) voicebox out, scream in his ear (ahhhhhh!)
it's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image i live it
give a fuck? i don't know what a fuck is to give it
yeah i don't think this guy is well.. i'm high as hell
i'll beat you with a live cat when i'm swinging him by his tail

<i>[impersonating method man]</i>
i'll fuckin', i'll fuckin'
lay your nuts on the dresser
just your nutsack by itself
and bang them shits with a spiked bat
cut your neck off and sew your head right back
and leave you like that

you just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than chris-topher
reeves, i was teething with strep throat
while your mother was breastfeeding
and gave her the flesh-eating disease
i'm iller than takin a hammer and beatin your knees
and walkin through south central l.a., bleedin in jeans
(am i a blood or a crip?) wakin up the next day in breathin machines
flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
on how you just got smoked, and if you do live
you'll be too scared to tell it, like a biggie and 'pac joke

<i>[chorus]</i>

i know that makes you real mad, don't it? (uh-huh)
that's right, slim shady (yup) sway &amp; tech
sprayin' wreck (bitch!)
and we don't give a heck (uh-uh)
or a damn.. or a fuck.. or a shit
so suck my motherfuckin dick


when i was just a little baby boy,
my momma used to tell me these crazy things
she used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
she used to tell me he hated me

but then i got a little bit older
and i realized, she was the crazy one
but there was nothing i could do or say to try to change it
'cause that's just the way she was

they said i can't rap about being broke no more
they ain't say i can't rap about coke no more
slut, you think i won't choke no whore
'til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!

these motherfuckers are thinking i'm playing
thinking i'm saying the shit 'cause i'm thinking it just to be saying it
put your hands down bitch, i ain't gon' shoot you
i'mma pull you to this bullet, and put it through you

shut up slut, you're causing too much chaos
just bend over and take it like a slut, ok ma?
"oh, now he's raping his own mother,
abusing a whore, snorting coke, and we gave him the rolling stone cover?"

you're goddamn right bitch, and now it's too late
i'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
i invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
vain vicodin, vrinn vrinn, vrinnn!

texas chainsaw, left his brains all
dangling from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
blood, guts, guns, cuts
knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

bitch i'mma kill you! you don't wanna fuck with me
girls neither â you ain't nothing but a slut to me
bitch i'mma kill you! you ain't got the balls to beef
we ain't gon' never stop beefing i don't squash the beef

you better kill me! i'mma be another rapper dead
for popping off at the mouth with shit i shouldn't have said
but when they kill me â i'm bringing the world with me
bitches too! you ain't nothing but a girl to me

i said you don't wanna fuck with shady ('cause why?)
'cause shady will fucking kill you
i said you don't wanna fuck with shady (why?)
'cause shady will fucking kill you

bitch i'mma kill you!
like a murder weapon, i'mma conceal you
in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
fuck with me, i been through hell, shut the hell up!
i'm tryna develop these pictures of the devil to sell 'em

i ain't "acid rap", but i rap on acid
got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
whoops! is that a subliminal hint? no!
just criminal intent to sodomize women again
eminem offend? no! eminem'll insult
and if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
to do it again, then, if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumping out of something up on the tenth

bitch i'mma kill you, i ain't done this ain't the chorus
i ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
a bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times in a tub
but that's normal ain't it norman?

serial killer hiding murder material
in a cereal box on top of your stereo
here we go again, we're out of our medicine
out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

or i'mma kill you! you don't wanna fuck with me
girls neither â you ain't nothing but a slut to me
bitch i'mma kill you! you ain't got the balls to beef
we ain't gon' never stop beefing i don't squash the beef

you better kill me! i'mma be another rapper dead
for popping off at the mouth with shit i shouldn't have said
but when they kill me i'm bringing the world with me
bitches too! you ain't nothing but a girl to me

i said you don't wanna fuck with shady ('cause why?)
'cause shady will fucking kill you
i said you don't wanna fuck with shady (why?)
'cause shady will fucking kill you

eh-heh, know why i say these things?
'cause ladies' screams keep creeping in shady's dreams
and the way things seem, i shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
this eighty gs a week to say the same things tweece!

twice? whatever, i hate these things
fuck shots! i hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?

fuck that! i'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
from fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
from principal to the student body and counselor
from in-school to before school to out of school

i don't even believe in breathing
i'm leaving air in your lungs
just to hear you keep screaming for me to seep it
ok, i'm ready to go play
i got the machete from o.j.
i'm ready to make everyone's throats ache

you faggots keep egging me on
'til i have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
shut up! give me your hands and feet
i said shut up when i'm talking to you
you hear me? answer me!

or i'mma kill you! you don't wanna fuck with me
girls neither â you ain't nothing but a slut to me
bitch i'mma kill you! you don't got the balls to beef
we ain't gon' never stop beefing i don't squash the beef

you better kill me! i'mma be another rapper dead
for popping off at the mouth with shit i shouldn't have said
but when they kill me â i'm bringing the world with me
bitches too! you ain't nothing but a girl to me
bitch i'mma kill you!

you don't wanna fuck with shady ('cause why?)
'cause shady will fucking kill you
i said you don't wanna fuck with shady (why not?)
'cause shady will fucking kill you..

i'm just playing, ladies
you know i love you


<i>[dido:]</i>
my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad


<i>[eminem as stan:]</i>
dear slim, i wrote you but you still ain't calling
i left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or something
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? man, how's your daughter?
my girlfriend's pregnant, too, i'm bout to be a father
if i have a daughter, guess what i'mma call her?
i'mma name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie, too, i'm sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this everyday, but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
i like the shit you did with rawkus, too, that shit was phat
anyways, i hope you get this, man, hit me back
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
this is stan

<i>[dido:]</i>
my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window and i can't see at all
and even if i could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

<i>[eminem as stan:]</i>
dear slim, you still ain't called or wrote, i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad - i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother man, he's only six years old
we waited in the blistering cold for you
for four hours and you just said, "no"
that's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
he wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than i do
i ain't that mad though, i just don't like being lied to
remember when we met in denver - you said if i'd write you
you would write back - see i'm just like you in a way
i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when i have a shitty day, i drift away and put 'em on
'cause i don't really got shit else so that shit helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real, and i respect you 'cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you twenty-four/seven
but she don't know you like i know you slim, no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
you gotta call me man, i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours, stan
p.s.
we should be together, too

<i>[dido:]</i>

<i>[eminem as stan:]</i>
dear mister i'm-too-good-to-call-or-write-my-fans,
this'll be the last package i ever send your ass
it's been six months and still no word. i don't deserve it?
i know you got my last two letters;
i wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
so this is my cassette i'm sending you, i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now, i'm doing ninety on the freeway
hey slim, i drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
you know the song by phil collins "in the air of the night"
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't, then phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
that's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
now it's too late. i'm on a one thousand downers now, i'm drowsy
and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i loved you, slim, we coulda been together, think about it
you ruined it now, i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream i hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
see, slim,âshut up bitch! i'm trying to talk!
hey, slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,
but i didn't slit her throat, i just tied her up. see, i ain't like you
'cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
well, gotta go, i'm almost at the bridge now
oh shit, i forgot, how am i supposed to send this shit out?
<i>[*car tires squeal, crash, loud splash*]</i>

<i>[eminem:]</i>
dear stan, i meant to write you sooner but i've just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
look, i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother
i wrote it on the starter cap
i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show, i musta missed you
don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you
but what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
i say that shit's just clowning , dawg
c'mon! how fucked up is you?
you got some issues, stan, i think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be together?
that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter, i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, i think that you'll be doing just fine
if you relax a little, i'm glad i inspire you but, stan
why are you so mad? try to understand, that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy shit
i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
come to think about it, his name was... it was you
damn!


i never knew i..
i never knew i..
mic check one-two
i never knew i..
who woulda knew?
i never knew i..
who'da known?
i never knew i..
fuck would've thought
i never knew i..
motherfucker comes out
i never knew i..
and sells a couple of million records
i never knew i..
and these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
i never knew i..

<i>[eminem]</i>
i don't do black music, i don't do white music
i make fight music, for high school kids
i put lives at risk when i drive like this {*tires screech*}
i put wives at risk with a knife like this (ahhh!!)
shit, you probably think i'm in your tape deck now
i'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
ducked the fuck way down, waitin to straight jump out
put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?
oh - you want me to watch my mouth, how?
take my fuckin eyeballs out, and turn em around?
look - i'll burn your fuckin house down, circle around
and hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out
(oh my god! oh my god!) i'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
you want me to fix up lyrics while the president gets his dick sucked?
<i>[*ewwww*]</i> fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
quit tryin to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
(the kids!) but don't blame me when lil' eric jumps off of the terrace
you shoulda been watchin him - apparently you ain't parents

cause i never knew i, knew i would get this big
i never knew i, knew i'd effect this kid
i never knew i'd, get him to slit his wrist
i never knew i'd, get him to hit this bitch
i never knew i, knew i would get this big
i never knew i, knew i'd effect this kid
i never knew i'd, get him to slit his wrist
i never knew i'd, get him to hit this bitch

<i>[eminem]</i>
so who's bringin the guns in this country? (hmm?)
i couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in london
and last week, i seen a schwarzaneggar movie
where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
i sees three little kids, up in the front row,
screamin "go," with their seventeen-year-old uncle
i'm like, "guidance - ain't they got the same moms and dads
who got mad when i asked if they liked violence?"
and told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
what about the make-up you allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear?
(hmm?) so tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
when his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse
("go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick!")
and fuck was the first word i ever learned
up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird (look!)
so read up, about how i used to get beat up
peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every three months
my life's like kinda what my wife's like (what?)
fucked up after i beat her fuckin ass every night, ike
so how much easier would life be
if nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
i never knew i.. knew i'd..
have a new house or a new car
a couple years ago i was more poorer than you are
i don't got that bad of a mouth, do i?
fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop (what?)
skibbedy-be-bop, a-christopher reeves
sonny bono, skis horses and hittin some trees (hey!)
how many retards'll listen to me
and run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a
teach-er, her, him, is it you is it them?
"wasn't me, slim shady said to do it again!"
damn! how much damage can you do with a pen?
man i'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought
slim shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
i just said it - i ain't know if you'd do it or not

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
how the fuck was i supposed to know?


whatever...
dre, just let it run
aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
aiyyo... this song is for anyone... fuck it
just shut up and listen, aiyyo...

i sit back with this pack of zig zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this - on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensing these sentences
getting this stress that's been eating me recently off of this chest
and i rest again peacefully (peacefully)...
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
in the streets when i'm eating or feeding my daughter
do not come and speak to me (speak to me)...
i don't know you and no,
i don't owe you a motherfucking thing
i'm not mr. n'sync, i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr. friendly, i can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)...
no patience is in me and if you offend me
i'm lifting you ten feet (lifting you ten feet)... in the air
i don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of all you (of all you)...
i don't mean to be mean, but that's all i can be it's just me

sometimes i just feel like my father,
i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
and, "oh, it's his lyrical content -
- the song 'guilty conscience' has gotten such rotten responses"
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me (finger at me)...
so i point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
when a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn (on marilyn)... and the heroin
where were the parents at? and look where it's at
middle america, now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see, an upper class city
having this happening (this happening)...
then attack eminem 'cause i rap this way (rap this way)...
but i'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire
to burn and it's burning and i have returned

i'm so sick and tired of being admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top on "my name is... "
and pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
that got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
and i just do not got the patience (got the patience)...
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
i'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause i talk
with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep asking
the same fucking questions (fucking questions)...
what school did i go to, what hood i grew up in
the why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'til i'm grabbing my hair and i'm tearing it out
'cause they driving me crazy (driving me crazy)... i can't take it
i'm racing, i'm pacing, i stand and i sit
and i'm thankful for every fan that i get
but i can't take a shit, in the bathroom
without someone standing by it
no, i won't sign your autograph
you can call me an asshole i'm glad

<i>[eminem]</i>
may i have your attention please?
may i have your attention please?
will the real slim shady please stand up?
i repeat, will the real slim shady please stand up?
we're gonna have a problem here..

y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam and tommy just burst in the door
and started whooping her ass worse than before
they first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (ah!)
it's the return of the... "ah, wait, no way, you're kidding,
he didn't just say what i think he did, did he?"
and dr. dre said... nothing, you idiots!
dr. dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (ha-ha!)
feminist women love eminem
<i>[*vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*]</i>
"slim shady, i'm sick of him
look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
flipping the you-know-who." "yeah, but he's so cute though!"
yeah, i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes, i wanna get on tv and just let loose, but can't
but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
"my bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
and if i'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course they gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they got the discovery channel, don't they?
"we ain't nothing but mammals.." well, some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes <i>[slurp]</i>
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
<i>[*ewww!*]</i> but if you feel like i feel, i got the antidote
women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

<i>[chorus â eminem (repeat twox):]</i>
'cause i'm slim shady, yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up?

<i>[eminem]</i>
will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records;
well i do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
you think i give a damn about a grammy?
half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"but slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
why? so you guys could just lie to get me here?
so you can, sit me here next to britney spears?
yo shit, christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch, put me on blast on mtv
"yeah, he's cute, but i think he's married to kim, hee-hee!"
i should download her audio on mpthree
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd <i>[ahhh!]</i>
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
so i have been sent here to destroy you <i>[bzzzt]</i>
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
it just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
i'm like a head trip to listen to, cause i'm only giving you
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it
in front of y'all and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it <i>[*err*]</i> i just shit it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
it's funny; 'cause at the rate i'm going when i'm thirty
i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurses asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurking
he could be working at burger king, spitting on your onion rings
<i>[*hach*]</i> or in the parking lot, circling
screaming "i don't give a fuck!"
with his windows down and his system up
so, will the real shady please stand up?
and put one of those fingers on each hand up?
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

<i>[chorus fourx]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
ha ha
guess there's a slim shady in all of us
fuck it, let's all stand up


<i>[spray can being shook up and sprayed several times]</i>

<i>[rbx:]</i>
remember me? ("step in, execution")
remember me? ("i have no remorse")
remember me? ("i'm 'high powered'")
remember me? ("i drop bombs like hiroshima")

for this one it's the x, you retarded?
cause i grab the mic and get down, like syndrome
hide and roam into the masses, without boundaries
which qualifies me for the term "universal"
without no rehearsal, i leak words that's controversial
like i'm not, the one you wanna contest, see
cause i'll hit yo' ass like the train did that bitch
that got "banned from tv" - heavyweight hitter
hit you watch your whole head split up
loco-is-the-motion, we comin through
hollow tips is the lead, the .forty-five threw

<i>[sticky fingaz:]</i>
remember me? ("throw ya gunz in the air!")
remember me? ("slam! slam!")
remember me? ("nigga 'bacdafucup'")
remember me? ("chka-chka-onyx!")

niggaz that take no for an answer, get told no
yeah i been told no but it was more like, "no, no, no!!!"
life a bitch that'll fuck you if you let her
better come better than better to be a competitor
this vet is ahead of
the shit is all redder, you deader and deader
a medic instead-a the cheddars and credda
settle vendetta one metal beretta from ghetto to ghetto
evidence? nope! never leave a shred-of
i got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
my moms got raped by the industry and made me
i'm the illest nigga ever, i told you
i get more pussy than them dyke bitches total
want beef, nigga? pbbt! you better dead that shit
my name should be "can't-believe-that-nigga-said-that-shit"
probably sayin, "he ain't a killer", but i'm killin myself
smoke death, fuck bitches raw, on the kitchen floor
so think what i'ma do to you, have done to you
got niggaz in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
what you wanna do, cocksuckers? we glock busters
'til the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
'round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
i'm gettin wires niggaz wantin me dead, wantin my head
you think it could be somethin i said? {*echoes*}

<i>[eminem:]</i>
remember me? ("i just don't give a fuck!")
remember me? ("yeah, fuck you too!")
remember me? ("i'm low down and i'm shifty!")
remember me? ("i'm shady!")

when i go out, i'ma go out shootin
i don't mean when i die, i mean when i go out to the club, stupid
i'm tryin to clear up my fuckin' image
so i promised the fuckin critics
i wouldn't say "fuckin" for six minutes
(*click* six minutes, slim shady, you're on)
my baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
so i made me a song, killed her and put hailie on
i may be wrong, i keep thinkin these crazy thoughts
in my cranium, but i'm stuck with a crazy mom
("is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?")
came home, and somebody musta broke in the back window
and stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
sick sick dreams of picnic scenes, two kids, sixteen
with m-sixteen's and ten clips each
and them shits reach through six kids each
and slim gets blamed in bill clint's speech to fix these streets?
fuck that! pbbt! you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
and re-appear in hell with a can of gas, and a match
aftermath, dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
(what the fuck you starin at, nigga?)

don't you remember me?!
remember me?!!
remember me??!
remember me!!!!


<i>[chorus xfour:]</i>
that's why they call me slim shady
(i'm back)
i'm back (i'm back)
i'm back (slim shady)

i murder a rhyme, one word at a time
you never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
you better get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help
what good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
i'm waitin' for hell, like hell, shit, i'm anxious as hell
manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
i used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
thirteen, i was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
i used to get punked and bullied on my block
'til i cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
i used to give a fuck, now i could give a fuck less
what do i think of success? it sucks, too much press
i'm stressed, too much cess, depressed
too upset, it's just too much mess
i guess i must just blew up quick (yes)
grew up quick (no) was raised right
whatever you say is wrong, whatever i say's right
you think of my name now whenever you say hi
became a commodity because i'm w-h-i-
-t-e, 'cause mtv was so friendly to me
can't wait 'til kim sees me!
now, is it worth it? look at my life, how is it perfect?
read my lips, bitch! what, my mouth isn't workin'?
you hear this finger? oh, it's upside down
here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

<i>[chorus xfour:]</i>
that's why they call me slim shady
(i'm back) i'm back
(i'm back) i'm back
(slim shady)

i take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
and if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
<i>[vocal scratches]</i> my name is slim shady
i been crazy way before radio didn't play me
the sensational <i>[vocal scratch "back is the incredible!"]</i>
with ken kaniff, who just finds the men edible
it's ken kaniff on the internet
tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
it's a sick world we live in these days
"slim, for pete's sakes, put down christopher reeve's legs!"
geez, you guys are so sensitive
"slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
whose eyes get so squinted
i'm blind from smoke in 'em, with my windows tinted
with nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
with a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo scented
and that's where i get my name from, that's why they call me

<i>[chorus xfour:]</i>
that's why they call me slim shady
(i'm back) i'm back
(i'm back) i'm back
(slim shady)

i take seven (kids) from (columbine)
stand 'em all in line, add an ak-forty-seven, a revolver, a nine
a mac-eleven and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
'cause (i'mmmm) shady, they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole ytwok thing
and by the way, n'sync, why do they sing?
am i the only one who realizes they stink?
should i dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
it's why i tend to block out when i hear things
'cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (ahh)
so i just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that i was stickin' it to christina
'cause if i ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
it'd be jennifer lopez - and puffy, you know this
i'm sorry puff, but i don't give a fuck
if this chick was my own mother
i'd still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
and have a son and a new brother at the same time
and just say that it ain't mine - what's my name?

<i>[chorus xfour:]</i>
that's why they call me slim shady
(i'm back) i'm back
(i'm back) i'm back
(slim shady)

<i>[vocal scratching]</i>
guess who's b-back, back
gue-gue-guess who's back (hi mom!)
<i>[scratch]</i> guess who's back
<i>[scratch]</i> gue <i>[scratch]</i> guess who's back
d-twelve <i>[scratch]</i> guess who's back
gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back
dr. dre <i>[scratch]</i> guess who's back
back back <i>[scratch]</i> back
<i>[scratch]</i>
slim shady, two thousand and one
i'm blew out from this blunt (sighs) fuck


you know i just don't get it
last year i was nobody
this year i'm selling records
now everybody wants to come around like i owe em something
heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
get the fuck out of here

you see i'm, just marshall mathers (marshall mathers)
i'm just a regular guy,
i don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
nobody ever gave a fuck before,
all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
now everybody wanna run their mouth
and try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

yo, you might see me jogging, you might see me walking
you might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
with its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollering at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barking
(grrrr, arf arf) or leaning out a window, with a cocked shotgun
driving up the block in the car that they shot 'pac in
looking for big's killers, dressing ridiculous
blue and red like i don't see what the big deal is
double barrel twelve gauge bigger than chris wallace
pissed off, 'cause biggie and 'pac just missed all this
watching all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
and amidst all this crist' popping and wrist watches
i just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of remy martin
starting shit like some twenty-six-year-old skinny cartman ("god damnit!")
i'm anti-backstreet and ricky martin
whose instinct's to kill n'sync, don't get me started
these fuckin' brats can't sing and britney's garbage
what's this bitch retarded? gimme back my sixteen dollars
all i see is sissies in magazines smiling
whatever happened to wiling out and being violent?
whatever happened to catching a good old-fashioned
passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
new kids on the block, sucked a lot of dick
boy/girl groups make me sick
and i can't wait 'til i catch all you faggots in public
i'ma love it.. (hahaha)
vanilla ice don't like me (uh-uh)
said some shit in vibe to spite me (yup)
then went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe)
a bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
and run around screaming, "i don't care, just bite me" (nah nah)
i think i was put here to annoy the world
and destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
plus i was put here to put fear in faggots who spray faygo root beer
and call themselves "clowns" 'cause they look queer
faggy two dope and silent gay
claiming detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)
and i don't wrestle, i'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
(ahhh!) ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!
look at y'all running your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fuckin mile road, south of ten
and i don't need help, from dtwelve, to beat up two females
in make-up, who may try to scratch me with lee nails
"slim anus," you damn right, slim anus
i don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!

'cause i'm, just marshall mathers (marshall mathers)
i'm not a wrestler guy,
i'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
come and see me on the streets alone
if you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
and if you wanna run your mouth
then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)

is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
you little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck puffy
now because of this blonde mop that's on top
of this fucked up head that i've got, i've gone pop?
the underground just spunned around and did a three hundred and sixty
now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"oh, he just did some shit with missy,
so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with mc get-bizzy"
my fuckin bitch mom's suing for ten million
she must want a dollar for every pill i've been stealing
shit, where the fuck you think i picked up the habit?
all i had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
which is it bitch, mrs. briggs or ms. mathers?
it doesn't matter your <i>[attorney fred gibson's a]</i> faggot!
talking about i fabricated my past
he's just aggravated i won't ejaculate in his ass (uh!)
so tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
for every million i make, another relative sues
family fighting and fussing over who wants to invite me to supper
all of a sudden i got ninety some cousins (hey it's me!)
a half-brother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on tv
now everybody's so happy and proud
i'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
hey-hey! and then to top it off, i walked to the newsstand
to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
and what do i see? a picture of my big white ass
okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:
uh, here â double xl, double xl
now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
ah fuck it, i'll even buy a couple myself

you see i'm, just marshall mathers (marshall mathers)
i'm just a regular guy,
i don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
nobody ever gave a fuck before,
all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
now everybody wanna run their mouth
and try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

you see i'm, just marshall mathers (marshall mathers)
i'm just a regular guy,
i don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
nobody ever gave a fuck before,
all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
now everybody wanna run their mouth
and try to take shots at me (take shots at me)


yeah, hahahaha...whooooo, shit!
aight, guess what? i ain't coming in yet...
i'll come in a minute
ayo...this is my love song...it goes like this

back when mark wahlberg was marky mark
(fuckin' faggot)
this is how we used to make the party start
we used to mix hen' with bacardi dark
and when it kicks in you can hardly talk

and by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
and you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
and my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall

and everything's spinning
you're beginnin' to think women
are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
then in a couple of minutes
that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches

you have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
over the island and cause a forty-two-car pile-up

earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
all i can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
and i'm so high that i might die if i go by it
let me out of this place
i'm outta place
i'm in outer space
i've just vanished without a trace
i'm going to a pretty place
now where the flowers grow
i'll be back in an hour or so

'cause every time i go to try to leave
someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
i don't wanna, but i gotta stay
these drugs really got a hold of me

'cause every time i try to tell them "no"
they won't let me ever let them go
i'm a sucker all i gotta say
these drugs really got a hold of me

in third grade, all i used to do
was sniff glue through a tube and play rubik's cube
seventeen years later i'm as rude as jude
scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs

i've got no game
and every face looks the same
they've got no name
so i don't need game to play

i just say whatever i want to whoever i want
whenever i want, wherever i want, however i want

however i do show some respect to few
this ecstasy's got me standing next to you
getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you
we just met but i think i'm in love with you

but you're on it too
so you tell me you love me too
wake up in the morning like
"yo, what the fuck we do?"
i gotta go bitch
you know i got stuff to do
'cause if i get caught cheatin' then i'm stuck with you

but in the long run
these drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
but fuck it, i'm on one
so let's enjoy
let the x destroy your spinal cord
so it's not a straight line no more
'til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
so bye for now
i'm going to try to find some more

'cause every time i go to try to leave
someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
i don't wanna, but i gotta stay
these drugs really got a hold of me

'cause every time i try to tell them "no"
they won't let me ever let them go
i'm a sucker all i gotta say
these drugs really got a hold of me

that's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
when you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
and tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
what's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? screw it
and what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
and what's a little fight?
tomorrow you'll be boys again
it's your life
live it however you wanna
marijuana is everywhere
where was you brought up?
it don't matter as long as you get where you're going
âcause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
they tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring
even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning

but you're young
you've got a lot of drugs to do
girls to screw
parties to crash
sucks to be you
if i could take it all back now, i wouldn't
i would have did more shit that people said that i shouldn't
but i'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
did better drugs and updated
but i've still got a lot of growing up to do
i've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew

but when it's all said and done i'll be forty
before i know it with a forty on the porch telling stories
with a bottle of jack
two grandkids in my lap
babysitting for hailie while hailie's out getting smashed

'cause every time i go to try to leave
someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
i don't wanna, but i gotta stay
these drugs really got a hold of me

'cause every time i try to tell them "no"
they won't let me ever let them go
i'm a sucker all i gotta say
these drugs really got a hold of me

'cause every time i go to try to leave
someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
i don't wanna, but i gotta stay
these drugs really got a hold of me

'cause every time i try to tell them "no"
they won't let me ever let them go
i'm a sucker all i gotta say
these drugs really got a hold of me

drugs really got a hold of me
really got a hold of me
'cause drugs really got a hold of me
they really got a hold of me

off of the world's misery - what in the world gives me the right
to say what i like, and walk around flippin the bird
livin the urban life, like a white kid from the 'burbs
dreamin at night of screamin at mom, schemin to leave
run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
i just want you all to notice me and people to see
that somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
it just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
so when you see me, dressin up like a nerd on tv
or heard the cd usin the fag word so freely
it's just me being me, here want me to tone it down?
<i>[lower pitch]</i> suck my fuckin dick, you faggot

a lot of people ask me stupid fucking questions.
a lot of people think that what i say on a record or what i talk about on a record, that i actually do in real life or that i believe in it.
or if i say that i wanna kill somebody that i'm actually gonna do it or that i believe in it.
well, shit, if you believe that then i'll kill you.
you know why?
'cause i'm a criminal

criminal
you're goddamn right
i'm a criminal
yeah, i'm a criminal

my words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
that'll stab you in the head
whether you're a fag or lez
or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
pants or dress
hate fags? the answer's "yes"

homophobic? nah, you're just heterophobic
staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
that's my motherfucking balls,
you'd better let go of 'em
they belong in my scrotum,
you'll never get hold of 'em

"hey, it's me, versace
whoops, somebody shot me!
and i was just checking the mail."
get it? checking the 'male'?

how many records you expecting to sell
after your second lp sends you directly to jail?
c'mon! relax guy, i like gay men
right, ken? give me an "amen". a-men!

please lord, this boy needs jesus
heal this child, help us destroy these demons
oh, and please send me a brand new car
and a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital

preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
you can't reach me, my mom can't neither
you can't teach me a goddamn thing
'cause i watch tv, and comcast cable
and you ain't able to stop these thoughts
you can't stop me from topping these charts
and you can't stop me from dropping each march
with a brand new cd for these fucking retards
and to think, it's just little ol' me
mr. don't-give-a-fuck still won't leave

<i>[twox]</i>
i'm a criminal
'cause every time i write a rhyme,
these people think it's a crime
to tell 'em what's on my mind
i guess i'm a criminal
but i don't gotta say a word,
i just flip 'em the bird
and keep going, i don't take shit from no one

my mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
the baby came out disfigured, ligaments indeed
it was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me

i'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
but how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
so as i got older and i got a lot taller
my dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

i drink more liquor
to fuck you up quicker
than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word ...
my morals went ... when the president got oral
sex in his oval office on top of his desk
off of his own employee

now don't ignore me,
you won't avoid me
you can't miss me, i'm white, blonde-haired
and my nose is pointy
i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
in plane crashes and laughs
as long as it ain't happened to him

slim shady, i'm as crazy as eminem and kim combined
"the maniac's in" in place of the doctor
'cause dre couldn't make it today
he's a little under the weather,
so i'm taking his place

oh, that's dre with an ak to his face
don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
i told you dre, you should've kept that thang put away
i guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
i'm a criminal

aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
aight
i'll be right here waiting on you
aight
yo em
what?!
don't kill nobody this time
awwright. goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fucking nerves
aha?
how you doin'?
hi, how can i help you?
yeah i need to make a withdrawal
okay
put the fucking money in the bag bitch and i won't kill you!
what? oh my god, don't kill me
i'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit looking around.
don't kill me, i've got two kids at home don't kill me, don't kill me
i said i'm not gonna fucking kill you
hurry the fuck up! thank you!
go, go, go!

windows tinted on my ride when i drive in it
so when i rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
so i'll be disguised in it
and if anybody identifies the guy in it
i'll hide for five minutes

come back, shoot the eyewitness
fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
this puppy's lucky i didn't blast his ass yet

if i ever gave a fuck, i'd shave my nuts
tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
you motherfucking chickens ain't brave enough
to say the stuff i say, so just tape it shut

shit, half the shit i say, i just make it up
to make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
and if it's not a rapper that i make it as
i'mma be a fucking rapist in a jason mask

<i>[fourx]</i>
i'm a criminal
'cause every time i write a rhyme,
these people think it's a crime
to tell 'em what's on my mind
i guess i'm a criminal
but i don't gotta say a word,
i just flip 'em the bird
and keep going, i don't take shit from no one


<i>[mr. mackey]</i> <i>[eric cartman]</i>
and everyone should get along..
okay children quiet down, quiet down
children i'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
his name is mr. shady
children quiet down please
brian don't throw that (shut up!)
mr. shady will be your new substitute 
while mr. kaniff is out with pneumonia (he's got aids!)
good luck mr. shady

<i>[eminem]</i>
hi there little boys and girls (fuck you!)
today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
but first, i'd like you to meet my friend bob (huh?)
say hi bob! ("hi bob") bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
and he don't got a job, cause bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (ahh!)
and even if they escaped and they got the cops
the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'til one night mrs. stacey went off the job
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
crazier than slim shady is off the vodka
you couldn't even take him to dre's to get bob a "dr."
he grabbed stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacey went off to wander
they never found her, and bob still hangs at the waffle diner
and that's the story of bob and his marijuana, 
and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you 

see children, drugs are bahhhd (c'mon)
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (ask him man)
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right)
she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
so kids say no to drugs (that's right)
so you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)
then there's really nothin else to say (sing along)
drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?

<i>[eminem]</i>
my penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? 
fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (huh?)
speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
if someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
so don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
meet zach, twenty-one years old 
after hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
and his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*} 
his back starts tah - look like the mcdonald's arches
he's on donald's carpet, layin horizontal barfin {*bleh*}
and everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
"hey adam, zach is a jackass, look at him!"
cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
so they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
meanwhile, zach's in a coma, the action is over
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga
and that's the story of zach, the ecstasy maniac
so don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you

see children, drugs are bahhhd (that's right)
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (that's right)
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can)
she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
so kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)
so you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
and there's really nothin else to say (but umm)
drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?

<i>[eminem]</i>
and last but not least, one of the most humungous
problems among young people today, is fungus
it grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 
bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
yum yum! then you start to see some dumb stuff
and everything slows down when you eat some of 'em..
and sometimes you see things that aren't there (like what?)
like fat woman in g-strings with orange hair
(mr. shady what's a g-string?) it's yarn claire
women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (huh?)
and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
whoops, did i say magic mushrooms? i meant fungus
ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue (how come?)
cause it comes from a cow's dung (gross!!)
see drugs are bad, it's a common fact
but your mom and dad, know that's all that i'm good at (oh!)
but don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and o.d.
they're gonna come for me and i'ma have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault
so don't do drugs, and do exactly as i don't, 
cause i'm bad for you

see children, drugs are bahhhd (uh-huh)
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (put that down)
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can ask)
she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will)
so kids say no to drugs (say no)
so you don't act like everyone else does (like i do)
and there's really nothin else to say (that's right)
drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?

<i>[mr. mackey]</i> <i>[eric cartman]</i>
come on children, clap along (shut up!)
sing along children (suck my motherfuckin dick!)
drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (south park is gonna sue me!)
so don't do drugs (suck my motherfuckin penis!)
so there'll be more for me (hippie! god damnit!)
(mushrooms killed kenny! *fart* ewww, ahhh!)
(so, fucked up, right now..)


america, we love you
how many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours
the stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect the women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the united states government has sworn to uphold
(yo', i want everybody to listen to the words of this song) or so we're told...

i never would've dreamed in a million years i'd see
so many motherfuckin' people who feel like me,
who share the same views and the same exact beliefs.
it's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me.

so many lives i touched, so much anger aimed,
in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays.
and straight through your radio waves it plays and plays,
'til it stays stuck in your head for days and days.

who would've thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair
with some peroxide reaching for a t-shirt to wear,
that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
how could i predict my words would have an impact like this?

i must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office,
cause congress keeps telling me i ain't causin' nothin' but problems,
and now they're sayin' i'm in trouble with the government,
i'm lovin' it,
i shoveled shit all my life,
and now i'm dumping it on

white america, i could be one of your kids,
white america, little eric looks just like this,
white america, erica loves my shit,
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get,
white america, i could be one of your kids,
white america, little eric looks just like this,
white america, erica loves my shit,
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get

look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself,
if they were brown, shady lose, shady sits on the shelf,
but shady's cute, shady knew, shady's dimples would help
make ladies swoon, babyâooh, baby!âlook at my sales,

let's do the math, if i was black, i would've sold half, i
ain't have to graduate from lincoln high school to know that,
but i could rap, so fuck school, i'm too cool to go back,
gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at,

when i was underground, no one gave a fuck i was white,
no labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, i was like
"fuck it!" until i met dre, the only one to look past,
gave me a chance, and i lit a fire up under his ass,

helped him get back to the top, every fan black that i got
was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got,
like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow,
i'm like my skin is just starting to work to my benefit now,
it's

white america, i could be one of your kids,
white america, little eric looks just like this,
white america, erica loves my shit,
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get,
white america, i could be one of your kids,
white america, little eric looks just like this,
white america, erica loves my shit,
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get

see the problem is i speak to suburban kids
who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss,
'til i created so much motherfuckin' turbulence,

straight out the tube right into your living rooms i came,
and kids flipped when they knew i was produced by dre,
that's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in,
and they connected with me too because i looked like them,

that's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope,
searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
waitin' to choke
tightening around my throat,
watching me while i write this,
like i don't like this,
nope,

all i hear is lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy,
sponsors working 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
surely hip-hop was never a problem
in harlem
only in boston,
after it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom,

so now i'm catchin' the flak
from these activists when they raggin',
actin' like i'm the first rapper
to smack a bitch, or say "faggot",

shit, just look at me like i'm your closest pal,
the posterchild,
the motherfuckin' spokesman now for...

white america, i could be one of your kids,
white america, little eric looks just like this,
white america, erica loves my shit,
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get,
white america, i could be one of your kids,
white america, little eric looks just like this,
white america, erica loves my shit,
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get

so to the parents of america,
i am the derringer aimed at little erica
to attack her character,
the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress,
and piss on the lawns of the white house,
to burn the flag and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
to spit liquor
in the faces of in this democracy of hypocrisy

fuck you, ms. cheney,
fuck you, tipper gore,
fuck you with the freest of speech this divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have,
fuck you,

i'm just playin', america, you know, i love you

quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
gee willikers dre, "holy bat syllables!"
look at all the bullshit that goes on
in gotham when i'm gone
time to get rid of these rap criminals
so skip to your lou while i do what i do best
you ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
flows too wet, nobody close to it
nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
the most hated on out of all those who say
they get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
they make it all up, there's no such thing
like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
it just means so much more to so much more
people when you're rappin' and you know what for
the show must go on; so i'd like to welcome y'all
to marshall and andre's carnival, c'mon!

now let's get down to business

i don't got no time to play around, what is this?
must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
on these clowns; can i get a witness? (hell yeah!)

it's just like old times, the dynamic duo
two old friends, why panic? you already know
who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
you can even call collect, the most feared duet
since me and elton played career russian roulette
and never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
people steppin' over people just to rush to the set
just to get to see an mc who breathes so freely
ease over these beats and be so breezy
jesus, how can shit be so easy?
how can one chandra be so levy?
turn on these beats, mc's don't see me
believe me, bet and mtv
are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
but we ain't fuckin' around round here
yo, dre (what up?) can i get a "hell yeah"? (hell yeah!)

now let's get down to business
i don't got no time to play around, what is this?
must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
on these clowns; can i get a witness? (hell yeah!)

so there you have it, folks
(marshall!) has come to save the day
back with his friend andre
here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
because (marshall!) and andre are here to stay
and never go away, until our dying day
until we're old and grey (marshall!)
so until next time, friends
same blonde hair, same rap channel
good night, everyone! thank you for coming!
your host for the evening (marshall!)
oh! heh


where's my snare?
i have no snare in my headphones. there you go
yeah... yo, yo

have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
i have; i've been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding
tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as i'm breathing
keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
look at me now; i bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama?
i'mma make you look so ridiculous now

i'm sorry mama!
i never meant to hurt you!
i never meant to make you cry; but tonight
i'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
i said i'm sorry mama!
i never meant to hurt you!
i never meant to make you cry, but tonight
i'm cleaning out my closet

ha! i got some skeletons in my closet
and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
i'mma expose it; i'll take you back to 'seventy-three
before i ever had a multi-platinum-selling cd
i was a baby, maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'cause he split, i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i don't. on second thought i just fucking wished he would die
i look at hailie, and i couldn't picture leaving her side
even if i hated kim, i'd grit my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human, but i'm man enough to face them today
what i did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take them bullets outta that gun
'cause i'da killed him; shit i would've shot kim and him both
it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to "the eminem show"

i'm sorry mama!
i never meant to hurt you!
i never meant to make you cry; but tonight
i'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
i said i'm sorry mama!
i never meant to hurt you!
i never meant to make you cry, but tonight
i'm cleaning out my closet

now i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing
but put yourself in my position; just try to envision
witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
going through public housing systems, victim of mã¼nchausen's syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasn't
'til i grew up, now i blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach
doesn't it? wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me ma?
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma?
but guess what? you're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
and nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
and hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful
but you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
you selfish bitch; i hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
well guess what, i am dead, dead to you as can be!

i'm sorry mama!
i never meant to hurt you!
i never meant to make you cry; but tonight
i'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
i said i'm sorry mama!
i never meant to hurt you!
i never meant to make you cry, but tonight
i'm cleaning out my closet

i'm sorry mama!
i never meant to hurt you!
i never meant to make you cry; but tonight
i'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
i said i'm sorry mama!
i never meant to hurt you!
i never meant to make you cry, but tonight
i'm cleaning out my closet

i'm a soldier, i'm a soldier, i'm a soldier, i'm a soldier

yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
never was a gangster, 'til i graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain
for weapon concealin'
took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'

willin' to stick out my neck
for respect
if it meant life or death
never live to regret what i said
when you're me
people just want to see
if it's true, if it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do
so they feel
it's part of your obligation to fulfill
when they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
in confrontation
ain't no conversation
if you feel you're in violation
any hesitation'll get you killed, if you feel it, kill it
if you conceal it, reveal it
being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
pull it, squeeze it, 'til it's empty
tempt me, push me, pussies
i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

i'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
they won't budge
i'll never fall or fold up
i'm a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble
i'm a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they won't budge
i'll never fall or fold up
i'm a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never stumble

i love pissin' you off
it gets me off
like my lawyers, when the fuckin' judge lets me off
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
i'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
i'm a lit fuse
anything i do bitch, it's news
pistol-whippin' motherfuckin' bouncer six'two"
who needs bullets
as soon as i pull it, you sweat bullets
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully
it's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
you can hurt 'em
and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
it's like pourin' salt in the wounds
assault and get sued
you can smell the lawsuits soon as i waltz in the room
everybody halts and stops, and calls the cops
all you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
runnin' and duckin' out the hot rocks parking lot
you'll all get shot whether it's your fault or not, 'cause

i'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
they won't budge
i'll never fall or fold up
i'm a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble
i'm a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they won't budge
i'll never fall or fold up
i'm a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never stumble

i spit it slow so these kids know that i'm talkin' to 'em
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
i'm like a thug, with a little bit of pac influence
i spew it, and look how i got you bitches rockin' to it
you motherfuckers could never do it like i could do it
don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest
i spit the illest shit, ever been dropped in two-inch
so ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
listen to the sound of kim as she licks on a cock
listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
motherfuckers know that i'll never be marshall again
full of controversy
until i retire my jersey
'til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
and lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, i'm a

i'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
they won't budge
i'll never fall or fold up
i'm a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble
i'm a soldier
these shoulders hold up so much
they won't budge
i'll never fall or fold up
i'm a soldier
even if my collar bones crush or crumble
i will never stumble

yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left
yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left
yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left
yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left


<i>[chorus]</i>
sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to hollywood
sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to hollywood
sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to hollywood
sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to hollywood
{hollywood}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to hollywood
{why do i feel this way}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to hollywood
sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to hollywood
sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to hollywood

<i>[verse one]</i>
i thought i had it all figured out, i did
i thought i was tough enough to stick it out with kim
but i wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
i found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave
how come i couldn't see this shit myself, it's just me
nobody couldn't see the shit i felt
knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when i fell, to catch me
the minute shit was heated she just bailed
i'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
i couldn't even see the millimetere when it fell
turned around saw gary stashin' the heater in his belt
saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
i just sold two million records, i don't need to go to jail
i'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
i need to slow down
try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now i'm...

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse two]</i>
bury my face in comic books, cause i don't want to look
at nothin', this world's too much
i've swallowed all i could
if i could swallow a bottle of tylenol i would, and end it for good
just say goodbye to hollywood
i probably should, these problems are piling all at once
cause everything that bothers me, i got it bottled up
i think i'm bottomin' out
but i'm not about to give up, i gotta get up
thank god, i got a little girl
and i'm a responsible father
so not a lot of good, i'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
must be in my blood cause i don't know how i do it
all i know is i don't want to follow in the footsteps of my dad
cause i hate him so bad
the worst fear that i had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man
if you could understand why i am the way that i am
what do i say to my fans, when i tell 'em i'm...

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three]</i>
i don't wanna quit, but shit, i feel like this is it
for me to have this much appeal like this is sick
this is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick
publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick
fuck the guns, i'm done, i'll never look at gats
if i scrap, i'll scrap like i ain't never whooped some ass
i love my fans
but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact i've sacrificed everything i have
i never dreamt i'd get to the level that i'm at, this is whack
this is more than i ever could of asked
everywhere i go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask
what about math, how come i wasn't ever good at that
it's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, i'm trapped
if i could go back, i never woulda rapped
i sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back
i just wanna leave this game with level head intact
imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein',
everything blow up and all you did was just grow
up emceeing
it's fuckin' crazy
cause all i wanted was to give hailie the life i never had
but instead i forced us to live alienated, so i'm sayin'...

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[outro]</i>
goodbye, goodbye hollywood, {goodbye},
please don't cry for me, when i'm gone for good,
{this shit is not for me},
so goodbye, goodbye hollywood,
{i'm not a fuckin' star},
please don't cry for me, when i'm gone for good,
{i'm goin' back home}...


obie, yo', i'm sick, damn, you straight dog...

<i>[chorus]</i>

that's why i ain't got no time, for these games and stupid tricks, or these bitches on my dick,
that's how dudes be getting sick, that's how dicks be getting drips, falling victims to this
shit, from these bitches on our dicks, fucking chickens with no ribs, that's why i ain't got no
time...

<i>[obie trice]</i>
yo', i woke up fucked up off the liquor i drunk, i had a bag of the skunk won in last nights
tunk, pussy residue was on my penis, denise from the cleaners, fucked me good, you should of
seen this, big booty bitch, switch unbearable, french roll stylin', body like a stallion, sizin'
up the figure while my shit getting bigger, debatin' on a fuck or do i want to be her nigga,
caressin' this bitch, plus i'm checking out them tit's, sippin' on that fine shit i ain't used
to buyin', i gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory, like takin' hoe's money, but that's
another story, for surely, the pussy on toast after we toast, her clothes fell like bishop in
juice, the womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock in that spot hotter than the
hottest block, don't stop, the response i got when i was knockin' it, clock steady tickin',
kinky finger lickin', and can on, semen's at my tip when she moans, i gotta slow down before i
cum soon, and work that nigga, like a slave owner, when i dropped off my outfit, she knew i
wanted to bone her, she foamin' at the lips, the one between them hips, pubic hairs lookin' like
some sour cream dip, without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though, pussy tighter than
conditions of us black folks, we in the final stretch, the last part of sex, i bust a fat ass
nut, then i woke up next, like what the fuck is goin' on here, this bitch evaporated, pussy and
all, just picked up and vacated, now i'm frusturated cause my dick was unprotected, and doctor
wesley tellin' me i really got that shit...

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
now i don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin', someone better get this bitch,
before she get's kicked in the stomach, and she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me
to throw her off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force and i don't wanna resort to
any violence of any sort, but what's she shovin' me for, doesn't she love me no more, wasn't she
huggin' me four minutes ago at the door, man, i'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this
whore, what would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce, she's havin' another baby
in a month, and it's yours, and you find out it isn't cause this bitch has been visitin' someone
else, and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back, to michigan, now the
plot is thickenin' worse, cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a
hearse, so you paranoid at every little cold that you get, ever since they told you this shit,
you've been holdin' your dick, so you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it, then
the doctor comes out lookin' like dennis the menace, and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby
it's aids, he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it, so you jet back home, cause you
gon' get that hoe, when you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo', cause you love
her, you never would expect that blow, obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low,
jesus, i don't believe this, bitch works at the cleaners, bringin' me home diseases, swingin'
from obie's penis, she's so deceivin', shit this hoe's a genius, she g'd us...

<i>[chorus]</i>

two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside

guess who's back, back again
shady's back, tell a friend
guess who's back
guess who's back
guess who's back
guess who's back
guess who's back
guess who's back
guess who's back

i've created a monster
'cause nobody wants to see marshall no more
they want shady i'm chopped liver
well if you want shady, this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jump-start my heart
quicker than a shock
when i get shocked at the hospital by the doctor
when i'm not cooperating
when i'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)

you waited this long now stop debating
'cause i'm back i'm on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job ms. cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating

so the fcc won't let me be
or let me be me so let me see
they try to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me

so come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that
cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuits
fuck you, debbie!

now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me

i said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me

little hellions kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed, their parents still listen to elvis
they start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"

a visionary, vision is scary
could start a revolution
polluting the air waves a rebel
so just let me revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissing my ass
and it's a disaster
such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
you ask for me?

well i'm back
fix your bent antennae
tune it in and then i'm gonna enter in
and up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention back for the winter

i'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
testing attention please
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my ten cents my two cents is free
a nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me

i said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me

a tisk-it a task-it
i'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
chris kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards

and moby
you can get stomped by obie
you thirty-six year old bald-headed fag blow me
you don't know me
you're too old
let go
it's over, nobody listens to techno

now let's go, just give me the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol

but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm disgusting
but it's just me i'm just obscene

no, i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

there's a concept that works
twenty million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'd be so empty without me

now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me

i said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me

kids


these ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walking around with his headphones blaring
alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
he's a problem child
what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about
his fuckin' dad walkin' out
'cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
he sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
his step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose
his house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions go...

(come on!) sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
in the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy, only have one homie
only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
yet everybody just feels like they can relate, i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
it's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
from standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
to havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
but then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
to get their hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
that's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me
they're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense pete
it's all political, if my music is literal, and i'm a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i couldn't, i wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, guerrera, that was a fist that hit you...

(come on!) sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (sing that shit!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it too
well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
see what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
and they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
but music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
it's fucked up ain't it
how we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
that's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
we're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
that's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it
'cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...

sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

<i>[intro - spoken:]</i>
yo, i can't sing but
i feel like singin'
i wanna fuckin' sing
'cause i'm happy

yeah, i'm happy
ha ha
i got my baby back
yo, check it out

<i>[verse one - sung:]</i>
some days i sit starin' out the window
watchin' this world pass me by
sometimes i think there's nothin' to live for
i almost break down and cry

sometimes i think i'm crazy
i'm crazy, oh, so crazy
why am i here, am i just wasting my time?

but then i see my baby
suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes

<i>[verse two - sung:]</i>
my baby girl <i>[hailie laughs]</i> keeps gettin' older
i watch her grow up with pride
people make jokes 'cause they don't understand me
they just don't see my real side

i act like shit don't phase me,
inside it drives me crazy
my insecurities could eat me alive

but then i see my baby
suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes, oh, no.

<i>[verse three - rapped:]</i>
man, if i could sing, i'd keep singing this song to my daughter
if i could hit the notes, i'd blow something as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her, how proud i am that i got her
god, i'm a daddy, i'm so glad that her mom didn't <i>[*want her* backwards]</i>
now you probably get this picture from my public persona
that i'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his mama,
but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'cause there's a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul,
and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world
and i think my neck is breaking.
should i just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
now look, i love my daughter more than life in itself,
but i got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
but i handle it well, given the circumstances i'm dealt
so many chances, man, it's too bad, could've had someone else
but the years that i've wasted are nothing to the tears that i've tasted
so here's what i'm facin':
three felonies, six years of probation
i've went to jail for this woman,
i've been to bat for this woman
i've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
man, i should've seen it comin', what'd i stick my penis up in?
would've ripped the pre-nup up if i'd seen what she was fuckin'
but fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby, baby the only lady that i adore, hailie
so sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
my baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
it's like the greatest gift you can get
the weight has been lifted

<i>[outro - spoken:]</i>
woo!
i told you i can't sing
oh well, i tried
hailie, 'member when i said
if you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
guess what?
daddy's here
and i ain't goin' nowhere baby
i love you! <i>[*kiss*]</i>


<i>[bizarre:]</i>
music, reality
sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
but we as entertainers
have a responsibility to these kids... psych!

<i>[eminem:]</i>
if i were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
would you feel sorrow, or show love? or would it matter?
could never be the lead-off batter
if there ain't shit for me to feed off, i'm see-saw battlin'
but there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
there's too much on my plate
i done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
and not say what i got to say
what the fuck you take me for, a joke? you smoking crack?
'fore i do that, i'd beg mariah to take me back
i'll get up 'fore i get down
run myself in the ground, 'fore i put some wack shit out
i'm tryna smack this one out the park: five-thousand mark
y'all steady tryna drown a shark
ain't gon' do nothing but piss me off
lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
see me leap out, pull a piece out
fuck shooting, i'm just tryna knock his teeth out
fuck with me now, bitch; let's see you freestyle!
talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
yo, slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
he tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
man, i hate this crap, this ain't rap
this is crazy, the way we act when we confuse hip-hop
with real life when the music stops

<i>[swifty mcvay:]</i>
ain't no getting rid of mcvay, if so, you would've tried
the only way i'm leaving this bitch is suicide
i have died clinically
arrived back at my enemies' crib with hennessy
got drunk then i finished him
i'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
i spark willingly, with a dillinger in the dark, diligently
i'm not what you think, i appear to be fucked up
mentally endangered; i can't stay away from a razor
i just want my face in a paper
i wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
to awake neighbours for acres
i'll murder you; i gauge and have me turn into a mad man
son of sam; bitch, i'm surgical
i'm allergic to dying â you think not?
you got balls? we can see how large, when the music stops

<i>[kon artis:]</i>
i was happy having a deal at first
thought money would make me happy
but it only made my pain worse
it hurts when you see your friends
turn their back on you, dawg
and you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
and you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
begging with their hands out
checking for your record when it's selling
when it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
no girls, just the gin you drink till your car spin
you think "damn!" when you slam into the wall
and you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
i'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
if my funeral's tomorrow
wonder would they even call? when the music stops

<i>[kuniva:]</i>
let's see how many of your men loyal
when i pull up looking for you with a pistol
sipping a can of penzoil
i'm revved up; who said what? when lead bust
your head just explode with red stuff, i'm handcuffed
tossed in the paddy-wagon
bragging about how you shouted like a coward
bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
if i was you niggas, i'd run while given the chance
understand, i can enhance the spirit of man
death itself, it can't hurt me
just the thought of dying alone that really irks me
you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
be smart and stop tryna walk how gs walk before we spark
hug the floor while we playing tug-of-war with your life
fuck a tour and a mic, i'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
deliver that shit that coroners like
you hype, popping shit in broad daylight
nigga, you're a goner at night; when the music stops

<i>[proof:]</i>
instigators turn pits in cages
let loose and bit the neighbors; wrist to razors
y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
in the dark, my dogs all bark, like, "woof!"
proof, nigga, i'm a wolf
get your whole roof caved in, like reindeer hoofs
stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
the more y'all breathe, shit, the more i moves
it's hill street: this is hardcore blues
put a gun to rap, check in all our dues
or make the news, bet you all y'all move
when the uzi pop, you better drop, when the music stop

<i>[bizarre:]</i>
music has changed my life in so many ways
brain's confused, been fucked since the fiveth grade
ll told me to "rock the bells"
nwa said "fuck the police," now i'm in jail
ninety-three was strictly r&amp;b
fucked up haircut, listened to jodeci
michael jackson â who gon' tell me i ain't mike?
ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' priscilla tonight
flying down sunset, smoking crack
transvestite in the front, eddie murphy in the back
m.o.p. had me grimey and gritty
marilyn manson: i dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties
ludacris told me to throw them bows
now i'm in the hospital with a broken nose
and a fractured elbow
voices in my head, i'm going in shock
i'm reaching for the glock, but the music stops

<i>[bang]</i>


<i>[dr. dre]</i>
huh, so i'm out the game huh?

<i>[eminem]</i>
yo dre, we riding?

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
whatever

<i>[eminem]</i>
well i'm with you homie

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
ok, let's handle this small shit

<i>[eminem]</i>
i was born to brew up storms 'n stir up shit
kick up dust, cuss 'til i slur up spit
grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
corrupt and i'm pour it on like syrup, bitch
thick in gritz, sick and twisted mr. buttersworth
dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
till the cow just tilts and tips 'n stumbles to earth
and if i fumble the verse, keep going
first take, i make mistakes, just keep it
no punches, pull no punches, that's weak shit
fake shit if i ever take shit, i eat shit
wasn't for him? i wouldn't be shit

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
creep with me, as we take a little trip down memory lane
been here longer than anyone in the game
and i ain't got to lie about my age

<i>[eminem]</i>
but what about jermaine?

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
fuck jermaine, he don't belong speaking mine or timbaland's name
and don't think i don't read your little interviews and see what your saying
i'm a giant, and i ain't gotta move till i'm provoked
when i see you, i'ma step on you and not even know it
ya midget, mini-me, with a bunch of little mini-you's
running around your backyard swimming pools
over eighty million records sold
and i ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds

cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
so who you playing with huh huh huh huh?

<i>[eminem]</i>
second verse, it gets worse
it gets no better than this
amateurs drink veteran piss
from a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
or confuse me with a cannabis or dre with a dupri
will rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you
blackballed and make sure you never rap a fucking again
dre ain't having it as long as i'm here to play devil's advocate

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
if there was some magic shit i could wave
over the industry that could save it when i'm gone
and bury to make sure the tradition carries on
i would

<i>[eminem]</i>
if i could only use this power for good
i wouldn't, not even if i could

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
from the hood and i'm a hornet
and i'ma only sting when i'm cornered

<i>[eminem]</i>
and i'ma only sucker punch or swing without warning
and swing to knock somebody's fucking head off
cause i know, when they get up, i won't get a chance to let off
another punch, i'm punk-rock, no one's punk
don't give a fuck, white pac, so much spunk
when i was little i knew i would blow up
and sell a mil or grow up to be attila
go nuts and be a killer

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
and i'm something of a phenom
one puff of the chron
i'm unstoppable, i'm alive, i'm on top again
there's no obstacle that i can't conquer
so come along with us (come on)

cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
so who you playing with huh huh huh huh?

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
now anybody who knows dre
knows i'm about fast cars and alize, partying all day
but i handle my business cause it's work before play
don't look for trouble but i serve you gourmet
however you want it, you could have it your way
you fuck my night up, i'ma fuck up your day
bullet with your name, sending it your way
that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
cause this is my space, you invade it
live to regret it and you die trying to violate it
fuck around and you'll get annihilated
eyes dilated

<i>[eminem]</i>
ha, like my old lady
cause what you say is what you say
sometimes what you mean is two different things
depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things
little hit of dre's weed, i can do anything
catch a contact, then i'm gone and i'm back
i speed write and my loose leaves my launch pad

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
and i can pull any string
don't have to prove anything
catch a contract on your head
you headed west, talk shit about dre?
you better get a vest, then invest in something
to protect your head and neck

<i>[eminem]</i>
and it's back and forth all day like red and meth
i joke when i say i'm the best in the booth
but a lot of truth is said in jest
and if i ever do live to be a legend
i'ma die a sudden death, five mics in the source
ain't holdin' my fucking breath
but i suffocate for the respect
fore i breathe to collect the fucking check

cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
so who you playing with huh huh huh huh?

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
watch your fuckin' mouth

<i>[timbaland]</i>
yo this timbaland, tell him i said suck <i>[chicka]</i> my dick


'cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak, and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up, but you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

yo left, yo left, yo left right left
yo left, yo left, yo left right left
yo left, yo left, yo left right left
yo left, yo left, yo left right left

'til i collapse i'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'til the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killing them
'cause when i am not then i'm 'a stop pinning 'em
and i am not hip-hop and i'm just not eminem.

subliminal thoughts when i'm 'a stop sending
them women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
amoxicillin is just not real enough.

the criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners.
you're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us.

you hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am i just a product of pop fizzing up.
for shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck.

<i>[nate dogg]</i>
'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'til the smoke clears out. am i high? perhaps
i'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.

'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'til the smoke clears out. am i high? perhaps
i'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.

music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get when you're real
and you spit and people are feeling your shit.
this is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
'cause you may never get it again.

so while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.
'cause i'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
i got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.

it goes reggie, jay-z, tupac and biggie, andre from outkast, jada, kurupt, nas and then me.
but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when i'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me.

that's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.
you hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
the press's wet dream like bobby and whitney. nate, hit me.

<i>[nate dogg]</i>
'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'til the smoke clears out. am i high? perhaps

'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'til the smoke clears out. am i high? perhaps
i'm 'a rip this shit 'til my bones collapse.

soon as a verse starts i eat it at mc's heart
what is he thinking? how not to go against me? smart.
and it's absurd how people hang on every word.
i'll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve

but i'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
'cause in my heart of hearts i know nothing could ever be worse.
that's why i'm clever when i put together every verse

my thoughts are sporadic, i act like i'm an addict
i rap like i'm addicted to smack like i'm kim mathers.
but i don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.

so this is like a full-blown attack i'm launching at them
the track is on some battling raps who want some static
'cause i don't really think that the fact that i'm slim matters
a plaque of platinum status is whack if i'm not the baddest. so...

<i>[nate dogg]</i>
'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out

'til the smoke clears out. am i high? perhaps

<i>[eminem and nate dogg:]</i>
until the roof
the roof comes off
until my legs
give out from underneath me

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i will not fall,
i will stand tall,
feels like no one can beat me.


hello boys and girls
today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
do you have a daddy?
i'll bet you do
who's your daddy?

<i>[hailie:]</i>
daddy, what're you doing?

<i>[eminem and hailie:]</i>
ok then! everybody, listen up!

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i'm going to hell, who's comin' with me?

<i>[hailie:]</i>
somebody, please help him!
i think my dad gone crazy!

there's no mountain i can't climb
there's no tower too high
no plane that i can't learn how to fly
what do i gotta do to get through to you, to show you
there ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
i cut 'em off, i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
inside of a hall, with my framed autographed
sunglasses with elton john's name, on my drag wall
i'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
all this time, me and dre been fucking with hats off

<i>[dr dre:]</i>
suck it marshall

<i>[eminem:]</i>
so tell laura and her husband to back off
before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
and launch one at these russians, and that's all
blow every fucking thing, except afghanistan on the map, off
when will it stop? when will i knock the crap off?

<i>[hailie:]</i>

rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana
and codeine and goddammit, you little motherfucker
if you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick
chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
i'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
i'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
and have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
than quit bringing my flows, quit giving me my ammo
can't you see why i'm so mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my m.o

my songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
and at the same time, can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
see what you're seeing is a genius at work
which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first
'cause when i speak, it's tongue in cheek
i'd yank my fucking teeth before i'd ever bite my tongue
i'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
and die and come back as vanilla ice's son
and walk around the rest of my life spit on
and kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung
like r. kelly as soon as "bump n' grind" comes on
more pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl inside of a
plane
aimed at the world trade, standin' on ronnie's grave
screaming at the sky, 'til clouds gather it's clyde mathers and bonnie jade
and that's pretty much the gist of it, parents are pissed, but the kids love
it
nine millimeter, heater stashed, in two-seaters with meat cleavers
i don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither

and give him the surgery that he came for

why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
and which you're gonna see in the long run
im'a be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limo tinted glass
flashing that flash-light on my ass where was you at
last night when them assholes

<i>[chorus]</i>

we as a americans
us as a citizen

living up in these streets
through worse and through better health
surviving by any means

what do we get us in
we better check ourselves
look at how shit has been
take a look where you live
this is america

im'a make buku bucks
wearing buku vests
drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
i could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
but you know who
with an "s" tattooed to my chest
but i've finessed
now i got the industry pissy
ever since me and dre split it fifty-fifty on fifty it's funny
we got a buzz spreading quicker than making paper-airplanes out of a twenty
fuck money i don't rap for dead presidents
i'd rather see the president dead
it's never been said
but i set precedents and the standards
and they can't stand it
my name should've been bastard
the shit should've been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp
i should've been blasted
i should've been had a cap pulled in my ass
but i'm too swift and fast
for that, i'm past it
i'm too old to go and cruise gratiot
fuck that shit
i done seen how fast this rap shit
can turn into some pap-pap shit
that quick
snap click
but this time they got fucking auto-ma-tic
(jamaican) and no one gon' test this mon

(sshhh)
i got a secret if you can keep it between us
i tuck two nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
under my long johns
under my sean johns
when running with the long arm of the law i'm long gone
im'a do five years no less than that
no questions asked
it might be a good idea to stop right here
and quit while i'm ahead
already in the red
already got a steady infrared meant for my head
a target on my back
bigger problems than that
bin laden on my ass
he probably gone send a task
i ain't gone even ask
they ain't gone let me pack
they ain't gone gimme my semi but i got my whizz at

<i>[intro]</i>
you still love me?
take this. <i>[two guns cock]</i>
you ready? one.. two.. three! <i>[two shots]</i>

<i>[chorus]</i>
the more you, put me through,
the more it makes me wanna come back to you,
you say you hate me, i just love you more,
you don't want me, i just want you more,
i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
i know it's sad but it's making me happy,
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
cause you love me, and i love you more.

<i>[verse one]</i>
it's sick, but who could ever predict,
we'd be doin' the same shit,
we say we do it for our baby but we don't,
we do it for us, it's lust,
cause neither one of us trusts each other,
so we fuck 'til we bust,
then we cuss each other, out,
we know what it's about,
shout 'til i throw you out the house,
you throw me out the house,
i throw you on the couch,
punch you in the mouth,
fist fight 'til we turn this mother out,
and apologize after,
laughter, pain, it's insane,
we're back in the same chapter again,
and it's sad but it's true,
when i'm layin' here with you,
there ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse two]</i>
cause i hate you, do you hate me?
good cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,
it makes me wanna just take you,
and just throw you on the bed,
and fuck you like i don't even know you,
you fuck other people, and i fuck other people,
you a slut but i'm equal, i'm a mutt,
we're both evil in our ways,
but neither one of us would ever admit it,
cause one of us would have one up on the other,
so forget it,
we can make accusations, people spread rumors,
but they ain't got proof,
'til they do it's just the two of us,
it's you and me, cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
but you gotta believe me to a degree,
cause true indeed if you didn't i wouldn't be hittin' it,
yeah i would cause the sex is too damn good,
if i ran who would i run to,
that would be this soft and warm,
so it's off and on, usually more off than on,
but at least we know that we share this common bond,
you're the only one i can fuck without a condom on,
i hope, the only reason that i cope,
is cause of that fact,
and plus i can bust in that,
and that's why...

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three]</i>
i could never understand it,
that's why i don't try,
from junior high until we both die,
it's silly ho why must we try,
is it really so rough,
that we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
try to pull each other's legs,
until the other begs,
we're liein' to ourselves,
that's the beauty of it yeah,
cause we truly love each other,
that's why we always fight,
and all we do is shove each other,
every other fuckin' night,
and it's clear it ain't gonna change,
it's pent up rage,
we both have,
we both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
we've both been,
someone else's someone else,
problem is neither one wants help,
it's an addiction and it can't be fixed,
our family's mixed up,
there's a baby sister in the mix,
and it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
and anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,
and they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
on every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
all the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
what you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,
but i won't be made a fool of,
if this is true love,
you wouldn't do what,
you did last time,
you wouldn't screw up,
this time,
cause this time girl,
i'm telling you what,
you do it again i'm fucking you up,
no matter what...

<i>[bridge]</i>
what you say, what you do,
i'ma hunt you down 'til i find you,
no matter where you run, i'll be right there,
right behind you, in your nightmares,
all the flowers, and the candy,
all the times that you threw it back at me,
you told me you hate me, you're gonna hate me more,
when you find out, can't escape me whore.

<i>[chorus]</i>


<i>[in a high falsetto voice]</i>
uncle marshall!
will you tell us a bedtime story?
<i>[regular voice]</i>
here we go...

now once upon a time not long ago
there was a little rapper about to blow
but his album came and it was not good
i think it went lead or double copper wood
so the silly little fans they were mislead
by a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"me and you, 'clef, we're gonna make some cash
grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
the ass-whippin' i'm about to administer
to this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
stanabis, little marshall mathers' sister
and in this corner, we have the mister
not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
dr. evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
ex-ll cool j fan from windsor
i'm 'bout to murder little kenny fag keniff-sta
you bastard i ain't wanna have to diss ya
canabis, where the fuck you at? i miss ya!

<i>[chorus]</i>
can-i-bitch, oh can-i-bitch
where for art thou can-i-bitch?
please tell me what happened with
that style that you were rappin' with
can-i-bitch, oh can-i-bitch
are you from los angeles
new york or just a janitor
from canada? oh can-i-bitch

now at first i ain't really understand the shit
picture me for a second and imagine it
chillin' in the bat-mansion and relaxin'
when all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
it's can-i-bitch on some "stan lives" shit
it creeped me out at first. man this is sick
for me, being just a sick, this conflict
gets my dick harder than arithmetic
and i know how you jealous ones envy
i shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
the first two letters you were tellin' me shit
like you respect me, like any other regular mc
the third letter you ask how come i ain't return
none of the messages at shady records you left me 
the fourth letter: "slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
the fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
the sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
this crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
so i went back and read the first few letters that said 
some shit about a message you left 
oh shit, that's not an "e" that's an "a" 
this dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
right away i'm on the phone with dr. dre 
we got a bogey! (marshall i'm on the way) 

<i>[chorus]</i>
can-i-bitch, oh can-i-bitch
where for art thou can-i-bitch?
please tell me what happened with
that style that you were rappin' with
can-i-bitch, oh can-i-bitch
are you from los angeles
new york or just a janitor
from canada? oh can-i-bitch 

so in two seconds flat dre's at my crib 
the funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
and neither one of us have canadian citizenship 
shit. oh dre, wait a mintue that's it 
all we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
we can fly over the border "let's go" <i>[woosh!]</i>
so we're off to toronto and we're gainin' speed 
<i>[boosh!]</i> (what was that? oh) jermaine dupri 
fuck it, keep goin' no time to waste 
wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
oh well, only thirty more thousand miles 
meanwhile me and dre are tryin' to conversate 
just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
and tryin' to figure out what happened to 'germaine propaine' 
"he couldn't have fell off that hard" ain't no way 
"what happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
that canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
plus he raps with his regular voice <i>[boosh! boosh!]</i>
<i>[boosh! boosh!]</i> (what was that?) pet shop boys 
so we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
his corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
he kinda smelled a little like courtney love 
i figure if i stick him with a fork he's done 
so i stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', christ 
he won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
he's like kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
but he won't fight back i cracked his jaw 
hold up, 'bis quit foldin' up! 
punch me in the chest! make my shoulders touch! 
do somethin'! at least one punchline 
c'mon till the meter reads nine-nine-nine-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
intergalatical metaphors from mars! 
raw to the floor, raw like reservoir dogs 
bite another line from redman's song! 
suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
from a midget reaches out from under the car 
it's jd, this motherfucker won't die neither 
dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
we stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(compton!) detroit bitch! talk some shit again! 
stomp him! (switch feet) stomp him! (switch again!) 
dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
i think stanabis jumped off the bridge again (damn)
he disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 

<i>[chorus]</i>
can-i-bitch, oh can-i-bitch
where for art thou can-i-bitch?
please tell me what happened with
that style that you were rappin' with
can-i-bitch, oh can-i-bitch
are you from los angeles
new york or just a janitor
from canada? oh can-i-bitch


yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and i don't see either one of us budging

"i'm withholding my anger
though i'd like to be the strangler
of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
it's my right to insist
that he acknowledge my existence
but he just displays complete lack of respect"
that's what he says to himself
as he use his magazines to trash me
as he sits with both his feet up at his desk
smokes a bag of his weed
and starts imagining things
and he just can't see that he's manically depressed
and in his jealousy and envy
it just whirls him in a frenzy
as he turns on mtv and sees my face
he don't exist in this world
so he just twists and he twirls
spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
and it's destroying him slowly
cause he does not even know me
even though he sees me everywhere he goes
so he just tortures himself
he has no fortune and wealth
so he extorts someone else to get his dough
and now he's acting like a bully
so he tries to push and pull me
but he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
he has no choice but to scream
and raise his voice up at me
cause it annoys him to see that i ain't scared

you ain't no motherfucking (bully)
and i ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
i won't allow it, ain't gonna cower to no (bully)
i'll be damned if i don't stand up to a (bully)
fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
and i know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)

now i'm not trying to make no more enemies
no more unfortunately
there's so many other motherfuckers that just are
they just keep hounding at me
now that i'm down with fifty
suddenly now i got beef with this faggot ja <i>[laughter]</i>
but his ass is such a puppet
irv could shove his whole hand up it
and just make him say what he wants him to say
but suge has irv's on a string
and irv's so nervous that he
says anything to this man to keep him at bay
so now ja thinks that he's so tough
and murder inc.'s the big bad wolf
and they go huff and puff and blow our label down
but our building's made out of bricks
so you ain't taking out shit
and dog you just did a song with bobby brown
so now you try to pull the race card
and it backfires in your face hard
cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
plus this stylist that you fucked
when you was ecstasied up
was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch

you must be taking to much (e...)

now what bothers me the most
about hip-hop is we so close
to picking up where we left off with big and pac
we just lost jam master j
big l got blasted away
plus we lost bugz, slang ton, and freaky tah
it's like a never-ending cycle
that just seems to come full circle
everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
i'm not excluding myself
cause i been stupid as well
i been known to lose it when someone says something smart
but as we grow as men
we learn to let shit go, but then again
there's only so much bullshit we can really stand
we all got reps to uphold
when someone steps on our toes
it's no exception, it goes for every man
but if irv really gave a fuck
about ja like he claims he does
he'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
but he just keeps feeding him pills
so if that e doesn't kill him
someone from g-unit will and i ain't buzzed
dawg, i'm talking to you straight
if the situation escalates
any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
and if i get killed for this rap
i got a million in cash
that says i will get you back in hailie's name

irvine, get your boy off that (e...)

<i>[spoken:]</i>
get at me, dog
holla


good mornin
haha, wake your mother fuckin asses up
yo what is the what?
well come on then, you know what time it is
stop sleepin on my roof bitch

for whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped
cause i'ma have the last lift that ever gets arse squished
i just can't get past these little pissants
that wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
and they so mad they can't stand it
cause we can and they can't spit (haawk)
and they can't handle it like a man
and that's when it just happens
and i snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it?
hip-hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
maybe i'm old fashioned but my pashion 
is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin 
believe me i'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol when i'm pissed now
but it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
cause i'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
cause if i get pushed over the edge then i'm pullin you with me
you poke a stick at a pitbull you get bit b
these words stick to you like crazy glue
when you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
i'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when i'm gone
like kieth murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!!)
i do this for swifty, kon and kuniva, bizzy &amp; proof are you with me?

<i>[swifty]</i>
?? the media pitted me of a beef starter
in a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
fuck slugs i'm walkin gloves with a shotgun
constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run
the bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't concious
in a house full of dog shit, 
i'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin 
you die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
it ain't about what you readin
when you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
either that or we'll be beefin free when 
you ******* need a 'e' just to speak shit!
your leader is a botique bitch
keep the heater where you can reach quick
i snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
****** i did it from a mind of a mental patient
when glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
you brave?

<i>[kuniva]</i>
yo yo i heard you niggas don't like us
but so what this beef is like 
'what tha fuck did he say in his rap em?'
i can see that he's just a punk 
i mean these niggas squeeze on me 
please i'm seeing guts
i don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
am i empty seein them ?? i emtpy out them ?? to fight you 
in front of every reporter that i don't like
no need for metaphores i get yours across when i write
so emotions enough to say "fuck you bitch, and i don't like you, what!" 
i might as well give this up like heavy sales
and just fuck an leave dtwelve and this blunt 
we can't self destruct
i've never felt it this much
come on fellas, get up
we got to fight like bugs last night of his life

who expects nothin' less than r&amp;b coming from that regime
"regime" is a little extreme
neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' marines
ja sold his soul to sing
weave eye-witness team on the tv screen, chase the greed
now that you've embraced the green
don't fuck with the triple beams
you's a motherfuckin' actor, slash pac impersonating rapper
slash billie holiday â how it happen?
artist and repertoire saw him in action
pac assassination, def jam grabbed him
told him, "reenact him, you go platinum!"
they seen it for sure, i know that afeni shakur
don't enjoy jeffrey atkins reenacting her boy
so i'm click-clackin' this toy, mash and destroy
shady slash aftermath and detroit, motherfucker!

and when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one

before the guns stick to the clip
and benzino, you ain't shit but a bitch!
fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
built up, slap you like grimace, all sensitive
wait a minute, hold on: is it me, or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
a bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
with them short ass arms, like a tyrannosaurus rex
you niggas can scream, holler and curse
go ahead and respond
and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

<i>[proof:]</i>
slim didn't send proof to get at the wankstas
he told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
what up, gotti? and this little war you pushed on
put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
what's wrong? didn't think we strong with real niggas?
roll like a boss, in the streets they still feel us
it's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
you talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
contact was blown by benzetta in the source
threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
now irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
but detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

<i>[kon artis:]</i>
word to my nigga bugz, punks like you get beat up
stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
this rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
with dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
who's behind ya? cadillac pac or that transvestite?
that dress like a lil kim fox
you're just like a little windbox
press tight on the trigger of this glock
swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
you knock pac's songs without love to help you sleep
you got shot in your video trying mock pac
you mockaveli; get your own identity!

check, check, check
alright, let's do it
let's go, come on
(eminem, eminem, eminem)


lord, please forgive me for what i do
for i know not what i've done

<i>[verse one:]</i>
momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off
head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
my momma don't want me the next thing i know i'm gettin' dropped off
(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
but they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
(else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn) 'til somebody finally took me in
my great aunt and uncle, edna 'n charles (edna 'n charles
edna 'n charles, edna 'n charles, edna 'n charles)
they were the ones who were left in charge
my elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
it went a little something like
mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
debbie had a satan spawn, satan spawn
momma why do they keep saying this i just don't understand, understand
and by the way, where's my daaaaaaaaaaad?

<i>[verse two:]</i>
predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
predominantly white, predominantly black, but what about me
where does that leave me? well i guess that i'm between predominantly
both of 'em, i think if i hear that fuckin' word again i'mma scream
while i'm projectile vomiting, what do i look like, a comedian to you?
do you think that i'm kidding? what do i look like some kind of idi-
wait a minute, shit, don't answer that - why am i so misunderstood?
why do i go through so much bullshit, it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bisch
woe is me, there goes poor marshall again whinin about his millions
and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
from the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
and how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
man i'd hate to have it, as bad as that mr. mathers, claims he had it
i can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
man if i only had half of it
shit, if you only knew the half of it

<i>[verse three:]</i>
evil deeds, while i plant these evil seeds
please release me from these demons
i never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe
i don't wanna be satan's spawn, never got the chance to say i'm sorry
now look at all the pain i caused
dear santa claus, why you not comin' this year again?
what did i do that was so bad to deserve this?
everything could have been so perfect
but life ain't a fairytale, i'm about to be hoisted up in the air
forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
i don't even know why they feel like they know me cause i'm in this ferris wheel
and all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
without this crowd everywhere i go, but life is like a merry-go-round
here we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go
now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
but the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
where's the switch i could just turn off and on, this ain't what i chose to be
so please god, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'til i pass fifty back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

<i>[chorus xtwo]</i>


<i>[eminem]</i>
there's not much you could do or say to phase me
people think i'm a little bit crazy
i get it from all angles, even occasionally doc dre-zie'll
have to step in every once in a while to save me
to make me stop and think about it 'fore i just say things
sometimes i forget what other people just may think
a lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
if they heard some shit, i'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
i maybe a little too fast paced and racy
sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
cuz i say so many rhymes, it may seem like i'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing
and i could give a fuck what category you place me
long as when i'm pushing up daisies and gone
as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
when i hit the heavenly gates i'll be cool beside jay-z
for every single die hard fan who embraced me
i'm thankful for the talent in which god gave me
and i'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
believe it or not, i thank my mom for how she raised me
in the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me
it only made me what i am today, see
regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
you ain't gonna make or break me
tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, g
you're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
and when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me
you had all this time to think about it
now don't pussy out and try to about face me
cuz i've been patiently waiting for the day
that we finally meet in the same place to see

<i>[chorus xtwo - nate dogg]</i>
no matter how many battles i been in and won
no matter how many magazines on my nuts
no matter how many mc's i eat up
ooh ooh, it's never enough

<i>[fifty cent]</i>
my flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
uh oh, it gets worse when i go back to the basics
you go say the wrong shit and get your face split
the smell of victory, love it so much i can taste it
i spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
graze it, your peace talk, save it
you shit sounds dated, you're overrated
i'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers
if i'm the best and the worst, then god's gift is a curse
soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
i spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
to be specific i go ballistic as hieroglyphic
my music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
chew it or pop it, roll a bag or chop it
get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it
when it's hot, it's hot
your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

<i>[chorus xtwo]</i>


what we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough. if you will to be
saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children. we seem to be approaching an age of the gross. we all have this idea that we should
move up a little bit from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better

all right, come on, let's cut the bullshit enough
let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up
let's take this shit back to the basement
and we can discuss statements that's made on this tape
and its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
the music we all enjoy
the music you accuse me of tryna destroy
let's rewind it to 'eighty-nine when i was a boy on the east side of detroit
crossing eight mile into warren, into hick territory
i'd like to share a story, this is my story and can't nobody tell it for me
you have well informed me, i am well aware that i don't belong here
you've made that perfectly clear, i get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
from bel-air shopping center just for stopping in there
from the black side all the way to the white side
ok there's a bright side a day that i might slide
you may call it a pass i call it hauling my ass
through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
them good old notorious so well-known tracks

so let's go back
follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home

come on let's go back
follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home

i'd roam the streets so much they'd call me a drifter
sometimes i'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
just to get picked up to get me a lift to eight mile and van dyke
and steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard
and drop it off at the park that was the half-way mark
to meet kim had to walk back to her mama's on chalmers after dark
to sneak me in the house when i'm kicked out my mom's
that's about the time i first met proof with goofy gary on the steps
at osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doing some talent shows
at center line high, i had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
he looked at me like i'm out my mind shook his head like, "white boys don't know how to rhyme."
i spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place"
and we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
we was on the same shit that big daddy kane shit where compound syllables sound combined
from that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

so let's go back
follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home

come on let's go back
follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home

my first year in nineth grade, can't forget that day at school
it was cool 'til your man mc shan came through
and said that puma's the brand 'cause the klan makes troops
it was rumors but man, god damn, they flew
must've been true because man we done banned they shoes
i had the new ones the cool j, ice lamb suede too
but we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
guess who came through next, x-clan debut
professor x vanglorious exists in a state of red, black, and green
with a key sissies now with this being a new trend
we don't fit in crackers is out with cactus albums
blackness is in, african symbols and medallions
represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
me and my man howard and butta would go to the mall with 'em
all over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all
we was being laughed at "you ain't even half black."
you ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
and that flavor flav clock we gon' have to snatch that
all i remember is meeting back at manix's basement
saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the x clan's tape is
which reminds me back in 'eighty-nine me and kim broke up for the first time
she was tryna two-time me and there was this black girl
at our school who thought i was cool 'cause i rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
and oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus
the same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
the bombest god damn girl in our whole school if i could pull her
not only would i become more popular but i would be able to piss kim off at the same time
but it backfired i was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
and that's the last i ever seen or heard or spoke to the "oh foolish pride" girl
but i've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
but it was i singled out a whole race and for that i apologize
i was wrong 'cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe

so let's go back
follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home

come on let's go back
follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home


step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down...

<i>[chorus]</i>
step by step, heart to heart, left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

<i>[verse one]</i>
i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
even if it means goin' toe to toe with a benzino it don't matter
i'd never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to
i'm supposed to set an example
i need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever does pop off, i'm supposed to be beside 'em
that ja shit i tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
there's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy, this shit went way beyond some jay-z and nas shit
and even though the battle was won, i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it, honestly i'm exhausted
and i'm so caught in it i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this ain't what i'm in hip-hop for, it's not why i got in it
that was never my object for someone to get killed
why would i wanna destroy something i help build
it wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
i went through my whole career without ever mentionin'
and that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
and talkin' about something that i knew nothing about
plus dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
so i did, i just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
while he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
like fuck it i understand this is business
and this shit just isn't none of my business
but still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse two]</i>
there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
and wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
but now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
it's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
we actually tried to stop the fifty and ja beef from happenin'
me and dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
until ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
fuck it fifty smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
well fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
but i'm so busy being pissed off i don't stop to think
that we just inherited fifty's beef with murder inc.
and he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
we still have soldiers that's on the front line
that's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
we'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
to show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
to have runyan avenue, soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
but i ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
it ain't worth it, i can't think of a perfecter way to word it
then to just say that i love ya'll too much to see the verdict
i'll walk away from it all before i let it go any further
but don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that i'm coppin'
i'm just willin' to be the bigger man
if ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then i can
cause frankly i'm sick of talkin'
i'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause

<i>[chorus]</i>


i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america
and to the republic for which it stands
one nation under god
indivisible with liberty and justice for all...

people, it feels so good to be back...
mosh with me now!

i scrutinize every word, memorize every line
i spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind
i give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
i exercise my right to express when i feel it's time

it's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
i say to fight, you take it as i'mma whip someone's ass
if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
a father who has grown up with a fatherless past

who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
and in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts

who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
of his career typical manure moving past that
mr. kiss-his-ass-crack, he's a class act
rubber-band man, yeah, he just snaps back

come along follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
carry on, give me hope, give me strength
come with me and i won't steer you wrong

put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel
we gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march
through the swamp, we gon' mosh through the marsh
take us right through the doors
(c'mon)

all the people up top on the side and the middle
come together let's all form and swarm just a little
just let it gradually build from the front to the back
all you can see is a sea of people some white and some black

don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
to celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
if it rains let it rain, yeah, the wetter the better
they ain't gon' stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever

they tell us, "no," we say, "yeah," they tell us, "stop," we say, "go."
rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gon' let 'em know
stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck bush,
until they bring our troops home
c'mon, just

come along follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
carry on, give me hope, give me strength
come with me and i won't steer you wrong

put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel
we gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march
through the swamp, we gon' mosh through the marsh
take us right through the doors
(c'mon)

imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
mosh pits outside the oval office
someone's tryna tell us something,
maybe this is god just sayin' we're responsible
for this monster, this coward,
that we have empowered

this is bin laden, look at his head noddin'
how could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
now this is our final hour

let me be the voice and your strength, and your choice
let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six...
teen million people, all equal at this high pitch

maybe we can reach al-qaeda through my speech
let the president answer a higher anarchy
strap him with an ak-forty-seven, let him go, fight his own war
let him impress daddy that way

no more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
no more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal

if we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
look in his eyes it's all lies
the stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
and replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
if i get sniped tonight you know why,
'cause i told you to fight.

come along follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
carry on, give me hope, give me strength
come with me and i won't steer you wrong

put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel
we gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march
through the swamp, we gon' mosh through the marsh
take us right through the doors
(c'mon)

and as we proceed,
to mosh through this desert storm,
and these closing statements, if they should argue
let us beg to differ
as we set aside our differences
and assemble our own army
to disarm this weapon of mass destruction
that we call our president, for the present
and mosh for the future of our next generation
to speak and be heard
mr. president, mr. senator
do you guys hear us... hear us?


<i>[sounds of someone puking]</i>

there i go--thinking of you again

<i>[chorus]</i>
you don't know how sick you make me
you make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
every time i think of you, i puke
you must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
you may not think you do, but you do
every time i think of you i puke

i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
but off of the dome would probably be a little more, more suitable for this type of song--whoa
i got a million reasons off the top of my head that i could think of
sixteen bars, this ain't enough to put some ink ta
so fuck it, i'ma start right here i'll just be brief i'm
bout to rattle off some of the reasons
i knew i shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you
on my arm, but what do i go and do
i go and get another one, now i got two
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
now i'm sittin' here with your name on my skin
i can't believe i went and did this stupid shit again
my next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be kim
shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it
if you only knew how much i hated you
for every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through
then i wouldn't be standing here crying over you
boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-who

<i>[chorus]</i>
you don't know how sick you make me
you make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
every time i think of you, i puke
you must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
you may not think you do, but you do
every time i think of you i puke

i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
but i thought a song would probably be a little better
instead of a letter
that you'd probably just shred up--yeah
i stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
how much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta, a stupid piece a
paper, i'd rather let you see how
much i fuckin' hate you in a freestyle
you're a fuckin' coke-head slut, i hope you fuckin' die
i hope you get to hell and satan sticks a needle in your eye
i hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut, i hope you die
di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie
but please don't get me wrong, i'm not bitter or mad
it's not that i still love you, it's not 'cause i want you back
it's just that when i think of you, it makes me wanna
gag-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag
what else can i do, i haven't got a clue
now i guess i'll just move on, i have no choice but to
but every time i think of you now all i wanna do
is pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke

<i>[chorus]</i>
you don't know how sick you make me
you make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
every time i think of you, i puke
you must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
you may not think you do, but you do
every time i think of you, i puke

yeah
(definitely, definitely, definitely, dope, definitely, definitely k-mart)
yeah, yeah

<i>[eminem (dr. dre):]</i>
you find me offensive, i find you offensive
for finding me offensive
hence, if i should draw the line on any fences
if so to what extent
if at any should i go
'cause it's getting expensive
being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
they say i cause extensive
psychological nerve damage to the brain when i go to lengths this,
far at other peoples' expenses
i say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
it's censorship
and it's down right blasphemous
let's end this shit now 'cause i won't stand for this
and christopher reeves won't sit for this neither
and let's clear this up too i ain't got no beef with him either
he used to be like a hero to me
i even believe i had one of those twenty-five cent stickers on my refrigerator
right next to darth vader
and darth must have put a hex on him for later
i feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
i stuck him up in between him and lex luthor
i killed superman, i killed super--man
and how ironic, that i'd be the bad guy
kryptonite: the green chronic

now in the bible it says
thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed,
have homosexual sex
unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
then, of course, it's intercourse
and it's bi-sexual sex
which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
either before, during or after performing the act of that which
is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases
that are more used by today's kids
in a more derogatory way but
who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
let's ask dr. dre
dr. dre? (what up?)
i gotta question if i may? (yeah)
is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (yeah)
and watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (yeah)
but, up i ain't done yet
in football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
while he reaches in another grown man's ass
grabs on his nuts but just what if
it was never meant it was just an accident
but he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
his teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
and i don't mean to go in into any more details but
what if he pictured it as a females butt?
is that gay? i just need to clear things up
'til then i'll just walk around with a manly strut because...

<i>[chorus]</i>

you find me offensive, i find you offensive
shit, this is the same verse i just did this
when am i gonna come to my good senses?
probably the day bush comes to my defenses
my spider sense is telling me spiderman is nearby
and my plan is to get him next
and open up a whip-ass canister
goddamn it dre where's the god damn beat? (yeah)
anyway, anyway i don't know how else to put it
this is the only thing that i'm good at
i am the bad guy, kryptonite: the green chronic
demonic, yep yep, don't worry i'm on it
i got it, high five nick lachey
stuck a pin in jessica's head and walked away
and as she flew around the room like a balloon
i grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
out the trash can and zoom
i headed straight back to the neverland ranch
with a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
and i ain't even gotta make no god damn sense
i just did a whole song and i didn't say shit

<i>[chorus]</i>
cause iiiaaaaaaaahhhhhhhahahaaa aaaaahahhhhhhhhhh
yo, rain man
definitely, definitely dr. dre super dope beat maker two thousand and
two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
and seventy (yeah)


i don't understand
why are you being so mean?
you're a mean mean man

you are just jealous of me
'cause you, you just can't do what i do
so instead of just admitting it
you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things
about me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
but it's only 'cause you're
just really jealous of me
'cause i'm what you want to be
so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things
'cause it's too easy to see
you're really just a big weenie, big weenie

alright listen, i need you to focus
i need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
we are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
i'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
now i need you to open your mind-your eyes close them
you are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
for the next four and a half minutes
we are going to explore into your mind
to find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
now why did they make yoo-hoo?
pippity ga-ga poo-poo
psych, i'm kidding
i just wanted to see if you're still listenin'
ok, now i need your undivided attention
sir i have a question
why do i always sense this undeniable tension
from the moment that i enter into the room
it gets all quiet and whispers
whenever there's conversation, why am i always mentioned?
i've been dying to ask, it's been itchin' at me
is it just because

you are just jealous of me
'cause you, you just can't do what i do
so instead of just admitting it
you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things
about me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
but it's only 'cause you're
just really jealous of me
'cause i'm what you want to be
so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things
'cause it's too easy to see
you're really just a big weenie, big weenie

alright now i (shit) i just flubbed a line
i was going to say something extremely important
but i forgot who or what it was, i fucked up
psych, i'm kidding again you idiot, no i didn't
that's just what you wanted to hear from me
is that i fucked up ain't it?
but i can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
it doesn't take a bunch of takes
or me to stand here in this booth all day
for me to say the truth, ok?
you're drooling, you have tooth decay
your mouth is open, you're disgusting
what the fuck you eat for lunch
a bunch of sweets or something, what?
you munch a bunch of crunch 'n munch?
your tooth is rotten to the gum
your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
yes i do sir, what am i on?
you sir are on truth serum
marshall i'm so jealous of you
please say you won't tell nobody
i'd be so embarrassed, i'm just absolutely terrified
that someone's gonna find out why i'm saying
all these terrible, evil and awful mean things
it's my own insecurities!

you are just jealous of me
'cause you, you just can't do what i do
so instead of just admitting it
you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things
about me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
but it's only 'cause you're
just really jealous of me
'cause i'm what you want to be
so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things
'cause it's too easy to see
you're really just a big weenie, big weenie

alright now we, we're going to conduct
that experiment that we were talking about earlier
just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
wait, let me put these sun glasses on
now look in this mirror, how about now?
what do you have in common?
you're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
you look like i sound like singing about weenies
now take my weenie out of your mouth
this is between me and you, i know you're not happy
i know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
there is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
why do we have to keep on going through this, this is torturous
my point is this
that if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
now i forgot what the chorus is, you're just a

you are just jealous of me
'cause you, you just can't do what i do
so instead of just admitting it
you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things
about me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
but it's only 'cause you're
just really jealous of me
'cause i'm what you want to be
so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things
'cause it's too easy to see
you're really just a big weenie, big weenie

fuck off my dick!

<i>[eminem:]</i>
if there's any bitches in this room, then there's something i gotta say
for all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
i've been down that road and now i'm back, sittin' on square one
tryna pick myself up where i started from

<i>[obie trice:]</i>
i never woulda thought that i'd see you outta control
even though my penis was deep down in your hole
you should know between us we was like mates to soul
nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
you was more so the chalant type, i chose
to more shows, haunted you nights i suppose
that's how we go, with time spent, emotion grows
in the beginning, friends we decided to roll
so who's responsible when you get excited, explode
and obie's grinning, then you invite that obie's cold
but bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
we established this way before we became mates
so what's required is that you chill with all that fire
get your desire when i retire

spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right 'cause you just crossed the line
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i used to say i never met a girl like you before
still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
can't believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
if you recall i used to treat you like a groupie broad
when we fucked i refused to even take my jewelry off
but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off
it was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
you started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
and the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
and who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
cupid could shoot another one of them god damn darts at me
it's true that i got shot in the heart
but when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
but see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
'til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
before you make a decision that's life altering
and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
you hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right 'cause you just crossed the line
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

<i>[stat quo:]</i>
in most cases, stat's attitude is fuck-a-bitch
my only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
but you was different, thought we shared a covenant
even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this
shorty on some whole 'notha other shit
tryna play slick thinkin' i'mma trick off grip
i'll admit, i was caught in the mix, down to commit
feeding you the best of me, i shoulda fed you piss
we started off closer than close
but who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth
and the final result, back in that same boat
i asked myself, do i love these hoes? no!

<i>[fifty cent:]</i>
em introduced us, "fifty this is tanya, tanya this is fifty"
then slid off and left her to kick it with me
i complimented her, i said you have very nice lips
with my imagination, i could see her suckin' my dick
we played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
downtown manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
penthouse full of imported shit, you know how i grind
she got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
yeah, yeah, know how many times i done heard that shit?

spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right 'cause you just crossed the line
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine


yeah
i know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
but hey, what daddy always tell you?
straighten up little soldier
stiffen up that upper lip
what you crying about?
you got me.

hailie, i know you miss your mom, and i know you miss your dad
when i'm gone but i'm trying to give you the life that i never had
i can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'cause you're scared, i ain't there?
daddy's with you in your prayers
no more crying, wipe them tears
daddy's here, no more nightmares
we gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
lainie uncle's crazy, ain't he?
yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
we're all we got in this world
when it spins, when it swirls
when it whirls, when it twirls
two little beautiful girls
lookin' puzzled, in a daze
i know it's confusing you
daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that, the more it backfires on me
all the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see
daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us
i don't see us ever being together ever again
like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be
but it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
but no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

now hush little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise mama's gon' be alright

(ha)
it's funny
i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up
and stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying
'cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in
either kept getting broken into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
on the chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of eight mile on novara
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd and met dr. dre
and flew you and momma out to see me
but daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
then you started seeing daddy on the t.v. and momma didn't like it
and you and lainnie were too young to understand it
papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
wow, i guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
lainnie i'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
i like the sound of that, yeah
it's got a ring to it don't it?
shh, mama's only gone for the moment

now hush little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise mama's gon' be alright

and if you ask me to
daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
i'mma give you the world
i'mma buy a diamond ring for you
i'mma sing for you
i'll do anything for you to see you smile
and if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
i'mma break that birdie's neck
i'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
and make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)


tell myself that i was doing alright
there's nothing left to do tonight
but go crazy on you
crazy on you
let me go crazy, crazy on you

can't you see what you do to me baby?
you make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac.
i'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
you're truly the only one who can do this to me
you just make me get so crazy.

i go schizo, i get so insane i just go schizophrenic
one minute i wanna slit your throat, the next i wanna sex
you make me crazy,
the way we act
like two maniacs in the sack
we fuck like two jackrabbits
and maybe that's a bad habit.

'cause the next day we're right back at it
in the same exact pattern
what the fuck is the matter with us?
we can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
what's that that's attracting us to each other?
they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.

which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
but i stay and still stick it out with you even though i just hit you today
but you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
just 'cause i came home late last night crawled in bed and i woke you.

but if there's one thing about you that i admire it's, baby,
because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as i am
'cause when i look at you i can see an angel in your eyes
but if i look deeper inside i see your freakish little side.

like a devil in disguise,
you're always full of surprises
always pullin' devices
out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
you fucked yourself so much
you barely feel those anymore
you're only twenty-four but you're plenty more mature
than those other little hoes
who just act like little girls
like they're in middle school still
you're crazy sexy cool,

chilling you play your position
you never step out of line
even though i stay in your business
you've always kept out of mine.

i wonder what's on your mind
sometimes they say love is blind
maybe that's why the first time i dotted your eye
you ain't see the sign.

or maybe you did
maybe you like being shoved
maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

crazy on you
crazy on you
let me go crazy crazy on you

you are the ink to my paper
what my pen is to my pad
the moral, the very fiber
the whole substance to my rap.

you are my reason for being
the meaning of my existence
if it wasn't for you
i would never be able to spit this
as intense as i do and the irony
is you rely on me as much
as i rely on you to inspire me like you do.

you provide me the lighter fluid
you're fuel to my fire
you're my entire supply
gas, the match and igniter.

the only way that i am able
to stay so stable
is you're the legs to my table
if you were to break i'd fall on my face.

but i'm always gonna make you feel
i don't need you as much as i really need you
so you don't use it to your advantage.

but you're essential to me
you're the air i breathe
i believe if you ever leave me
i'd probably have no reason to be.

you are the kim to my marshall
you're the slim to my shady
the dre to my eminem
the alaina to my hailie.

you are the word that i'm looking for when
i'm trying to describe how i feel inside
and the right one just won't come to my mind.

you're like the pillar that props me up
the beam that supports me
the bitch who never took half,
the wife who never divorced me.

you're like the root to my evil
you let my devil come out me
you let me beat the shit out you
before you beat the shit out me.

and no matter how much
too much is never enough
maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

crazy on you
crazy on you
let me go crazy crazy on you

i've never seen no shit like this in my life before
people are still camped out from the night before
sleeping outside the door waiting in line

the fire marshals know the venue's too small
people are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans
and some cum-wad from out the parking lot
gets in an argument over a parking spot
decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of 'em off
missed who he's aiming for six feet away's the door
into st. andrew's hall
now the strays flying all over the place
grazed one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall
before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
i'm posted up at the bar having a mazel tov
bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
thank god i'm alive i gotta find denaun
and where the fuck is von? he usually tucks one on him
wait a minute i think i just saw bizarre
nah i guess not, what the fuck oh my god it was
i never saw him run so fast in my life
look at him hauling ass i think he left his wife
there she is on the ground being trampled
i go to grab her up by the damn hand but i can't pull her
god damn there just went another damn bullet i'm hit
my vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin
if i get hit again i can't do it, i scoop dee
follow bizarre's path ran through it
made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
looked up and i seen swift shooting it out
but i can't see who he's shooting it out with
but denaun's right behind him squeezing his four-fifth

<i>[eminem:]</i>
one shot two shot three shots four shots
all i hear is gunshots
this is where the fun stops
bodies drop, hit the floor
music's off, party stops
everybody hit the door

<i>[kon artis:]</i>
it's friday night came to this bitch right
big ass in my left hand, desert eagle in my right
i ain't come in this bitch to party i came in this bitch to fight
although i can't stay here to fight 'cause i'm popping niggas tonight
that's right bitches i'm drunk with revenge
shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when i get in
swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that this schmuck
that shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
so one shot for the money two's to stop the show
third's for the bartender
(bitch bring me a bottle of mo')
i just wanna know who's driving the black mitsubishi
he tried to run so proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

<i>[eminem:]</i>
one shot two shot three shots four shots
all i hear is gunshots
this is where the fun stops
bodies drop, hit the floor
music's off, party stops

<i>[fifty cent]</i>
sh-sh-sh-shady
aftermath, haha
g-g-g-g-g-unit!, haha

<i>[chorus]</i>
cause we came here to set this party off right
let's bounce tonight
and if they don't let us in through the front
we'll come through the side
cuz i don't ever wanna leave the game without
at least saying goodbye
so all my people on the left, all my people on the right
swing one last time

<i>[eminem]</i>
get your ass up for the doctor
one more time, get your ass up for the doctor
come on now, here we go
cliff hanger, it's another club banger
got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
get on down

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
times up, games over, you lose, i win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
look who's got you goin' crazy again
i'm a trend, i set one every time i'm in
i go out and just come back full circle again
you a fad, that means your something that we already had
but once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

<i>[eminem]</i>
you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
we stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
you walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
we walk around just playin' the violin behind you
enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
world-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
when dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
crunk, crunk, crunk
and when fifty cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
jump, jump, jump, jump

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
the buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
i don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

<i>[eminem]</i>
we keep the party rockin' off the henges
we ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
but critics say that doc is soft, doc is talk
doc is all washed up, knock it off
who the fuck is doc impressin'?
doc is this, doc is that, you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cock of doc, cuz doc left you all guessin'
so dj take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
we gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
that's why we always save the best cut last
to make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

<i>[eminem]</i>
cuz we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
maybe raised to be racist
who may have never got to see our faces
grace the cover of rolling stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the cape crusaders
and leave it to me and dre to pass the mic
and we can play the back and forth all day
like the hot potato game, thats why we came to

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
fifty cent, come on!

<i>[fifty cent]</i>
bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
we make the club jump everywhere we go
it's no secret, everybody know
when dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
and plenty honey's involved, the sunny sunday's and palm trees
cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
all the way to them eight mile alleys, let's rally

<i>[eminem]</i>
hands up for the grand finale
now raise up out your seat, dre is about to speak
blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
you could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

<i>[eminem]</i>
so never say never cuz shady aftermath together
along with g-unit records presents the return of the-the doc (and shady)
no one could do it better
we tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
yeah, haha
still aftermath, two thousand and six
and don't worry about that detox album
it's comin', we gonna make dre do it, haha
fifty cent, g-unit, obie trice, d-twizzy, stat quo, dr. dre
we ain't leavin', let's go! haha
ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for comin' out, peace!
oh shit, i almost forgot
you're comin' with me <i>[gun shots]</i>
haha, bye bye!
see you in hell, fuckers.


once you call my name out things will never be the same....
they should have never let us get off foot in this game...
ever since i was introduced to rap music
i been missing a screw like bishop and juice
i could lose it at any moment
those who know me know it
so they're probably told you go with the flow
just so that i don't explode
and have another episode where i let it go as far as
the one with benzino did i'm waiting for that next beef,
i'm cocked, locked and loaded
i'm ready to go so bad i'm going bananas,
my dick's so hard anna nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
oh shit, i mean when she was still bloated
before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it
anybody i throw flames at gets a name it's a game
cause they know that they don't spit the same
it's a shame, what people do for ten minutes of fame
everyday it's the same thing,
people in this game try to buddy buddy us
just to get close enough to study us
everybody just wants to have something to do with that
they all trying to get that stamp
they after that shady - aftermath money
it's like a monopoly
they probably just now finally understand how to rob fully
fifty cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
and dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
and a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
when we rhyme with each other
in time we discovered that we have more in common
then we thought with each other
both robbed of our mothers
our fathers ain't want us
what was wrong with us, was it our fault
cause we started thinking god doesn't love us
two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
what a coincidence cause when fifty got shot up in jamaica queens
i still remember the call up in ??
big l had just got popped just a month before
if fifty lives he's getting dropped from columbia
two years later me and doc had to come and, uh, operate
that's when he popped up a number one
and we ain't never gonna stop if you wond-ering
even if i'm under the gun
you ain't gotta agree all the time with me
or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and i
but see the difference is if it is i could give a shit
still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
ego's aside, fore i bruise em' all
swallow your pride fore i step on it with shoes you call nike's
earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats
stomping, i been romping since tim dogg was hollering
'fuck compton'
i was whilin', free styling back when they was still making maxell cassettes
i wasn't even raps elvis yet
that tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit
ricky-ticky-toc-ticky-ticky-toc
still with the diggy-diggy-doc-diggy-diggy-doc
and you don't stop


<i>[footsteps and a belch are heared]</i>
whoooo!!!
hey, how you guys doin.
you want more?
alright, then shut up!!!

look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
would you capture it, or just let it slip?

yo! his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already: mom's spaghetti
he's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
he's choking, how? everybody's joking now
the clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!
snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
there goes rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
he knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you betterâ¦

his soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking, make me king
as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring; but superstardom's
close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
these hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
he's known as the globetrotter, lonely roads
god only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
these hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
is told, it unfolds, i suppose it's old, partner
but the beat goes on: da da dum da dum da da da da

you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you betterâ¦

no more games, i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
i've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i can't get by with my nine-to-five
and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
and there's no movie, there's no mekhi phifer, this is my life
and these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
gotten me to the point i'm like a snail, i've got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
mom, i love you, but this trailer's got
to go; i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got

you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you betterâ¦

you can do anything you set your mind to, man


<i>[intro - eminem ]</i>
shady, aftermath
(look at that bitch! ha, yeah!)

i ain't leavin' without you bitch

coming home with me

and my boy, and his boy, and his boy, and his girl

ha ha, nate dogg

<i>[deep breathing]</i>


yeah...
it's my life...
in my own words i guess...

have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
when they know they're your heart
and you know you were their armour
and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
but what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
and everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
what happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"daddy, look what i made", dad's gotta go catch a plane
"daddy, where's mommy? i can't find mommy where is she?"
i don't know go play, hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
i'll give you one underdog and you gotta swing by yourself
then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
and put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
that's slim shady, yeah, baby, slim shady's crazy
shady made me, but tonight shady's rock-a-by baby...

and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing,
so, baby, don't feel no pain
just smile back
and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing,
so, baby, don't feel no pain
just smile back...

i keep having this dream, i'm pushin' hailie on the swing
she keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"you're making mommy cry, why? why is mommy crying?"
baby, daddy ain't leaving no more. "daddy, you're lying.
you always say that, you always say this is the last time
but you ain't leaving no more, daddy, you're mine."
she's piling boxes in front of the door tryna block it
"daddy, please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it!"
goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
it's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe, daddy, take it with you."
i look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
these fucking walls must be talking, 'cause man i can hear 'em
they're saying, "you've got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight.
now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late."
and just as i go to walk out of my bedroom door
it turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
and i'm singing...

and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing,
so, baby, don't feel no pain
just smile back
and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing,
so, baby, don't feel no pain
just smile back...

sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
the curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
i take a bow and thank you all for coming out
they're screaming so loud, i take one last look at the crowd
i glance down, i don't believe what i'm seeing
"daddy, it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding."
but, baby, we're in sweden, how did you get to sweden?
"i followed you, daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'.
"you lied to me, dad, and now you made mommy sad.
and i bought you this coin, it says 'number one dad'.
that's all i wanted, i just wanna give you this coin.
i get the point. fine. me and mommy are going."
but, baby, wait.
"it's too late, dad, you made your choice.
now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us."
that's what they want, they want you marshall
they keep screamin' your name
it's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
yeah, i bet you you will. you rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
i hear applause, all this time i couldn't see
how could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?
i turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
put it to my brain, scream, "die shady!" and pop it
the sky darkens, my life flashes,
the plane that i was supposed to be on crashes
and burns to ashes
that's when i wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
it's spring and hailie's outside swinging,
i walk right up to kim and kiss her
tell her i miss her,
hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
almost as if to say

and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing,
so, baby, don't feel no pain
just smile back
and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing,
so, baby, don't feel no pain
just smile back...

strapped with a grenade, in the pool with your mama
attack her by the legs then i pull her to the bottom
twist nothin up like a condom
slap it if you fuckers got a problem
when i see them, you hoes ending up in a fuckin mausoleum
or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold bm
pull in the garage while you screamin

i haven't had sex since i met her
i'm to busy fucking, your twelve year old baby sitter
and all women ain't shit

<i>[eminem:]</i>
my adolescent years weren't shit 'till what i do now
i never grew up i was born grown, and grew down
the older i get, the dumber the shit, i get in
the more ignorant, the incident, is i fit in
ignoring the shit how boring it gets
when there's no one to hit
i don't know when to quit throwing a fit
i know i'm a bit flaky but they make me
it's they who raised me and say the can take me
it's they who legs i brake and make achy
it's they who mistake me and make me so angry
(i'll shit on you!) i'll spit on you
start pissing and do the opposite on you
you weren't listening, i said i'll cop a squat on you
start spilling my guts like chicken cordon blew and
straight shit like notorious b.i.g. did to that bitch
on his skit on his last album
pull my pants down and...

if you gon' give me the pussy
i'll un-loosen my belt (i'll shit on you!)
i'll punch your daddy not, your mom's kinda cock
your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
buck fifty cross your neck
floss your teck, i'll beat you with it across your chest

<i>[kuniva:]</i>
it's only right i jack your car keys and run
spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
for fun, when i'm drunk
i'll run a truck through the weed house
jump out and beat your peeps down worst than steve stout
put you in chokeholds i learned last week
from the police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(hey, hey, hey!)
i see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
that's like d-bo fightin peablo bryson (i'll shit on you)
so what you hollering and yelling about

with a poisonous sting

my disk slips and disconnects
'till i walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
but still shit on the first bitch who disrespects

over reaction is my only reaction
which only sets off a chain reaction
and puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
a rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
and spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too <i>[bullets spray]</i>
a lot of people say misoginistic which is true
i can't deny it matter of fact i stand by it

boy girl dog woman man child
i'll shit on you!

i will sit on you i don't care who you are


<i>[jay-z:]</i>
motherfuckers say that i'm foolish, i only talk about jewels (bling bling)
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
see, i'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
that same dude you gave nothing, i made something doing
what i do, through and through
and i give you the news with a twist
it's just his ghetto point of view
the renegade you been afraid
i penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block
where they pop toasters, and they live with their moms
got dropped roadsters, from botched robberies niggas crouched over
mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
no, he's not around now how that sound to ya, jot it down
i'll bring you through the ghetto without riding round
hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in their ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it?
i help them see they way through it, not you.
can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt.

<i>[eminem:]</i>
since i'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i ain't no politician but i'll kick it with 'em a minute
'cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits i'll wear it
but if it don't, then ya'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now who's the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics?
who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics?
using his music to steer it sharing his views and his merits
but there's a huge interference, they're saying, "you shouldn't hear it."
maybe it's hatred i spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
maybe it's beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but i'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in america
as a motherfucking drug addict like you didn't experiment?
nah hah, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
and i got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fucking do-gooders â too bad you couldn't do-good at marriage!
and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i don't
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
'cause here we go, he's jigga durra jigga da chk jigga
and i'm the sinister, mr. kiss-my-ass is just the

pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
gotta vent, lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench
what you hollering? gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
by the bodega, iron under my coat, feeling braver
doo-rag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope
do not step to me i'm awkward, i box lefty an orphan
my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
could not stress to me i wasn't grown, especially on nights
i brought something home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor thirty years my senior
my childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up
raising my fingers to critics, raising my head to the sky
big i did it multi before i die (nigga)
no lie, just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight.

shady, we're back

<i>[verse one - eminem]</i>

nothin' can stop and nothin' can change it
you better just make new living arrangements,
if you think your the top and king of the castle
you about to get thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
all i hear is, i'm best at this an i'm best at that,
but i don't hear my name no man brought up in rap
and i don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
but when they say one of the best, i'm nowhere thought of as that
not even the same league as jay-z
nas, pac, biggie or maybe they'll name me
somewhere down at the bottom right after az
or say "he ripped that biggie verse or that jay-z
yo, his verses were crazy on that renegade beat
but i ain't never bought no whole cd of shady
and i all i hear is pop tunes come on the rad-i-o
and they play 'em twenty times in a row daily"
and that very well may be the same reason they don't say me
when they speak on hip-hop legends which has amazed me
cause i thought the formula was to hit mainstream
and make it big-big-big-big-b-baby

<i>[verse two - obie trice]</i>

so maybe the eighty's made me crazy, i been tryin' to get my weight
up since the a slim shady gave me the gate key, paid the ways
so lately mind state's get better each day, replay my relay race

<i>[verse one - eminem]</i>

there's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
and it's the, most sinister duo in the business
once again its the, illest and realest killas
the most villainous dre protege, shady apprentice
drop them zeros and get with these heroes
do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
not over 'till we say it's finished and g-unit spinners
will keep spinnin', this is hip hop when it's in it's
truest form, the greatest, hate us or love us
make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us
thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
the trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
and as sick as his music is, or was, still is
whatever, forever, he will be the illest
to ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
he's already reconciled with his ex <i>[reversed]</i>, a chainsaw and an axe
jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
while we have sex while bill clinton plays the sax
i sprays the vex, yeah bring shady on back
the maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
resurrect, i never left, baby i'm bad
i've gone mad, my comrade dre-zy automatically
he says i'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
i may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
in fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
i ever do spit, i'll never do shit, that's that
fuck it i quit, suck on a dick, jackass
i'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass

<i>[verse two - fifty cent]</i>

nah, em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass, to clean parts, to shitty parts,
my bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the fif'll tell you're ass apart!
a game in this game, crush a motherfuckers free start,
shady paid me, shady crazy, fifty crazy rich, bitch,
different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick,
teflon wrapped on, case i get clapped on,
d's searching the whip, glad i left the mac home,
still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows,
you rocking wit the kid to spit sicker sick flows,
i carried game's style for nine months and gave birth to it,
now i'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it,
e'eryday dre day, front and cause a maylay,
turn the town upside down with a frown upside down,
i smile through summan' fowl, and watch my money pile,
i'm fuckin' with strict stacks, i'm kickin' you stripped fats,
i hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back!

<i>[hook - fifty cent (eminem)]</i>

when me and fif got together to do this music
the more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
it's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
but this shit is new gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
when there's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
if there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
it usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
and wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
and let it go to whoever's holding the most current beef on their shoulders
and their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
but tonight, we ain't coming here to beef with nobody
we came to party, banks, ca$his and mr. ferrari

see if you don't brag, then i don't brag
i know i'm bad, as long as i know i'm bad
i don't need y'all to co-sign no shit

a little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah

if i tell you twice, then i won't be so nice
if you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
they wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit
knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it
cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit
and get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
but the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
and i'm just like 'why your tryna fight momentum'
we just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
shady limited's in any size yo, denim

<i>[intro-eminem]</i>
big proof, rest in peace dudey, we love you,
we just wanna keep making you proud, heh...

<i>[proof]</i>
my life is trapped in these lines,
thats why i'm packing these nines,
i got a rap i ain't diein',
thats in the back of my mind,
got a strap made of iron,
cant relax on this grind,
bending over backwards for these slackers
til i'm snapping my spine,
natural high...i gotta focus,
on these bogus pochers,
looking over my shoulder,
proof get it poppin like show'd a hold up,

<i>[eminem]</i>
we nothing but soldiers!!!
<i>[proof]</i>
slow up!
<i>[eminem]</i>
this gun is loaded!!!
<i>[proof]</i>
roll up!
<i>[eminem]</i>
they beef 'n we leaving 'em coked up!!!

<i>[proof]</i>
if em say it i spray it,
if he will it i kill it,
we kilpatrick 'n ill it,
yo detroit, know i can feel it,
will at this gun on my waiste-line,
at war we don't waste time,
blow up magic cant take a punch,
and fifty can take nine, (blaow!!),
we got schoolcraft here at the seven-eight and dexter,
i'm up 'n holla spending dollars ain't feeling no pressure,
yes suh', ya texta' is bitch...
bet'chya ya flinch when proof shoot up they crew
and wet ya whole clique...


i sense someones tapping into my phones why do
i got this feeling in my bones i might die soon
the f.b.i might be tryin to pull my file soon
i might be walking blind fold into a typhoon
i might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
right outside of the window of my living room
and if they do you can say goodnight and bye bye to them itunes
if i don't try to record as much before i do
the plan is to have as many in the can as i can
as i stand before you in this booth a walking deadman
blank stare dead pan look as my face as i gaze into space
as i wait to be scooped up in that van
mysteriously disappear into thin air
and they gon' say a sniper just appeared out of no where
and i'll go down in the history as the blood sucking leech
who hid behind the freedom of speech
tryed to take the fifth amendment use it, twist it and bend it
and ended up dying to fill out in the heros splinters (?)
the business way to end this i can feel the tremors tremendous
in remembrance of september eleven
flash back to september seventh
when tupac was murdered in vegas
he said that he predicted his own death
let us never forget it or should we ever live to regret it
like the day john f kennedy was assasinated in broad day
by a craze lunatic with a gun
who just happened to work on the same block in a library book depository
where the president would go for a little friday stroll
shots fired from the grassy knoll
but they don't know or do they?
whos they for them to say touchâ©
where all vunerable and it's spooky
this is about as cookey as i've ever felt now
count down to nuclear meltdown
seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
you can run you can do what you want to
but you know you aint gonna do nuttin
when its time its your time
you are the prime target
you have become public enemy number one

<i>[verse one]</i>
in my mind i'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
my soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
arsenic writer, author with arthritis
carpel tunnel, marshall will start shit-itis
hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed,
dick headed, a prick, a big headache i'm sick
quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are six critics
who wait for me to slip with it so quick
this dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
some lunatic lit it and it's not nelly
do not tell me to stop yelling, when i stop selling i quit
so stop dwelling and i am not failing
you fuckers are not ready, 'cause i got jelly like (beyonce's) pot belly
this is destiny, yes money i'm off running
so get off of me, i'm not slowing or softening

<i>[verse two]</i>
my head hits the pillow, a weeping willow, i can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
but these cellos help just to keep me mellow, hand's on my head, touched knees to elbow
i'm hunched over, emotion just flows over, these cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
i keep saying it, i can't stress it enough, so keep playing it and stand next to the subs
i choke mic's like asphyxiation when i'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'
fuck yeah i'm a basket case and i mastered this rap shit, 'til my ass gets wasted, 'til my assassination,
'til i'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation
forty-four mags a fascination, a taste for disaster and if that's the case then...

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three]</i>
this song isn't for you, it's for me, a true mc
it's what it do just to see if he still has it
and if his skills mastered,
he's able to spill raps long after his killed, that's a real mc
got you feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly
you still agree, as long as there's still this hunger and will in me
then expect a longer life expectancy
i'd be a savage beast if i ain't have this outlet to salvage me inside
i'd be exploding soaked in self loathing an mourning
so i'm warning you, don't coax me
it's silly, i'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing
who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be fooled
the press blows up this whole thing, it's stupid
they don't know 'cause they don't see that i'm wounded
all they did was ballooned it
i'm sick of talkin' 'bout these tattoos cartoon did
that's why i tuned it out, i'm sick of dukin'
and they can suck my dick while i'm pukin', and you too, you can

<i>[outro xtwo]</i>
expect no sympathy from me i'm an mc
this is how i'm supposed to be
cold as a g, my hearts frozen it don't even beat
so expect no apologies


oh oh oh oh oh ooh

there is no escaping
there's no place to hide
you scream, "someone save me!"
but they don't pay no mind
but they don't pay no mind
goodnight, goodbye!

you're walkin' down a horror corridor
it's almost four in the morning and you're in a
nightmare, it's horrible
right there's the coroner
waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
you're a goner he's onto ya
out the corner of his cornea he just saw you run
all you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore you're done
all he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
while everybody is watching in the party applauding it

here i sit while i'm caught up in deep thought again
contemplating my next plot again
swallowing a klonopin while i'm nodding in and out on the ottoman
at the ramada inn, holdin' on to the pill bottle then
lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and make sure i got all of it

wake up naked at mcdonald's with
blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
guess i must have just blacked out again
not again!

it's three a.m. in the mornin'
put my key in the door and
bodies layin' all over the floor and
i don't remember how they got there
but i guess i must've killed 'em (killed 'em)
i said
it's three a.m. in the mornin'
put my key in the door and
bodies layin' all over the floor and
i don't remember how they got there
but i guess i must've killed 'em (killed 'em)

sitting nude in my living room
it's almost noon
i wonder what's on the tube
maybe they'll show some boobs
surfin' every channel until i find hannah montana
then i reach for the aloe and lanolin
bust all over the wall paneling
dismantlin' every candle
on top of the fireplace mantel and
grab my flannel and my bandanna then
kiss the naked mannequin man again
you can see him standin' in my front window if you look in

i'm just a hooligan who's used to usin' hallucinogens
causin' illusions again
brain contusions again
cutting and bruisin' the skin
razors, scissors and pins
jesus, when does it end?
phases, that i go through
dazed and i'm so confused
days that i don't know who
gave these molecules to
me. what am i gon' do?
hey the prodigal son
the diabolical one
very methodical when i slaughter them

it's three a.m. in the mornin'
put my key in the door and
bodies layin' all over the floor and
i don't remember how they got there
but i guess i must've killed 'em (killed 'em)
i said
it's three a.m. in the mornin'

she puts the lotion in the bucket, it puts the lotion on the skin
or else it gets the hose again
she puts the lotion in the bucket, it puts the lotion on the skin
or else it gets the hose again

i cut and i slash slice and gash
last night was a blast
i can't quite remember when i had that
much fun off a half pint of the jack
my last vic and a half
a flashlight up kim kardashian's ass

i remember the first time i dismembered a family member
december i think it was, i was havin' drinks with my cousin
i wrapped him in christmas lights, pushed him into the stinkin' tub
cut him up into pieces and just when i went to drink his blood
i thought, "i oughta drink his bath water that oughta be fun."
that's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
the sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery son
your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
it's three a.m. and here i come so you should probably run
a secret passageway around here man there's got to be one
oh no there's probably none
he can scream all that he wants
top of his lungs, but ain't no stoppin' me from choppin' him up... up
'cause it's

three a.m. in the mornin'
put my key in the door and
bodies layin' all over the floor and
i don't remember how they got there
but i guess i must've killed 'em (killed 'em)

alright, i'mma lay the chorus first
here we go now

my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i am like i am 'cause i'm like her
because my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i'm on what i'm on 'cause i'm my mom

my mom, my mom
i know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
oh-ho, whoa-ho
but this is just a story of when i was just a shorty
and how i became hooked on va-aliu-um
valium was in everything, food that i ate
the water that i drank, fuckin' peas on my plate
she sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
so every day, i'd have at least three stomach aches
now, tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
son grow up to be an under-a-fuckin'-chiever?
my teacher didn't think i was gonna be nothin' either
"what the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fucking seat for?"
"mrs. mathers, your son has been huffing ether
either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer"
but all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
it was neither, i was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought
pee in a teacup? bitch, you ain't my keeper, i'm sleeping
what the fuck you keep on fucking with me for?
slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, i ain't playin'
go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra

my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i am like i am 'cause i'm like her
because my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i'm on what i'm on 'cause i'm my mom

wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
"you ate it yesterday, i ain't hear no complaints, did i?
now here's a plate full of painkillers
now just wait 'til i crush the valium and put it in your potatoes
you little motherfucker, i'll make you sit there and make
that retarded fucking face without even tasting it
you better lick the fucking plate, you ain't wasting it
put your face in it 'fore i throw you in the basement again
and i ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
in one fucking place, finnickin' 'til next thanksgiving
and if you still ain't finished it, i'll use the same shit again
then when i make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit
you little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
a rack fell and hit me in k-mart and they witnessed it
child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
and so what if he did? it's none of your dang business, kid"

my mom
there's no one else quite like my mom
i know i should let bygones be bygones
but she's the reason why i am high what i'm high on

'cause my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i am like i am 'cause i'm like her
because my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i'm on what i'm on 'cause i'm my mom

my mom loved valium, now all i am
is a party animal, i am what i am
but i'm strong to the finish with me valium spinach
but my buzz only lasts about two minutes
but i don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
i can't even write a rhyme without you in it
my valium, my vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh

man, i never thought that i could ever be
a drug addict, naw, fuck that, i can't have it happen to me
but that's actually
what has ended up happening, a tragedy
the fucking past ended up catching me
and it's probably where i got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
pharmaceuticals are the bomb, mom, beautiful
she killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
"here, want a snack? you hungry, you fuckin' brat?
look at that, it's a xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it"
but i don't need it "well fuck it then, break it up
take a little piece and beat it before you wake nathan up"
alright ma, you win, i don't feel like arguin'
i'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin'
stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip then i fall in bed
with a bottle of meds and a heath ledger bobblehead

my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i am like i am 'cause i'm like her
because my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i'm on what i'm on 'cause i'm my mom

my mom, i'm just like her
my mom, my mom, my mom
my mom, my mom, my mom
my mom, my mom, my mom
my mom, my momma

dr. dre, two thousand and ten

i was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
my stepfather said that i sucked in the bed 'til one night he snuck in and said
we're going out back, i want my dick sucked in the shed
can't we just play with teddy ruxpin instead?
after i fuck you in the butt, get some head, bust a nut, get some rest
the next day my mother said "i don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
the bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed he just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"
"debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck i bet you he's fakin' it,
i bet you i bet he probably just wants to see how upset you would get i'll go handle this of course, unless you object"
"ah go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head"

"did you get him?" naaw, fucker tried to bite my face off i just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw!
then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
then he played ping pong with his own ding dong!
that motherfucker's got nuts like king kong then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
and he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
everything, except his tank top and his training bra
ain't he raw? yeah maniac, that's shady dog
man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog?
shady dog, what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours
say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along

don't you know what felch means? (yeah), well then tell me would you rather get felched or do the felching?
fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
burp, belch, then go back for a second helping can you dig what i'm sayin' man, can you smell me?
i want you to feel me like my step father felt me (oohh)
fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping "shady what the fuck you saying!?"
i don't know help me! what the fuck's happening, i think i'm fucking melting
"marshall i just love you boy, i care about your well being" no dad, i said no,
i don't need no help peeing i'm a big boy, i can do it by myself see!
i only get naked when the baby sitter tells me she showed me a movie like "nightmare on elm street"
but it was x, and they called it "pubic hair on chelsea"
"well this is called ass rape, and we're shooting the jail scene"

ohh, it's music to my ears
oh man, how can i describe the way i feel?
fuckin' great, man
okay, let me see, how could i begin?

locked in mariah's wine cellar, all i had for lunch
was bread, wine, more bread, wine and cap'n crunch
red wine for breakfast and for brunch
and to soak it up and in between snack crackers to munch

mariah, whatever happened to us?
why did we have to break up? all i asked for was a glass of punch
you see i never really asked for much
i can't imagine what's goin' through you mind
after such a nasty break up

with that latin hunk luis miguel
nick cannon better back the fuck up
i'm not playin', i want her back you punk
this is hello kitty bedspread satin funk

mixed with egyptian, with a little rap and punk
zap and eric clapton shaft brings abba crunk
and yeah baby, i want another crack at ya
you can beat me with any spatula that you want

i mean i really want ya bad, you cunt
nick, you had your fun, i've come to kick you in your sack of junk
man, i could use a fresh batch of blood
so prepare your vernacular for dracula acupuncture

you can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
i'm the miracle whip, a trickster
my signature sound when the tube of lipsticks surround
i'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow, man

what an ensemble, what an assortment of pharmaceuticals
this beautiful pill dust in my palm
cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle
never knew i could remind me so much of my mama

i cut you like dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
the size of a sword, boy, i'm like the fuckin' red sonja
get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowin' ya norman
you're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy

you don't know what the fuck you're doin'
i ain't playin' no fuckin' more
nick cannon you prick, i wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
every minute there's a sucka born
snuck up on malakai and made the motherfuckers suck
on a shucka corn

shucka, shucka corn, shucka corn
hit jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fuckin' on
now what the fuck are ya doin'? you're runnin' over the snow blower
with the lawnmower blowing your bagpipes from baghdad

<i>[chorus]</i>

in the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
i bet you they become heterosexual
nothin' will stop me from molestin' you
titty fuckin' you 'till your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles

is what they said, to the two conjoined twins
"how's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?"
you need some ointment, just set up an appointment
who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip

i just got my one year sobriety coin chip
when the bad get goin', how bad does the goin' get?
baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbin' groins with
each other, especially when you're joined at the hip

i'm goin' to get the needle and thread from the sowin' kit
and attempt to separate 'em, and stitch them back at the loins, shit
knew the little boy with the chocolate chips, ahoy chip
cookie looky, even took me a polaroid

<i>[chorus]</i>


hello
allow me to introduce myself
my name is shady
it's so nice to meet you
it's been a long time
i'm sorry i've been away so long
my name is shady
i never meant to leave you

you see that chick in the gym checking me out?
any second i'm 'bout
to stick her neck in my mouth
i lose a pill and i'm recklessly wrecking the house
that was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?

there's the necklace i lost, right next to stephanie's blouse
man i should check to see if my mom left any out
nope, guess i'll re-route
maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
oh! jackpot! yeah, 'open sesame' mouth

down the hatch and the feeling you can't match it
i rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
a knapsack packed with like forty-some xanaxes

shorty come back, i'm tryna score me some lapdances
i'm bout to relapse so baby pour me some jack daniel's
formula forty-forty and fortys with bad capsules
the bad apple spoils the bunch i'm back at you

girl i don't mean any harm all i wanted to do is just say "hello"
and are you menstruating baby, my little friend's waiting to say "hello"
the way your titties are wiggling and your booty's shaking like jello
girl i don't mean any harm all i wanted to do is just say "hello"

my equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
i don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
it just becomes everyday extra-curriculum
no reason in particular, it was strictly fun

a fifth of rum and two bottles of one hundred and fifty-one
fifty-one people asleep in my damn living room
excuse me hun? but what is your name? vivian?
i woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?

of course we did, but didn't i strap jimmy hun?
i'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
no offense baby girl i don't mean any harm
but disease is something i'm trying to keep my penis free from

i find the package and i'm cool,
i immediately run
like speedy gonzalez to see if i see anyone
who might have a couple of threes,
i'm fiending for some
my head is pounding to the beat of the drum

girl i don't mean any harm all i wanted to do is just say "hello"
and do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
girl i don't mean any harm all i wanted to do is just say "hello"

oh, those were the days, they certainly were
it's hurting me to know that i'll be closing that curtain for good
word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word
i second that and i third,
rush to emergency surgery
to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased

he's no longer getting them free
hundred bucks for these percodans
plus it's getting to be where he lustfully search the den
pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him

tirelessly on the phone tryna rustle up muscle relaxers
for his back and a couple of paxils
now he's doubling backwards and he's stumbling back
slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack

now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
almost ended it that soon because of the fact
i'm just busting my own chops while i'm busting a rap
resuscitated and rejuved so fuck it, i'm back

girl i don't mean any harm all i wanted to do is just say "hello"
and do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow,
some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
girl i don't mean any harm all i wanted to do is just say "hello"

and so i'm saying,

hello allow me to introduce myself
my name is shady
so nice to meet you
it's been a long time
i'm sorry i've been away so long
my name is shady
i never meant to leave you

it's like starting over
clean slate


yo...
same song and dance
damn girl, everywhere i go
same song and dance
i like the way you move, all over the globe
same song and dance
something about it, man
same song and dance
in the pale moonlight yo...

i'm looking at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
the whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
the police constantly bugging you, non-stop
i walk up on ya, "well, hello tonya"
i think you got your onstar button inside your car stuck
you out of gas? do you got a flat?
i would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
i got your back
why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
and sit up front; i'm not asking, it's a trap
you just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
in broad day, and no mask for this attack
i heard 'em say exact opposites attract
if that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
c'mon

yeah baby, do that dance
it's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
that windshield's too strong for you
i said, yeah baby, sing that song
it's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
you sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
same song and dance

the first victim i had, she was a big one
big movie star, a party girl, big fun
she was the girl the media always picked on
in and out of rehab every four to six months
she was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
at nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
what an event it was, i was sitting in front
i was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
seen her backstage, now here's where i come in, son
look, here she comes, i better pull out the big guns
hello lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
how 'bout a ride to rehab? get in, cunt
but starting off on the wrong foot is what i didn't want
girl, i'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
see what i meant was, we should have a little intervention
come with me to brighton, let me relieve your tension
you little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
if i wanted to kill you, it would've already been done
slowly she gets in and i begin to lynch her
with sixty-six inches of extension cord

yeah baby, do that dance
it's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
that windshield's too strong for you
i said, yeah baby, sing that song
it's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
you sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
same song and dance

my second victim was even bigger than the first
pop star, icon, the whole works
she played a little schoolgirl when she first
burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
she twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
it irked me, it made me mad at first
i lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
was that i had developed a crush
i just didn't know how to tell it to her
should i cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
we'll settle this once and for all, i'ma tell her at dusk
tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her i must
creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
climb the gate, and ring the bell, like "hello, my love"
i just picked your prescription for seroquel up
now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
i'll share my valium with you 'cause i'm feeling you britney
i'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
i've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
c'mon toots, give me the valium alley-oop
i'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
and just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
i'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
new outfit? shit, i'll make a suit out of you, shoot
now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do

yeah baby, do that dance
it's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
that windshield's too strong for you
i said, yeah baby, sing that song
it's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
you sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
same song and dance

same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
same song and dance
same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
same song and dance
yeah
same song and dance
i know
same song and dance

no man would boldly go to this place
the devil only knows of this world
so dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold
oh so cold, oh

soon as my flow starts i compose art like the ghost of mozart
even though they all say that they're real, i know that most aren't
boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
girl, you think you're so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

a world so dark, a world so cold
a world where only some will go
but none return, when will they learn?
where do they go? god only knows
stay wide awake

fe-fi-fo-fum, i think i smell the scent of a placenta
i enter central park, it's dark, it's winter in december
i see my target, put my car in park and approach a tender
young girl by the name of brenda and i pretend to befriend her
sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl, you might've
heard of me before, see whore
you're the kind of girl that i'd assault and rape
then figure why not try to make your pussy wider
fuck you with an umbrella
then open it up while the shit's inside ya
i'm the kind of guy that's mild
but i might flip and get a little bit wilder
impregnate a lesbian, yeah
now let's see her have triplets, and i'll disintegrate them babies
as soon as they're out her with formaldehyde and cyanide
girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
no need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun out of
murderin', i'd rather go vinn-vinn, and now you see just how the
fuck i do just what i do when i cut right through your scalp, uhh
shit, wait a minute, i mean skull
my knife seems dull, pull another one out, uh

soon as my flow starts, i compose art like the ghost of mozart

boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
girl, you think you're so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

a world so dark, a world so cold
a world where only some will go
but none return, when will they learn?
where do they go? god only knows
stay wide awake

so dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
there's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
but they can't see what i can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
it's making me play hide-and-seek like jason, i'm so hungry
she's naked, see, no privacy but i can see she wants me
so patient, see, i try to be but gee, why does she taunt me?
pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
and i creep right through the front, see
so blatantly, but silently 'cause i know that she's sound 'sleep
"who's waking me so violently, and why's he on top of me?"
"he's raping me," she tries to scream
"somebody please get him off me
he's taping me, he's biting me, he's laughing like it's funny"
she's scraping me, she's fighting me
she's scratching like some dumb freak
escaping me, no dice, you see, i might just be ted bundy
or satan, gee, what a sight to see, i'm dancing in my red panties
i'm crazy, but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
stay away from me 'cause i'm dancing
to quite a different drum beat

soon as my flow starts i compose art like the ghost of mozart
even though they all say that they're real, i know that most aren't
boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
girl, you think you're so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

a world so dark, a world so cold
a world where only some will go
but none return, when will they learn?
where do they go? god only knows
stay wide awake

better try to stay wide awake
or you might end up found dead by the lake
soon as you lay me down to sleep
bitch, your soul i'mma try to take
pray for light of day right away
why do they try to fight today?
i must make them pay twice as much
might as well put the knife away
now i use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
how did you figure out i was down in your basement? now ya
must've just heard the sound of my stomach
growling from down there
prowler, there's no one fouler
bound ya, that's how they found ya
face down in the tub, i drown ya
with piles of downers around ya
such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
jump out on you now like i was a jawa from fuckin' star wars
jabba the hutt, beddy-bye-bye
beddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
not ya everyday damien, bathe me in holy water
nothing like son of sam, so please understand
there's no gun in hand
where's the thrill in the hunt?
there's no fun in that, here i come with axe
fun to act like lumberjack when i'm hacking 'em up with that
what was that? dial nine-one-one, someone's coming in from the back

soon as my flow starts, i compose art like the ghost of mozart
even though they all say that they're real, i know that most aren't
boy, you think you're clever, don't ya?
girl, you think you're so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

a world so dark, a world so cold
a world where only some will go
but none return, when will they learn?
where do they go? god only knows
stay wide awake


good evening! this is your fucking captain speaking
we will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet 
that's eight million miles in the sky

i'm dre from back in the day from nwa from black and the gray from 
choking a bitch to smacking her face from
stacking up bodies to 
racking their kegs up from racking a bitch to
stacking them crates up 
i'm still hungry 
and i'm back with a tapeworm 
and we was happening and rapping and tame at me 
shady for us competition  faggot, there ain't none

a nice environment 
surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound i surround the hydrants 
taking lives of firemen say goodbye, here i am again naked wives and vicadin 
before i begin to get so high; pussy boy, i could spin fin, fin 
fuck the handle i fly off the hinge let that boy off the bench, coach and throw it to him 
there he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again 
baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin 
i show you every inch grows of my foreskin 
show me nipple i pinch, throw up, and throw up a ten 
now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again 
the sorcerer of intercourse - if it's forced, it's him 
don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within 
and when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain 

so one more time for old time's sake
 dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake 
now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go you are now smoking with the best (the best)

you are now smoking with the best (the best)


yea, (oh, oh), yea yea, oh
i feel like dancing, i feel like dancing
i smell something in the air that's making me high
i said i smell something in the air that's making me high

(ok here we go) do-re-me-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti-da-so
lyrical rascal, kick back the tabasco
you motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
picasso with a pick axe, a sick asshole
tic-tac-toe comes with six-pack with exacto
knives, strangling wives with thick lasso
big bags of the grass, zig-zags, i'm with the doc, so
you know how that go, skull and the crossbones
this is poison to boys and girls who do not know
you do not want to try this at home, my lil' vato
this is neither the time nor the place to get macho
so crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
it's not what you expected, not what you thought, so
'bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

it must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the henny that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind
it must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the henny that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind

your dreams are getting fulfilled, ooh i'm literally getting a chill
spitting at will, me and dre have just finished splitting a pill
you're submitting to skill, sitting still
i'm admitting i'm beginning to feel like i don't think anyone's real
faced with a dilemma: i can be dalai lama
and be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of jeffrey dahmer
please don't upset me, mama, you're looking sexy, mama
don't know if it's the lala or the rum and pepsi, mama
don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
be used as extra topping the next time i make a pizza
how many people you know
who can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row?
put 'em in chronological order, beginning with jack the ripper
name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper
location of the woods
where the body was dragged and then dumped
the trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
and which model, which lake they found her in
how they attacked the victim
say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
which knife and which gun, hat kid, what wife, and which nun
don't stop, i like this, it's fun, the fucking night's just begun

it must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the henny that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind
i said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the henny that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind

when i'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
you're stuck with the same stick that your tryin' to light
behind the boards sits dre, legends are made this way
isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
maybe you need some lyric serum syrup for your symptoms
here's a dosage of the antidote now you give him some
he can give her some, she can give them some, get behind a linn drum
make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
the spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
starting from scratch and then ending up at the endin' of
capable of winning a pulitzer so unbelievable it's a
titanium cranium that's full of sur-
prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
you stare into your stereos high
good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
i ain't even smoke anything i ain't even drinking

it must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the henny that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind
it must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the henny that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind


<i>[spoken introduction:]</i>
d.m.c. we have a mid thirtys male
found down unresponsive
possible over dose
substance unknown
pulse is sixty and thready
respiration's eight he's intubated
and we're bagging him now
uuh b.p. ninety over palp
patient cool pale and diaphoretic
has aspirated
uuh g.s.c. is three
we'll update en route
e.t.a. ten minutes

as i fall deeper into a manic state
i'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
i seem to gravitate to the bottle of nyquil then i salivate
start off with the nyquil like i think i'll just have a taste
couple of sips of that then i gradually graduate
to a harder prescription drug called valium like ya that's great
i go to take just one and i end up like having eight
now i need something in my stomach cause i haven't ate
maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak
and you'd think with all i have at stake
look at my daughter's face... "mommy, something is wrong with dad, i think.
he's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me.
won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me.
and all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos.
and he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat."

sometimes i feel so alone,
i just don't know,
feels like i been down this road before.
so lonely and cold.
it's like something takes over me,
soon as i go home and close the door.
kinda feels like dã©jã  vu.
i wanna get away from this place i do.
but i can't and i won't say i tried but i know that's a lie cause i don't
and why? i just don't know...

maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
that's the devil in my ear i been sober a fucking year
and that fucker still talks to me he is all i can fucking hear
marshall, come on, we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers.
and maybe if i just drink half i'll be half buzzed for half of the time
who's that mastermind behind that little line?
with that kind of rational man i got half a mind
to have another half of glass of wine sound asinine
ya i know
but i never had no problem with alcohol
ouch, look out for the wall aim for the couch i'm about to fall
i missed the couch and down i go looking like a bouncy ball
shit must have knocked me out 'cause i ain't feel the ground at all
wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am i?
man fuck am i hungover and god damn i got a head ache
shit half a vicodin, why can't i?
"all systems ready for take off, please, stand by"

sometimes i feel so alone,
i just don't know,
feels like i been down this road before,
so lonely and cold,
it's like something takes over me,
soon as i go home and close the door,
kinda feels like dã©jã  vu.
i wanna get away from this place i do.
but i can't and i won't say i tried but i know that's a lie cause i don't
and why? i just don't know...

so i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ah
a couple weeks go by it ain't even like i'm getting high
now i need it just not to feel sick ya i'm getting by
wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die
oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
there's new rules it's cool if it's helping you to get through
it's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
what else is new? fuck it, what would elvis do in your shoes?
now here i am three months later full blown relapse
just get high until the kids get home from school homes relax
and since i'm convinced that i'm insomniac i need these pills to be able to sleep so i take three naps
just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
that's an ambien each nap how many valium? three.
and that will average out to about one good hours sleep
ok, so now you see the reason how come he
has taken four years just to put out an album beat
see me and you we almost had the same outcome heath
cause that christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing
it was bologna was it the methadone ya think
or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
your vcr tape cases with you ambient cr great places to hide ain't it
so you can lie to hallie
i'm going beddy bye whitney baby good night alaina
go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
they said they found me on the bathroom floor... damn

sometimes i feel so alone,
i just don't know,
feels like i been down this road before,
so lonely and cold,
it's like something takes over me,
soon as i go home and close the door.
kinda feels like dã©jã  vu.
i wanna get away from this place i do.
but i can't and i won't say i tried but i know that's a lie cause i don't.
and why? i just don't know...


<i>[sample - rock therapy "reaching out":]</i>
lately i've been hard to reach, i've been too long on my own
everybody has a private world where they can be alone
are you calling me? are you trying to get through?
are you reaching out for me, like i'm reaching out for you?

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i'm just so fuckin' depressed, i just can't seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump
but i need something to pull me out this dump,
i took my bruises, took my lumps
fell down and i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up
in order for me to pick the mic back up
i don't know how or why or when i ended up in this position i'm in
i'm starting to feel distant again
so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent
but i just can't admit
or come to grips with the fact that i may be done with rap
i need a new outlet, and i know some shit's so hard to swallow
but i just can't sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow
but i know one fact i'll be one tough act to follow
one tough act to follow
i'll be one tough act to follow
here today, gone tomorrow
but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

in my shoes, just to see
what it's like, to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes
but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get fucked.
just stay true to you
so don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
oh, they can all get fucked.
just stay true to you, yeah, so...

i think i'm starting to lose my sense of humor
everything is so tense and gloom
i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature in the room
just as soon as i walk in
it's like all eyes on me
so i try to avoid any eye contact
'cause if i do that then it opens the door for conversation
like i want that... i'm not looking for extra attention
i just want to be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i don't need no fucking man servant
trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack
and half of them ain't even funny like
"ha!, marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn"
unfortunately i am, but i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why don't you all sit down?
listen to the tale i'm about to tell
hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

in my shoes, just to see
what it's like, to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes
but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
oh they can all get fucked.
just stay true to you so
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
oh they can all get fucked.
just stay true to you so

nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands we're dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves
and flip them, don't expect no help
now i could have either just
sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which i'm placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid
to wait by the door and pack his bags
who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in
in every single place
every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it meant acting stupid

aunt edna always told me "keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that"
meanwhile i'm just standin' there
holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
'til i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
i learned my lesson then cause i wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
'cause where you see it from where you're sitting
it's probably one hundred and ten% different
i guess we would have to walk a mile
in each other's shoes, at least
what size you wear? i wear tens
let's see if you can fit your feet

in my shoes, just to see
what it's like, to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes
but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get fucked.
just stay true to you
so don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
oh, they can all get fucked.
just stay true to you, yeah, so...

<i>[sample - rock therapy "reaching out":]</i>
lately i've been hard to reach, i've been too long on my own
everybody has a private world where they can be alone...
so are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?
are you reaching out for me, like i'm reaching out for you?
so oh oh

<i>[eminem:]</i>
yeah... to my babies. stay strong.
daddy will be home soon
and to the rest of the world, god gave you them shoes
to fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
even if it sounds corny,
don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful
so...

replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
hit jason vorhees with forty's
stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
gave hannibal lecter a fucking nectarine sat him in a fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
walked up elm street with a fucking wiffle bat drew fought freddy krueger and edward scissor hands too
came out with a little scratch, ooh
looking like i got in a fucking pillow fight with a triple fat goose
insanity, can it be vanity, where is the humanity
and having a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
with a strap that wraps twice around my back then they latch it
cut your fucking head off and ask you where you're headed off to,
get it? headed off to (haha)
medic this headache's awful
this anesthetic is pathetic so is this diabetic waffle
and this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco

<i>[twox]</i>
here comes the rain and thunder now
nowhere to run, to run to now
i've disappeared, you'll wonder how
looking for me, i'm underground

so, it wasn't a choice, it was i had to do this.
and now i'm ninety days clean and uh, that's all i have to share.
thanks.

thanks for sharing brian, is there anyone else who would like to share this evening?

yeah i got something i want to share.
when you walked through the door you were queer to me
so come here baby boy, just come here to me
you're a cock boy, everybody wants you
you're gayer than you would ever claim to
i won't have to rape you
so homie lay down down down, lay down down down, lay down down down, lay down lay down.

where's everybody going? this always went over real big in gay a
ok wait, i got another one

i just love condoms and lots of cum, no? oh, shit.


look, if i were to rap
about the crap
that's out
that's the route
you'd probably want me to take
'cause you're just dyin' to know what i think
and my take on some other rappers

if i was to say something about paul wall,
you'd probably crap in your pants,
'cause i'm white, and he's white,
so he's like my competition
i mean, right?

nope, paul wall is dope
and so's bubba, so
but i don't compete with nobody
i just go hard, do the rope-a-dope ali shuffle,
and dance around my opponents, do donuts
sometimes i play possum
like i'm asleep it's awesome
i'm like a sleeping giant,
and when i awake i'm like dre
i just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
and sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em full of poison
and make a noise like a snake before i kill 'em
and let 'em know that i just don't feel 'em
and smack 'em with the backward e, the eminem emblem

i was taught if you're gonna murder somebody you should face em
tell em why,
look them dead in the eye,
then waste 'em
and the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
and swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell
in the shadows of all who are willing to sell
their souls for this rap game and it goes
one, two, three (check, check) one, two, three (check, check) one, two, three,
that ain't the hook, now follow me

there's nothing else for me to say,
my public adores me
everybody bores me,
they're just so corny
so at night before i sleep i look in the mirror
the mirror grows lips and it whispers, "come nearer."

my darling,
i don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
you and me were meant to be together my darling,
and if i cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
'cause i possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

i don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
you and me were meant to be together my darling,

"shady, i know you're in there somewhere. come here.

"but i'm here to rebuild you."

"but shady, we were meant for each other.

yeah so what of her?
"well think about what she did to you and your little brother.
all them foster homes.",
fuck you motherfucker! i had you beat
"no i was playin' possum.
remember? i let you watch your little girls blossom.
i gave you enough time.
your soul's mine.
i'm taking it back."
you fucking bitch why!?
"because i love you. look a little closer.
isn't that us on that poster?"

my darling,
i don't ever want you to leave me my darling,

i don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
you and me were meant to be together my darling,
and if i cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
'cause i possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

"shady, listen..."
(shady!)
"you hear that?
they're screaming for you, i can bring your career back"
but i don't want it back!
"yes you do."
no i don't!
"yes you do, you're gonna regret it later!"
no i won't!
"i'mma get dre on the phone, i'll just call the doctor"
go ahead, i already talked to dre yesterday
"well i got him on the phone right now!"
(slim!)
you're lying,
"yo slim",
how, why now! what up dre?
"check this out slim, i gotta talk to ya.
i don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
drugs, you became a lot softer"
but dre, all shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
"well, just think about it slim, i don't care.
just hit me back, and let me know what's up"
fuck this mirror!
"i'm not in the mirror, i'm inside you.
let me guide you"
fuck you, die you son of a bitch
"put the gun down",
bye bye!
ok i'm still alive,
"so am i too!
you can't kill a spirit, even if you tried to
you sold your soul to me. need i remind you?
you remember that night you prayed to god
you'd give anything to get a record deal.
well dre signed you
this is what you wanted your whole life marshall, right ooh?
look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, wooo!
oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too
that you're just now seeing the downside to
lose your best friend from highschool, your wife too
ain't even sure if your kids like you
come off tour, can't even sleep at night without nyquil
become a valium addict, start a rehab cycle
but together we can break the cycle.
marshall."
what!
"no one's gonna love you like i do!"

my darling,
i don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
you and me were meant to be together my darling,
and if i cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
'cause i possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

i don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
you and me were meant to be together my darling,
and if i cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
'cause i possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

i said, i don't ever want you to leave me my darling,
you and me were meant to be together my darling,
and if i cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling,
'cause i possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body


<i>[verse one]</i>
so this is it...
this is what i wished for
just isn't how i envisioned it
famed to the point of imprisonment
i just thought the shit'd be different
but something changed
the minute that i got a whiff of it
i started to inhale it
smell it
started sniffin' it
and it became my cocaine
i just couldn't quit
i just wanted a little bit
then it turned me (in) to a monster
i became a hypocrite
concert after concert

i was raking in the dough
rolling in green
had the game hemmed up
like a sewing machine
but i was losing my freedom
there was no where for me
to not go and be seen
and just go and be me
and there was no in-between
you either loved it or hate it

every cd critics gave it a three, then three
years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
and call the slim shady lp the greatest
the marshall mathers was a classic
the eminem show was fantastic
but encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
i guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
a couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
and eight years later, i'm still at it
divorce, re-married
a felon
a father
sleeping pill addict
and this is real talk
i feel like the incredible hulk
my back has been broke, and i can still walk

<i>[chorus]</i>
so be careful what you wish for
'cause you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know
what to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
come back on you ten-fold

i said

be careful what you wish for
'cause you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know
what to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
come back on you ten-fold

<i>[verse two]</i>
i got a letter from a fan, that said
he's been praying for me
every day and for some reason
it's been weighing on my mind heavy
'cause i don't read every
letter i get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
you didn't pray for me when i was local
and as i lay these vocals
i think of all the shit i had to go through
just to get to where i'm at
i've already told you at least

a thousand times in these rhymes
i appreciate the prayer, but i've already got
god on my side
and it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint
man, boy's got to look
nuts
and that's the only word i can think of right now
on how
to describe the shit
this is like a vibe you get
go ahead and bob to it
just watch what you wish for, 'cause i got the shit

<i>[chorus]</i>
so be careful what you wish for
'cause you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know
what to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
come back on you ten-fold

i said

be careful what you wish for
'cause you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know
what to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
come back on you ten-fold

and i will never stop like i'm running from the cops
hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
but what should i scream for this is my theme park
my mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
let the king talk check the price and pay attention
lil wayne that's what they got to say or mention

there they go, packing stadiums as shady spits his flow
nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa
he can make them look like bozos
he's wondering if he should spit this slow
fuck no! go for broke
his cup just runneth over, oh no
he ain't have a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
they've been waiting patiently for pinocchio to poke his nose
back into the game and they know
rap will never be the same as before
bashing in the brains of these hoes
and establishing a name as he goes
the passion and the flame is ignited
you can't put it out once we light it
this shit is exactly what the fuck that i'm talking about when we riot
you dealing with a few true villains
who stand inside of the booth truth spilling
and spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
now rewind it!
payback motherfucker for the way that you got at me how's it taste?
when i slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
i'm hannibal lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
you ain't gonna have no face to save by the time i'm through with this place
so drake

<i>[eminem - verse one:]</i>
i want you to understand something
that when i come up in this bitch, i want the fans jumping
i want them fists pumping in the air, i don't look like a millionaire
but i feel like a million bucks, ladies won't you fill your cups?
shady's come to fill you up, if you a d or a c-cup
you can even be a b, it's just me and d-r-e
you'll be in the e-r, we are strapped with so much t-n-t
we may blow, no, not even c-p-r from the emt
can help you to resuscitate, you bustas must be flustered, wait
you can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(chk chk) what's my name? shady came to crush the game
instantly, not even fair to them cause they pale in comparisons
so much they might as well wear a skin, don't you wish you could just share his pen?
cause this shit is getting embarrassing, the fog is thick and the air is thin
cause he won't even let them try to breathe, dadidadidadadi
he makes it look so easy, girl you just hit the lottery

<i>[eminem - chorus:]</i>
now this would be the part of the song
where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
try to restrain us, you can't contain us
we still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
everywhere we go, it seems we looking
for any excuse to just cut loose

so this would be the part of the song
where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose

<i>[dr. dre (eminem) - verse two:]</i>
this is when shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand
this is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with mathers
then chaos erupts, em's in back, dre's in the front
so do what we say and once it's over like a suance, it hums
(it makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance)
it's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
take a day off or what? man, you better lay off the blunts
you must be smokin' something, think i ain't smokin' nothing, stay off my nuts

now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of grey goose
yeah, girl, shake that caboose, i don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
d-r-e is on the loose, i'm like a goose when it comes to the chronic use
you know i can't stand to lose, me and my goons are like animals
wake up like a pack of wolves and we came here to extract the roof
yeah, man, ain't that the truth? girl, your mans is like in the booth
definitely back up in this bitch, you swing? all hell breaks loose

<i>[chorus]</i>
now this would be the part of the song

<i>[eminem]</i>
now i know you're feelin discouraged but homie just mark my words
i'm mur-durin the flow, liquid courage i'm fin' to blow
as soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe
i'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
we're in the indigo winnebago with tinted windows
ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit yo' hoe
with speakers knockin it's three o'clock, me and doc then proceed to drop
"e" and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
we ain't bluffin for nothin, we'll knock the stuffin out you
revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
yeah, move it or lose it freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably
pass up on that little cute chick right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me
born and raised in the c-p-t, yeah los angeles, rules of the streets
them haters hatin on me, but i refuse to lose any sleep
keep that deuce-deuce in the seat, dre fall off that's news to me

"mister, help me" 's what he said to me and then sunk
women skinning and then cutting them up in chunks
in comes the woman with cocoa butter skin once

<i>[eminem]</i>
always, you can see him lurkin in the hallways
carcasses of caucasian females in his crawl space
how the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place
hide 'em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?
well fuck it then, i got nothing but time, i'll wait
until it dries for the moment i guess you're all safe
after i sand it and buff it i guess that i'll paint
my chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't

you can even hear the evil spirits comin from within
someone's in, the back of my damn house rummagin

evelyn, why you tryin to fight? you will never win

all aboard, okay, next stop, my basementâ¦ ha ha
i'll meet you down there

there once was a saying that i used to say
back in the day when i met dre
i used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
that if i went gold, i'd go right through the roof
he said "what if you went platinum?" i'd just laugh at him
that's not happening, that i can't fathom
eighty-something million records worldwide later,
i'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady
you slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touchã© me
rappers try to play me, they use hailie as a ukulele
woopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
that's a no-no even she knows dada's fucking crazy
fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas, fucking a b
maybe it's because i never had a mother raise me
fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
you may think it's 'cause of the way that i was brought up
but it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
every line i ever said has got me in a corner
you might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
you wouldn't listen man, i tried to warn ya when you started
now your brain's all haunted 'cause of all the shit you thought of
chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
i never thought it'd come to this, i ought to just be honest but

there once was a saying that i used to say

sorry lance, mr. lambert, and aiken ain't gonna make it
they get so mad, when i call them both faggots
all these fucking voices in my head i can't take it
someone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore i shake it
you're standing adjacent to jason, slash, leatherface, and
together makes 'em a fucking bad combination
i lashed at the doctor in my last operation
shoved the wiener schnitzel up his ass, hopped away
somebody please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
homie, i'm the scheiãe, ask doctor dreizehn
i can't leave the game, i just can't walk away son
no, not a-now, not a chance, not today son
i can't believe i leave for one brief second
and you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
and use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, feck it
i'll just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

there once was a saying that i used to say
back in the day when i met dre
i used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
that if i went gold, i'd go right through the roof
he said "what if you went platinum?" i'd just laugh at him

eighty-something million records worldwide later
i'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

elevator in my house, i'll smell ya later
i blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-i
thinking 'bout an escalator now, steps, i hate 'em
told the neighbor step away, then i just pepper sprayed 'em
yeah, for every time you ride down the street
or hideout, drive by my house and beep
like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
lie down fucker (baa), try countin' sheep
and you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
mace in your face bitch, cry now pussy
this is my house, all nine thousand feet
so you can suck my dick with amy winehouse's teeth
then i shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
while i let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!

there once was a saying that i used to say

<i>[verse one]</i>

and crush it with my butt muscles while i cut vocals,

while i stomp mudholes in ya ass girl,
now lets cuddle,
blood curdling your gurgling on your blood,
what i do for my next trick,
im feeling won-der-ful,
i think i might just do something a little less subtle,
shove a fucking tonka truck up a little kids butthole,
feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the valentines day massacre slash assassin
i slash her in the ass with a icicle
and leave her laying a blood bath
while i put a catheter in
and jump in the bath with her,
in my spiderman mask man
just imagine the fun i can have with a strap on,
stick it up kim kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon,
are those pistachio's damn, i'd like to have some,
laying on the patio man, rolling a fat one,
shady drop the magic marker, put the cap on,
god damn man are you that much of an asshole,

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse two]</i>
i'm like houdini,
tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
one of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie,
make the shit disappear like tara reid in a bikini, believe me homie,
you don't know the meaning of a meanie,
they call me the fruit loop from jupiter,
i'm trying to maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot,
dont move or ya might get it stuck so fucking far up in your uvula
you aint gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus,
totally tubular sniffing glue through a tube in the studio
now who do ya think is more fruitier,
weenier smoothered in peanut butter putting on a tube of ya eye shadow and man it look nice,
you should've seen it mother,
i think i'll put a piece of art on my visa card,
then i'll go meet mischa barton with a cuisinart
then mosy on over to rosie-o-donnell's
with mcdonald's jump on her lap and watch the sopranos..

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three]</i>
shady what are you doing chewing on a human,
grab an aluminum bat hit heidi klum in the back, boom!
assuming the fact that dudes in the back room
using the bathroom vacuum and a racoon,
skewing a rat a cat screwing a baboon,
you shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom,
you should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds,
you in a trance, i'm back doing my dance ooh,
but there afraid i might get sarah palin by the hair
and make her wear a bathing suit and take her para sailing
shady why you gotta pick on the lady for,
why you make her read eighty-four bed time stories to you in baby talk?
cause i'm scared there's monster's under my bed,
kelly pickler hid my juice box under my bassinet,
no wonder my ass is wet my diaper needs to be changed,
you like graffiti dike, well i can pee pee and write your name,

<i>[chorus]</i>

fine nobody wants to play with me 
fuck you then bitch!
you guys are always mean to me anyways 
all you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
you guys are gonna make me...make me sad i'm sad
i'm gonna cry...i'm crying
i'm going' tell my mom....mom...


yeah, girl.
can you hear that?
it's playing our song.
are you sleepy?
take a nap.
you're not afraid of the dark, are you?

you hear the beat as it makes you not wanna go to sleep.
i knock on dakota's door. it's locked so i go to creep
'round the back with binoculars: not 'cause i wanna peep
but because i'm hungry. she smells like tacos i wanna eat.

visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet.
with sugar plums.
oh, look, here comes marshall! he's on your street!
he's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet.
now walk on 'em.
he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek.

like a thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham,
cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam.
flavor my favorite graham crackers with jonbenã©t rams'.
i guess a modern-day jack the ripper is all that i am.

my music box.
'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep.
but i can hear you, my love. you keep calling me.
although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me.
so when you call, i come, i will answer.

'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep.
i hear my music box playing a song for me.
so, won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
and would you be my private little dancer?

i almost look comatose.
who wants to be sober gross?
i foam like a doberman. mouth open.
i overdose.
put coke up my nostrils in both my holes and i plug my nose.
my pupils quadruple in size. eyes are so bugged. i know.

i put on my mother's make-up, get naked and run around
wavin' the gun around.
i think i'm down to a hundred pounds.
there's thunder.
i wonder how come it rains but the sun is out.
the devil's upset with his wife.
they must be sluggin' it out.

i must be buggin' the fuck out,
but what the fuck about?
voices are leading me up to the attic. i love my house.
they pull and they tug my blouse.
the sound of a music box comes from inside a toy chest.
but what do i do? it's locked.

i pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts.
i dig 'til i find it, i wind it up and the tune just starts.
it's playing a song so beautiful, and the room is dark.
the moon is full. i smell a funeral. guess i'll loom in the park.

my music box.
'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep.
but i can hear you, my love. you keep calling me.
although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me.
so when you call, i come, i will answer.

'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep.
i hear my music box playing a song for me.
so won't you twirl around, and do a whirl for me?
and would you be my private little dancer?

i'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's neck like a pixy stix.
the sick satan-worshippin'
bitches get horse-whippings.
i'm in the back.
through the back door slipping through the crack
leavin' the corpse drippin'.

the mortician of love sent from above.
forced entry. the more wenchy the more stingy i become.
been doin' this for more than a quarter century i'm just numb.
am i dreamin'? is it real? someone pinch me on the buns.

the time has come to tie her up.
gotta roll me the ladder.
i've had enough of the chatter.
climb up to the window, look at her.
then climb in slow to shatter
her brain matter
and batter
her with the bat.
a matter of fact that will splatter her.
but before i do that, i'll have a chat to flatter her.

give her two compliments, back-to-back, like "tabitha,
i'm your secret admirer. i'm back to ravish you.
so strong is your fight, but you're no match for dracula."

prolonging her plight, as i go back to stabbin' her.
dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her.
zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera.
stand back 'cause here comes your man jack. so, pamela...

my music box.
'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep.
but i can hear you, my love, you keep calling me.
although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me.
so, when you call, i come, i will answer.

'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep.
i hear my music box playing a song for me.
so, won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
and would you be my private little dancer?

<i>[chorus]</i>


'cause some things just don't change
it's better when they stay the same
although the whole world knows your name
so on a bigger stage
they came to see you spit your game

but it shouldn't be difficult to explain
just why you came back again, you hate the fame
love the game, cold as ice you remain
fuck 'em all, tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again

now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
oh bitches don't like that, homie i'll be nicer to women
when aquaman drowns and the human torch starts swimming

it's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
i'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
but i swear, you try to diss me, i'll slaughter you
i put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
the last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
and say i was writing this and i thought of you so

i don't know, i don't know but i'll probably be this way 'til my dying day
i don't know why i'm so, i'm so cold mean things i don't mean to say
i guess this is how you made me


before i start this song, man
i just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
and bearing with me over these last couple of years
while i figure this shit out

<i>[kobe:]</i>
is anybody out there?
it feels like i'm talking to myself
no one seems to know my struggle
and everything i come from
can anybody hear me, yeah?
i guess i keep talking to myself
it feels like i'm going insane
am i the one who's crazy, yeah?

<i>[eminem:]</i>
so why in the world do i feel so alone
nobody but me, i'm on my own
is there anyone out there
who feels the way i feel
if there is,
let me hear just so i know that i'm not the only one

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i went away, i guess, and opened up some lanes
but there was no one who even knew i was going through growin' pains
hatred was flowing through my veins
on the verge of going insane
i almost made a song dissing lil wayne
it's like i was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
i felt horrible about myself
he was spitting and i wasn't
anyone who was buzzing back then coulda got it
almost went at kanye too
god it feels like i'm goin' psychotic
thank god that i didn't do it
i'da had my ass handed to me
and i knew it but proof isn't here to see me through it
i'm in the booth popping another pill tryna talk myself into it
are you stupid? you're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
you're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying, you're denying
your health is declining with your self-esteem, you're crying out for help

<i>[kobe:]</i>
is anybody out there?

marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
all i know is i'm wallowin', self-loathing and hollow
bottoms up on the pill bottle
maybe i'll hit my bottom tomorrow
my sorrow echoes in this hall though
but i must be talking to the wall though
i don't see nobody else (i guess i keep talking to myself)
but all these other rappers suck is all that i know
i've turned into a hater, i've put up a false bravado
but marshall is not an egomaniac that's not his motto
he's not a desperado he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
inside him, one foot on the brake one on the throttle
falling asleep with writer's block in the parking lot of mcdonald's
but instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it
admit you got a problem you brain is clouded you pouted long enough
it isn't them it's you you fuckin' baby
quit worrying about what they do and do shady
i'm fucking going crazy

<i>[kobe:]</i>

encore i was on drugs, relapse i was flushing em out
i've come to make it up to you now, no more fucking around
i've got something to prove to fans 'cause i feel like i've let em down
so please accept my apology i finally feel like i'm back to normal
i feel like me again, let me formally reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
the new me's back to the old me and homie i don't show no
signs of slowing up, pulling up, blowing up, all over
my life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos

yeah. you know?.. critics, man
critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
you know the one thing i notice about critics, man?
is critics never ask me how my day went
well i'mma tell 'em

yesterday my dog died, i hog-tied a ho, tied her in a bow
said, "next time you blog, try to spit a flow."
you wanna criticize, dog? try a little mo'
i'm so tired of this i could blow, fire in the hole
i'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
better hold on a little tighter here i go
flows tighter, hot headed as ghost rider
cold-hearted as spiderman throwing a spider in the snow
so you better get lower than flo-rida inside of a lowrider with no tires in the hole
why am i like this? why is winter cold?
why is it when i talk i'm so biased to the hoes?
listen, dog, christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
this isn't golf this is a blisterin' assault
those are your wounds this is the salt
so get lost
shit dissing me is just like pissing off the wizard of oz
wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
grab the scissors and saws and
cut out your livers gizzards and balls
throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
so sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
got the gall to make chris piss in his drawers
tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

you're on fire
that's how you know you're on a roll
'cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
you're on fire
man, i'm so fuckin' sick i got ambulances pulling me over and shit
you're on fire
you need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
you're on fire, you're on fire

i just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses if you mistook this for a song, look
this ain't a song it's a warning to brooke, hogan and david cook
that the crook just took over so book
run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
i'm lightning in a skillet you're a fuckin' flash in a pan
i pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
mr mathers is the man
yeah i'm pissed but i would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
come back and whip your ass with it again
saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand it'll eat through anything metal the ass of iron man
turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
yeah ask denaun, man
hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
fuck it i ain't playing
pull up in a van and hop out on a homeless man holding a sign saying,
"vietnam vet," i'm out my fuckin' mind, man
kick over the can beat his ass and leave him nine grand
so if i seem a little mean to you this ain't savage you ain't never seen a brute
you wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
you couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
saying you sick quit playing you prick don't nobody care
then why the fuck am i yelling at air
i ain't even talking to no one 'cause ain't nobody there
nobody will fuckin' test me 'cause these hos won't even dare
i'm wasting punchlines but i got so many to spare i just thought of another one that might go here
naw don't waste it save it psycho yeah
plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about michael's hair

you're on fire
that's how you know you're on a roll

don't want no cum stain
bitch, you listening? tryna turn me down
slut, i'm talking to you, turn me back up
are you insane tryna talk over me in the car
shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'
i'mma shit stain on the underwear of life
what's the saying? where there's thunder there's lightning
and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
then how the fuck have i been hit six times
in three different locations
on four separate occasions?
and you can bet your stinking ass
that i've come to smash everything in my path
fork was in the road took the psycho path
poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
so hit the dance floor cutie while i do my duty on this microphone
shake your booty shorty i'm the shit
why you think proof used to call me doody?

<i>[pink:]</i>
you can sound the alarm
you can call out your guards
you can fence in your yard
you can hold all the cards
but i won't back down
oh no i won't back down
oh no


yeah! oh! get up! where my dreads at?
i said get up!
you know what happens when i'm around, man
let's go!

better watch out, now
here we come (come)
and we ain't stoppin' until
we see the mornin' sun (sun)
so give us room to do our thing
'cause we ain't come to hurt no one (one)
so everybody come and get up on the floor
now and grab someone (one)

man first of all i'm a boss
i just wanna get that across
man even my dentist hates when i floss
pull up to the club in a pinto like it's a porsche
garbage bag for one of the windows
spray-painted doors with the flames on 'em
michigan plates and my name's on 'em
baby, shady's here come and get him
if you dames want him
but he ain't stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
he's immune to cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
'cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
there's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
we have of just gettin' home, now can i get that lap dance?
she's got a tattoo of me right above her ass man
in the streets of warren, michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
that means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
down and show this hussy who's the man
now, get amped, dance!

now you can do this on your own
but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody!
ain't nothin' but a white trash party!
so let's have us a little bash
and if anyone asks
it ain't no one but us trash
you don't know, you better ask somebody
'cause we're havin' a white trash party!

pull a fifth of bacardi from outta my underwear
and walk around the party without a care
like a body without a head
lookin' like a zombie from night of the livin' dead
and tomorrow i'll probably still be too high to get outta bed
'til i feel like i been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
mixin' hennessy and fanta with pepto and mylanta
i shoot the gift like i'm hollerin' "die santa!"
missed the tree and hit rudolph and two innocent bystanders
so quit tryna play the wall like you paul
and get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
they call me the stephon marbury of rap, darlin'
'cause as soon as they throw on some r. kelly i start ballin'
makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
but i'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
i'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
man i do this for them bunnies up at denny's
from the north, east and west, but when
it comes to them trailers in them south parks
muffle it, 'cause homie that hood's tighter than kenny's
so ladies if your belly button's not an innie then i'm outtie
now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
c'mon

now you can do this on your own
but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody!
ain't nothin' but a white trash party!
so let's have us a little bash
and if anyone asks
it ain't no one but us trash
you don't know, you better ask somebody
'cause we're havin' a white trash party!

now whether you're black, white or purple
if you're misunderstood
but you don't give a fuck
you ain't doin' shit that you should
long as you know you're up to evil
and you're no damn good
get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood
now honey, don't let them pricks trip
we should make a quick dip
and go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot
'cause girl i got a sick whip
kick the back window outta my gremlin
put two milk crates in the trunk
rip out the stick shift and
make a five-seater
i'll be damned if i feed a chick
it ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
i'll be the s-l to the i-m to the s-h-a-d-y
and i don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
i'll rip a tree out the ground
and flip it upside down
'fore i turn over a new leaf, clown
i'll tell you now
i'm so raw i still need to un-thaw
you feel me, y'all?
i shut the club down like drake in the mall
but baby, a body like that's against the law
you the baddest little chain with the blades i ever saw
coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
you got more junk in your trunk than i do in my car
now get up!

now you can do this on your own
but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody!
ain't nothin' but a white trash party!
so let's have us a little bash
and if anyone asks
it ain't no one but us trash
you don't know, you better ask somebody
'cause we're havin' a white trash party!


<i>[ozzy:]</i>
i'm going through changes.
i'm going through changes.

<i>[eminem:]</i>
lately i really feel like i'm rolling for delf like philly,
feel like i'm losing control of myself, i sincerely
apologize if all that i sound like is i'm complaining,
but life keeps on complicating, and i'm debating
on leaving this world this evening,
even my girls can see i'm grievin',
i try and hide it,
but i can't. why do i act like i'm all high and mighty,
when inside i'm dying.
i am finally realizing i need help.
can't do it myself. too weak. two weeks i've been having ups and downs,
going through peaks and valleys,
dilly-dallying 'round with the idea of ending the shit right here.
i'm hatin' my reflection. i walk around the house tryna fight mirrors.
i can't stand what i look like, yeah. i look fat, but what do i care?
i give a fuck. only thing i fear is hailie,
i'm afraid if i close my eyes and i might see her.
shit.

<i>[ozzy:]</i>
i'm going through changes.
i'm going through changes.

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon.
yeah, dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you.
marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
and you falling off with your skills?
and your own fans are laughin' at you?
it become a problem. you're too pussy to tackle, get up.
be a man, stand. a real man would've had this shit handled.
know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed.
they say proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust.
nah, it ain't like doody to do that.
he wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first.
but dwellin' on it only makes the night worse.
now i'm popping vics, percs and methadone pills.
"yeah, em, tight verse. you killed it."
fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men.
and they gon' do whatever i says when i says it.
it's in their best interest to protect their investment.
and i just lost my fuckin' best friend. so, fuck it, i guess then...

<i>[ozzy:]</i>
i'm going through changes.
(don't know what i'm gonna do)
i'm going through changes.
(but i just keep on going through changes.)

my friends can't understand this new me.
that's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be.
you'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
and everybody's lookin' at you. what you want me to do?
i'm startin' to live like a recluse
and the truth is
fame's startin' to give me an excuse
to be at a all-time low.
i sit alone in my home theater watchin' the same damn dvd
of the first tour. the last tour he was still alive.
and it hurts. so, i fast forward. sleepin' pills will make me feel alright.
and if i'm still awake in the middle of the night,
i'll just take a couple more. yeah, you're motherfuckin' right.
i ain't slowin' down for no one, i am almost homeward bound.
almost in a coma. yeah, homie, come on dole 'em out.
"daddy, don't you die on me. daddy, better hold your ground."
fuck, don't i know the sound of that voice?
yeah, baby hold me down.

<i>[ozzy:]</i>
i'm going through changes.
(don't know what i'm gonna do)
i'm going through changes.
(but i just keep on going through changes.)

<i>[eminem:]</i>
wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow i'm pullin' through.
swear when i come back i'mma be bulletproof.
i'mma do it just for proof. i think i should state a few
facts, 'cause i may not get a chance again to say the truth.
shit, it just hit me that what if i would not've made it through?
i think about the things i would've never got to say to you.
i'd never get to make it right. so, here's what i came to do.
hailie, this one is for you, whitney and alaina, too.
i still love your mother, that'll never change.
think about her every day. we just could never get it together.
hey, wish there was a better way for me to say it,
but i swear on everything: i'd do anything for her on any day.
there are just too many things to explain.
when it rains, guess it pours. yes, it does.
wish there wasn't any pain,
but i can't pretend there ain't.
i ain't placin' any blame,
i ain't pointin' fingers. heaven knows i've never been a saint.
i know that it feels like we just pissed away our history.
and just today i looked at your picture, almost if to say
"i miss you" subconsciously. wish it didn't end this way,
but i just had to get away. don't know why.
i don't know what else to say. i guess i'm...

<i>[ozzy:]</i>
i'm going through changes.
(don't know what i'm gonna do)
i'm going through changes.
(but i just keep on going through changes.)


i'm not afraid (i'm not afraid)
to take a stand (to take a stand)
everybody (everybody)
come take my hand (come take my hand)
we'll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just letting you know that you're not alone
holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

yeah, it's been a ride
i guess i had to, go to that place, to get to this one
now some of you, might still be in that place
if you're trying to get out, just follow me
i'll get you there

you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay 'em
but you won't take the sting out these words before i say 'em
'cause ain't no way i'mma let you stop me from causing mayhem
when i say i'mma do something i do it
i don't give a damn what you think
i'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
i'mma be what i set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
and all those who look down on me i'm tearing down your balcony
no ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
from "infinite" down to the last "relapse" album
he's still shitting, whether he's on salary paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
whichever comes first, for better or worse
he's married to the game, like a "fuck you" for christmas
his gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
to pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe

i'm not afraid (i'm not afraid)
to take a stand (to take a stand)
everybody (everybody)
come take my hand (come take my hand)
we'll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just letting you know that you're not alone
holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

okay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
i shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a rap
you said you was king, you lied through your teeth
for that fuck your feelings
instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
and to the fans, i'll never let you down again, i'm back
i promise to never go back on that promise
in fact let's be honest
that last "relapse" cd was "ehh"
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground
relax, i ain't going back to that now
all i'm trying to say is get back, click-clack, blow
'cause i ain't playing around
there's a game called circle and i don't know how, i'm way too up to back down
but i think i'm still trying to figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out but i guess i didn't, this fucking black cloud
still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
these motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

i'm not afraid (i'm not afraid)
to take a stand (to take a stand)
everybody (everybody)
come take my hand (come take my hand)
we'll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just letting you know that you're not alone
holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

and i just can't keep living this way
so starting today, i'm breaking out of this cage
i'm standing up, i'mma face my demons
i'm manning up, i'mma hold my ground
i've had enough, now i'm so fed up
time to put my life back together right now! (now)

it was my decision to get clean, i did it for me
admittedly, i probably did it subliminally
for you, so i could come back a brand-new me you helped see me through
and don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
i've been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye, i feel like the king of
my world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead, no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on, i wanna promise
to focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
and raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
'cause the way i feel, i'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
'cause i'm raising the bar
i'd shoot for the moon but i'm too busy gazing at stars
i feel amazing and i'm...

i'm not afraid (i'm not afraid)
to take a stand (to take a stand)
everybody (everybody)
come take my hand (come take my hand)
we'll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just letting you know that you're not alone
holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)


you, you, you, you, you
like a verbal seduction when...
seduction when i tell them girls on the floor

i don't know, man.
just feels like we're a lot different.
kinda feels like i'm on a whole different page right now than you.
it feels strange but uh, i guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...

i feel like i'm morphing into something that's so incredible that i'm dwarfing all competitors.
better get your girlfriend in check. it's psychological warfare. endorphins i affect.
your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blasting out your deck, "she loves me".
such passion, you'd expect this sort of reaction from her. yet, you strong arm.
you're fucking corny. you try to turn your charm on
'cause you just think you're bishop, the don juan.
but if you think that you're fucking with me, homie you're on one.
i'm cocking my head back like, "ed lover. c'mon son.
she's on my johnson.
she brings my name up constant."
your boys are like, "she's fucking with dude. she wants him."
homeboy, you better get a clue.
she's on my dick 'cause i spit better than you.
what you expect her to do?
how you expect her to act in the sack when she's closing her eyes, fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track.

seduction, seduce. ain't nobody who's as good at what i do,
(it's like a verbal seduction.)
'cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
she's been stolen from you.
(it's like a verbal seduction.)
seduction, seduce. ain't nobody who's as good at what i do,
'cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
she's been stolen from you.
(it's like a verbal seduction.)

she's sitting there getting liquored up at the bar.
she says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are.
there's a seven-disc cd changer in her car, and i'm in every single slot, and you're not. aww.
i'm the logo on that dallas cowboy helmet: a star
and i'm not about to sit back and just keep rhyming one syllable. naw.
switch it up, and watch them haters not give it up 'cause they're just not good enough.
but i'm not giving up 'til i get my respect, and i won't stop 'til i get enough,
'cause i'm not living up to my own expectations. aww.
that hater alarm is sounding off, that obama took the bomb from my name. aww.
so quit crying that i took your dame, homie she's my dame. aww.
you sadly mistaken if you thinking that i'm not on my game, boy.
and things just ain't been the same since the day that i came forth.
you wear your heart on your sleeve. i sport that white tank boy.
but you got a hard on for me. what you hollering my name for?
it's your bitch on my dick. ain't my dang fault. man, i can't call it...

seduction, seduce. ain't nobody who's as good at what i do,
(it's like a verbal seduction.)
'cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
she's been stolen from you.
(it's like a verbal seduction.)
seduction, seduce. ain't nobody who's as good at what i do,
'cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
she's been stolen from you.
(it's like a verbal seduction.)

it's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear. you hear it girl, come here.
put your ear up to the speaker, dear, while i freak this world premier seducing her.
loosen up with a little freestyle that'll wait, am i losing you? am i making you look bad?
well i got news for ya, homie, you losing her. oh wait, she don't like when i spit it fast.
am i trying to show her how? let me slow it down some. it's still gonna be a blow out.
you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album.
rummage through the shit, and try to salvage something to see if you can save any of it,
punk, but none of it's fucking with me. prick, you really feeling that bullshit?
you think you killing them syllables. quit playing. these beats ain't nothing to fool with.
they call me fire marshall. i shut the shit down.
your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round.
i am also the opposite of what you are like.
you are microcosm of what the fuck i am on the mic.
i am awesome and you are just awestruck. she's love-stricken.
she's got her jaw stuck, from sucking my dick. aww, fuck.

seduction, seduce. ain't nobody who's as good at what i do,
(it's like a verbal seduction.)
'cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
she's been stolen from you.
(it's like a verbal seduction.)
seduction, seduce. ain't nobody who's as good at what i do,
'cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't.
she's been stolen from you...
(it's like a verbal seduction.)


love.
don't hurt me.
don't hurt me
no more.
young money...
no more.
love.

<i>[lil wayne:]</i>
throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
but it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing about her
been to hell and back, i can show you vouchers
i'm rolling sweets, i'm smoking sour
married to the game but she broke her vows
that's why my bars are full of broken bottles
and my night stands are full of open bibles, uh.
i think about more than i forget
but i don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
and these niggas know i lay 'em down, make your bed
bitches try to kick me while i'm down: i'll break your leg
money outweighing problems on a triple beam
i'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes, uh.
be good or be good at it
fucking right i've got my gun, semi-cartermatic
yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so i guess it's "fuck what they say"
i'm high as a bitch: up, up and away
man, i'll come down in a couple of days
ok, you want me up in a cage, then i'll come out in beast mode
i got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the g-code
it's weezy motherfucker, blood gang and i'm in bleed mode
all about my dough but i don't even check the peep-hole
so you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
no love lost, no love found

<i>[eminem and lil wayne:]</i>
it's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
you kicked me when i was down
but what you say just (don't hurt me)
that's right bitch (don't hurt me)
and i don't need you (no more)
don't wanna see you (no more)
ha, bitch you get (no love)
you showed me nothing but hate
you ran me into the ground
but what comes around goes around (yeah, yeah)
i don't need you (don't hurt me)
that's right (you don't hurt me)
and i don't need you (no more)
don't wanna see you,
ha, bitch you get (no love, no, no love, no, no love, no, no love)
ha, bitch you get (no love, no, no love, no, no love)
and i don't need you (no more)
get em

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i'm alive again
more alive than i have been in my whole entire life
i can see these people's ears perk up as i begin
to spaz with the pen, i'm a little bit sicker than
most
shit's finna get thick again
they say the competition is stiff
but i get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
i ain't never giving in again
caution to the wind, complete freedom
look at these rappers, how i treat them
so why the fuck would i join 'em when i beat 'em
they call me a freak 'cause
i like to spit on these pussies 'fore i eat them
man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
where the fuck is kanye when you need him?
snatch the mic from him, bitch i'mma let you finish in a minute
yeah that rap was tight
but i'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
so you might wanna go back to the lab tonight and um
scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
and start over from scratch and write new ones
but i'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
when i rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
it's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
from the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
you can see the sparks from hot metal
cold-hearted from the day i bogarted the game
i so started to rock fellow
when i'm not even in my harshest
you can still get roasted 'cause marsh is not mellow
'til i'm toppling from the top i'm not gonna stop
i'm standing on my monopoly board
that means i'm on top of my game and it don't stop
'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
when you're so good that you can't say it
'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
people just get sick 'cause you spit
these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
and you can never break my stride
you never slow the momentum at any moment i'm about to blow
you'll never take my pride
killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent
is getting no mercy, mark my words
ain't letting up, relentless
i smell blood, i don't give a fuck: keep giving them hell
where was you when i fell and needed help up?
you get no love

<i>[eminem and lil wayne:]</i>
it's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
you kicked me when i was down
but what you say just (don't hurt me)
that's right bitch (don't hurt me)
and i don't need you (no more)
don't wanna see you (no more)
ha, bitch you get (no love)
you showed me nothing but hate
you ran me into the ground
but what comes around goes around (around)
i don't need you (don't hurt me)
that's right (you don't hurt me)
and i don't need you (no more)
don't wanna see you,

ha, bitch you get (no love, no, no love, no, no love)
and i don't need you (no more)
bitch, you get (no love)


we touch i feel a rush
we clutch it isn't much
but it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
it's lust, it's torturous
you must be a sorceress 'cause you just
did the impossible
gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
if you fuck me over
'cause if i get burnt i'mma show you what it's like to hurt
'cause i've been treated like dirt before you
and love is "evol"
spell it backwards i'll show you

nobody knows me i'm cold
walk down this road all alone
it's no one's fault but my own
it's the path i've chosen to go
frozen as snow i show no emotion whatsoever so
don't ask me why i have no love for these motherfucking ho's
bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
i've tried in this department but i ain't had no luck with this
it sucks but it's exactly what i thought it would be
like trying to start over
i got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
something i won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over
it's like an explosion every time i hold you, i wasn't joking when i told you
you take my breath away
you're a supernova... and i'm a

i'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
and i'm aiming right at you
right at you
two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in june
and i'm aiming right at you
right at you
right at you

i'll do whatever it takes
when i'm with you i get the shakes
my body aches when i ain't
with you i have zero strength
there's no limit on how far i would go
no boundaries, no lengths
why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same?
you want them when they don't want you
soon as they do feelings change
it's not a contest and i ain't on no conquest for no mate
i wasn't looking when i stumbled onto you must've been fate
but so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
let's cut to the chase
'fore a door shuts in your face
promise me if i cave in and break and leave myself open
that i won't be making a mistake
cause i'm a...

i'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
and i'm aiming right at you
right at you
two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in june
and i'm aiming right at you
right at you
right at you

so after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
but i love you so much it hurts
never mistreated you once
i poured my heart out to you
let down my guard swear to god
i'll blow my brains in your lap
lay here and die in your arms
drop to my knees and i'm pleading
i'm trying to stop you from leaving
you won't even listen so fuck it
i'm trying to stop you from breathing
i put both hands on your throat
i sit on top of you squeezing
'til i snap your neck like a popsicle stick
ain't no possible reason i could think of to let you walk up out this house
and let you live
tears stream down both of my cheeks
then i let you go and just give
and before i put that gun to my temple
i told you this

and i would have did anything for you
to show you how much i adored you
but it's over now
it's too late to save our love
just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause i'm a...

i'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
and i'm aiming right at you
right at you
two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in june
and i'm so lost without you
without you
without you

i'm destroying your livelihood. i ain't just hurtin' your rep',
i catch a flow and get goin',
no remorse i'm showin', ain't slowin' for no one,
knowin' there is nothin' you can do about it
zeroin' on the target like a marksman,
the target is you.

arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva what can you do?

too late for the other side
caught in a chase
twenty-five to life
too late for the other side
caught in a chase
twenty-five to life
(<i>[eminem:]</i> yeah)
too late
(<i>[eminem:]</i> i can't keep chasing 'em
i'm taking my life back)
caught in a chase
twenty-five to life

i don't think she understands the sacrifices that i made
maybe if this bitch had acted right i would've stayed
but i've already wasted over half my life i would've laid
down and died for you i no longer cry for you
no more pain bitch you
took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
into the dirt i can no longer stand it
now my respect i demand it
i'mma take control of this relationship
command it, and i'mma be the boss of you now goddammit
and what i mean is that i will no longer let you control me
so you better hear me out this much you owe me
i gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while i've stayed
faithful all the way this is how i fucking get repaid?
look at how i dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
always in a rush to get back to you i ain't heard you yet
not even once say you appreciate me i deserve respect
i've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
and i know that if i end this i'll no longer have nothing left
but you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step
and i won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
you know what you've done no need to go in depth
i told you, you'd be sorry if i fucking left
i'd laugh while you wept
how's it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it? you neglected me
did me a favor although my spirit free you've set
but a special place for you in my heart i have kept
it's unfortunate but it's

too late for the other side (<i>[eminem:]</i> yeah)
caught in a chase
twenty-five to life
(<i>[eminem:]</i> can't take no more)
too late for the other side
caught in a chase
twenty-five to life

i feel like when i bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
'cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
'til i snap
don't think i'm loyal
all i do is rap
how can i moonlight on the side?
i have no life outside of that
don't i give you enough of my time?
you don't think so, do you?
jealous when i spend time with the girls
why i'm married to you still? man, i don't know
but tonight i'm serving you with papers
i'm divorcing you
go marry someone else and make 'em famous
and take away their freedom like you did to me
treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
i'm moving on forget you oh,
now i'm special? i didn't feel special when i was with you
all i ever felt was this
helplessness
imprisoned by a selfish bitch
chew me up and spit me out
i fell for this so many times
it's ridiculous
and still i stick with this
i'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
you're addictive as they get
evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
my friends keep asking me why i can't just walk away from
i'm addicted
to the pain, the stress, the drama
i'm drawn in so i guess i'm a mess
cursed and blessed
but this time i
ain't changing my mind
i'm climbing out this abyss
you screaming as i walk out that i'll be missed
but when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
you left me off your list

fuck you hip-hop
i'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
and it's just

too late for the other side
caught in a chase
twenty-five to life
(<i>[eminem:]</i> i'm gone, man)
too late for the other side
caught in a chase
twenty-five to life
too late
caught in a chase
twenty-five to life


yeah.
ha ha, you feel that baby?
yeah, i feel it too.
damn.
you know, i'm so glad we could spend this time together

let me tell you the whole story of shady's origin
you'll be sorry if you slam my mercedes door again!
now, it all started with my father
i must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama
i'm a rolling stone just like him, word to johnny drama
keep my entourage with me, baby i'll make a promise
there ain't nobody as bomb as me
i'm as calm as the breeze, i'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms i'm a
s-superstar, girl, i'm ready for you mama!
why you think the only thing i got on is my pyjamas?

<i>[twox]</i>
so bad
so good that i'm so bad

'cause you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

i'm equivalent to a shot of cuevo, first i kiss your navel
work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
but you may wanna find something more stable
i told you i ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of april!
but thank you for staying april, i'mma make you learn

i can hold you in the morning
but in the evening i gotta go.
'cause i'm on to the next girl,
and the next girl i kinda like, oh, oh, oh!

i got you caught up in the rapture
make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped you
you never wanted someone so bad you're sweating
but if i'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when i grabbed you?
girl don't be so frantic i'm just a hopeless romantic
don't try to fight the feeling of something that's so organic
you can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it
just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
damn shorty, i told you this was bound to happen
soon as you wrote your number on a napkin i was bound to work a number on your back and
throw your spine out of alignment
my love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick amy winehouse out of a lineup
so stop at a store, pick a pint up
let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock 'cause i'mma hang a sign up
saying "don't disturb", shorty i'm so superb

ha ha.
dr. dre
two thousand and ten!
light years ahead of you, ha ha.
who!


i can almost taste it
this shit makes no sense to me
what does it all mean?
i can almost taste it
i can almost see it
this shit makes no sense to me
what does it all mean?
i can almost taste it

yeah, can't stop now.
(i can almost taste it.)
this may be the last chance i get to be famous.
(i just wanna be famous).

you dream of trading places,
i have been changing faces
you cannot fill these shoes,
there is too much to lose.
wake up behind these trenches,
you run around defenseless.
there is too much to lose,
you cannot fill these shoes
i just wanna be famous,
but be careful what you wish for

i stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
they call me slim roethlisberger
i go berserker than a fed-up post-office worker
i murk her with a mossberg
i'm pissed off, get murdered
like someone took a ketchup squirter
squirted a frankfurter
for a gangster you sure did shit your pants
when you saw the chainsaw get to waving
like a terrible towel
how thangs turn around
when his fangs come out
get your brains blown out
that's what i call blowing your mind
when i cum back
like nut on your spine
i'm the thumb tack
that you slept on, son
now here i come screaming "attack!"
like i just stepped on one
low on the totem 'til he showed 'em
defiance, giant scrotum
he don't owe them bitches shit
his britches, he out growed 'em
he's so out cold he's knocked out at the south pole
and nobody fucks with him
rigor mortis and post mortem
he's dying of boredom
take your best rhymes, record 'em
to try to thwart him
he'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
shit-stained drawers
you gon' fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
while he dips 'em in pf chang's sauce
game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
you think i'm backing down?
you must be out of your dang skulls
i'm almost famous

you dream of trading places,
i have been changing faces
you cannot fill these shoes,
there is too much to lose.
wake up behind these trenches,
you run around defenseless.
there is too much to lose,
you cannot fill these shoes
i just wanna be famous,
but be careful what you wish for

i'm back for revenge
i lost a battle that ain't happening again
i'm at your throat like strep
i step, strapped with a pen
metaphors wrote on my hand,
some are just stored in my memory
some i wrote on a napkin
i do what i have to to win
pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
not even austin powers, how the fuck are they mike myers
and tell that psycho to pass the torch
to the whacko 'fore i take a shit in his jack-o-lantern
and smash it on his porch
now get off my dick
"dick"'s too short of a word for my dick
get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
don't call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
i just blew up the challenger, matter fact i need a lawyer
i just laced my gloves with enough plaster
to make a cast, beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like verne troyer
ya'll are eminem backwards, you're meni mes
see he's in a whole 'nother weight class
he slugs, you're bbs, you're bean-bag bullets
you're full of it; you were dissin' his cds
laughed at infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
no peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
his new slim shady ep's got the attention of the mighty d. r. e.
he's almost famous

you dream of trading places,
i have been changing faces
you cannot fill these shoes,
there is too much to lose.
wake up behind these trenches,
you run around defenseless.
there is too much to lose,
you cannot fill these shoes
i just wanna be famous,
but be careful what you wish for

now there he goes in dre's studio cuppin' his balls
screaming the wood off the panelling
and cussing the paint off the walls
spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads
he ain't given 'em shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
he'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
when it scars, 'til abraham lincoln is screaming out, "awww!"
his metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
if they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
they can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by
like david carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
and eat shit while they at it
he's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
so go to hell and build a snowman, girl
the bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
then they better pull me, take me back to nineth grade to school me
'cause i ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
who could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
and while i'm being poetic let me get historic and raise the bar
higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
so bear witness to some biblical shit
as a cold wind blowing
this world ain't gonna know what hit it
he did it, he made it, he's finally famous


<i>[rihanna:]</i>
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well, that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well, that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i can't tell you what it really is
i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now, it's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight
high off her love, drunk from her hate
it's like i'm huffing paint and i love her the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
she fucking hates me and i love it
"wait! where you going?"
"i'm leaving you!"
"no you ain't. come back"
we're running right back
here we go again
it's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful, i feel so ashamed i snap
"who's that dude?"
"i don't even know his name"
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength

<i>[rihanna:]</i>
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well, that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well, that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

<i>[eminem:]</i>
you ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feeling
yeah, them chills used to get 'em
now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
you swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
you push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
throw 'em down, pin 'em
so lost in the moments when you're in them
it's the rage that took over
it controls you both
so they say it's best to go your separate ways
guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
yesterday is over, it's a different day
sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
next time you'd show restraint
you don't get another chance
life is no nintendo game
but you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane

<i>[rihanna:]</i>
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well, that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well, that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

<i>[eminem:]</i>
now i know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
and we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
but your temper's just as bad as mine is
you're the same as me
when it comes to love you're just as blinded
baby, please come back
it wasn't you, baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault
look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed, i'll aim my fist at the drywall
next time? there won't be no next time!
i apologize even though i know it's lies
i'm tired of the games i just want her back
i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fucking leave again
i'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
i'm just gonna

<i>[rihanna:]</i>
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well, that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well, that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie


the days are cold living without you (without you)
the nights are long, i'm growing older
i miss the days of old thinking about you (thinking about you)
you may be gone but you're never over

if proof could see me now i know he'd be proud
somewhere in me deep down there's something in me he found
that made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
you try it'll be them doors on dre's phantom, believe me clowns
that means "suicide" homie, you'll never throw me
off of this course, blow me
bitch, i do this all for the sport only
but i want it all
i'm not just talking awards, homie
and the balls in my court and it's lonely
on top of the world when you're the only
one with the balls in your shorts
to leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
remember that when they get to dogging you boy, homie
so ya'll can just get to blogging about bologna,
i'm not gonna stop, the saga continues
no stopping the force, obi
i'm mopping the floors with 'em
i keep trying to pass it
but they keep on dropping the torch
and it won't be long 'til this sport is o-v-e-r
just blaze and me we are knocking on doors
and no, we ain't pumpkins on halloween
but we'll show up on your porch,
so be careful what you say
there ain't no punks over here, so follow me
through the fog like i'm s-n double o-p
let me guide you through the smoke g
if only i wasn't travelling down this road by my lonely
no one who knew me like you will ever know me
i don't think you understand how much you meant to me

the days are cold living without you (without you)
the nights are long i'm growing older
i miss the days of old thinking about you (thinking about you)
you may be gone but you're never over

and it don't stop oh
and it don't quit oh
and it don't stop oh
and it don't quit oh
and i miss you oh
i just miss you oh
i just miss you oh
and homie i'll never forget you, no

for you i wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
so sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
yeah it'll make the dopest mc wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
tap-dancing all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
guess that the best thing i could do right now, doody, for you is to rap
so i'm gonna fuck 'til i die, yeah, i'mma do it to death
and instead of mourning your death i'd rather celebrate your life
elevate to new height
step on the gas and accelerate, i'mma need two mics
'cause the way that i'm feeling tonight, everything i can just do right
there's nothing that i can do wrong, i'm too strong and i'm just too hyped
just finish the rhyme and bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
but they'll never catch up to all this energy that i've mustered
so god just help me out while i fight through this grieving process
trying to process this loss is making me nauseous
but this depression ain't taking me hostage
i've been patiently watching, this game pacing these hallways
you had faith in me always
proof, you knew i'd come out of this slump rise from these ashes
come right back on they asses and go mike tyson on these bastards
and i'mma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
i'mma own so many belts the only place they can hit me is below 'em
homie, i know i'm never gonna be the same without you
i never would've came in this game i'm going insane without you
matter of fact it was just the other night
had another dream about you
you told me to get up, i got up, i spread my wings and i flew
you gave me a reason to fight, i was on my way to see you
you told me, "nah, doody, you're not laying on that table i knew."
i was gonna make it soon as you said, "think of hailie," i knew
there wasn't no way that i was ever gonna leave them babies and proof
not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
lord i'm so thankful, please don't think that i don't feel grateful, i do
just grant me the strength that i need for one more day to get through
so, homie, this is your song, i dedicate this to you
i love you, doody

the days are cold living without you (without you)
the nights are long i'm growing older
i miss the days of old thinking about you (thinking about you)
you may be gone but you're never over

and it don't stop oh
and it don't quit oh
and it don't stop oh
and it don't quit oh
and i miss you oh
i just miss you oh
i just miss you oh
and homie i'll never forget you no


(you don't own me. don't try to change me)
nah man
not quite finished yet

girl, i think,
you just might've tried to pull a motherfucking fast one, i'm mad
you just hurt my goddamn feeling, and that was the last one i had
does this look like an arcade? tryna play games?
see this saw blade? see the silhouette of a stalker
in your walk-way? better co-operate
or get sautã©ed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
mcs get so quiet you can hear a motherfucking dog whistle when i walk by
'colt seavers' on a mule, stunting on that ass like the fucking fall guy
i don't gas my mercedes after midnight, i treat it like a mogwai
'cause it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids, women and men
vrinn-vrinn! motor's so big you can fit a midget in his engine
bitch, give me them digits, why you're cringin'
not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
will i spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when
do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny?
shit, if i think a penny's pretty
just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
eenie meenie miney mo,

while he's trying to roll a snowball,
but don't make him lose his cool
if he hollers better let him go ya'll, 'cause (you don't own me)

'cause, you can bet your ass that we gon' get it crackin'
like the kraken and titans when they're clashin'
get your brains bashed in so bad
you gon' have kurt cobain askin'
to autograph a bloodstained napkin
unfashionable and 'bout as rational
as a rash on a fag's asshole
now let's take that line, run it up the flag pole with elton

i ain't in the mood for this shit
get my dick, google it 'til it pops up
ya'll are so motherfucking full of shit that you're stopped up

'cause i'm a fucking problem, run boy!
every flow got it mastered
so every last word that you fucking fags heard
comes straight from the fish's ass, yeah
in other words i'm a bass-turd!
looking at me like i killed kenny
gas in the tank, yeah still plenty
no morals are instilled in me
so remorse i really don't feel any

understandable why you're jealous, fucking animal
i got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now, can ya hoe?
shady, i don't understand your flow.

aw man...
yeahâ¦
you ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
and people that you don't even know jump in?

you feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, you're pissed
you just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
you're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, i'm just inches away
from splitting your shit wide open, no stitches can save
you'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
you end up going out, but i guess it just is i'm afraid
razors, scissors and blades make jason say, "isn't this great?"
on-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
that's starting to take place in the middle of the street
little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
emergency personnel rush to the murder scene but it's too late
it's absolute pandemonium
whisked away in an ambulance is your fate
nothing nobody told you when you left the house today
could of made you anticipate
such an ass-whipping, okay
'til the anger dissipates
you get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on

so what the deal ridaz?
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
so what the deal ridaz?
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

you step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
you better go get your mace 'cause shady said so
you may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
that's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now you still wanna grill?
if you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
'cause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill
i got a couple of drinks here, and i'm bound to refill
girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
this cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh hell nah
he must be trying to kill my buzz
i will not budge, so what the deal ridaz?
now here they all come and they got your back in like two seconds flat
and that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
'cause they want in on the act, there's a cognac bottle
we snuck it in 'cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap
i'm biting, i fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
you're frightened like "this guy might hurt me"
you're quite certain he's nuts, i've hit myself in the face harder
play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
dig your way out or go powder your nose
pussy the louder you yell the harder i slap the shit outta you hoes
you set it off faggot so now how do you 'spose
we settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes

so what the deal ridaz?
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
so what the deal ridaz?
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

it's sheer hustle, i bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
we're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us and
adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing
too much budweiser in my blood, i'm strangling your windpipe for nothing
my signature ligature marks, look at you all
big with your remarks 'til i swing an icepick at your heart
at least that's what it feels like when i pick you apart
and dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
the predicament starts when i throw a brick at your car
the pain inflicted upon you is so sick it's bizarre
shit this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
as having me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ah
you hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
you catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
in fact i'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
where's dtwelve? i don't feel like doing this by myself, come on

so what the deal ridaz?
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
so what the deal ridaz?
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

yeah, what the deal?
i'm feeling hard as hell right now homie
i almost feel... invincible and shit
ay dre! you got me feeling like i can't be touched right now fool
i'm unstoppable
damn


<i>[eminem:]</i>
ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
aww shit, yeah
y'all ready to get this shit started or what?
aight, well i brought some friends with me too

now i ain't back just for the sake of just saying i'm back
i could relax but i'd rather stack ammo on tracks
couple xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
out and relapse 'til i yack jack daniels and 'gnac
burp bubbles, attitude's immaturing
double shot of bacardi, party, vision is blurring
whoa-oh, i can't see shit, my words get to slurring
uh-oh! you can call me r. kelly now, you're in trouble!
what's occurring before, after and during the show
has no bearing on the bad news i'm bearing, whoa
what is it, wordplay? no i'm pushing you out the door
so suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
now stomp your fuckin' feet 'til you get to squishing a hoe
it's pandemonium standing know when you see him, oh
damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
you should, pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood
it's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
break bread while i'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? i'm kanye when he crashed
in other words i got the hood on smash like i stepped on the gas
destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
went through 'em and laughed
came back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn jawbreaker in half!
so stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass
slaughterhouse in the house with the caucasian of rap
and just blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
slut, answer me that, royce where you at?

<i>[royce da five'nine":]</i>
i'm right here fire marshall, verbal pair of pliers i pry apart you
lump on your head designed by a bar stool
designed by a cartoon
before i need to be hired, jimmy io' fire marshall
the nine tucked against the lining
i pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple sixty-nineing
it's like rick james is shooting up your house nigga!
fuck yo' couch nigga!
you're screaming, "fuck the world!" with your middle finger up
while i'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
my bitch, know i'm perfectly fit, for murder
because i murdered her, so you can call me nickel to o.j. to glove
i got a posse of insane clowns
blow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds
bad, evil, we go alfred e. neuman mad cerebral
you on your last burrito!
(what that mean nickel?) it's a wrap if you eating
get a beat then terrorize that bitch like i'm middle eastern
slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touching that
good day and good night, ortiz yo where the fuck you at?

<i>[joell ortiz:]</i>
i'm right here in my nike airs, buzz light-years
ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
where my book at? i write fear in the heart of you tight squares
i harbor the art, of you nice wear
it's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
uncle al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
homie chill, listen, i swear
i'm god, i give tracks a holy-feel, and they bite ears
i'm right here, why wouldn't i be?
just waiting to be hooked to iv as mumm-ra's
well when you look at my pee
and this joint, no exception, so just point a direction
and record the pig's oink, when i rip his intestine
this isn't just an infection
this won't go away with penicillin injections
millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what i exhibit
seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
aw shiddit, i did it again, when i liddift this pen
i emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside emiddinem
so tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is crook?

<i>[crooked i:]</i>
i'm right here letting the shottie pop, quick as a karate chop
get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
call it maserati drop, in the body shop
get your mommy knocked, and your uncle tommy molli-wopped
i take your life to the ninth inning
a knife in the gunfight, i love it, me and my knife winning
i laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
i'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this impala
i ball like iguodala, i bear more arms than six koalas
as soon as i draw, get sent to allah
bilinguist don, i kill with the tongue, i'm atilla the hun
i'm genghis khan, i'm a genius spawn
i pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
a syllable gun, real as they come, long beach saddam!
slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are south flying
we do it to try to do without trying
(slaughterhouse!) 'cause to us it's so easy
where's jumpoff joe beezy?


i told the world one day i would pay it back
say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day i could play it back

they ask me am i okay, they ask me if i'm happy
are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me

this is a beat with no words at first, itâs a blank painting
exercising the mind, itâs brain strength training

my motto is live by the bottle
so why is my supply low? bring in a truckload with a high-low

my name is chauncey billups, i'm kind of like a raunchy phillips
screwdriver, my crew's live when you can't sleep and you're still up

i came in this game with, bad intentions
and i ain't budged, not even an inch since then

lava on my lips i flips, wake up think i have a cramp
i'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass

got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
i'm gonna step up on this stage now, i'm gonna strut

shady man, i done told you once homie to easy up
but you just wonât listen will ya? nah, i guess not


yeah, yeah, i get it
i run this rap shit, now guess whoâs back
you thought i left you, now why would i do that? (one, two, three)

they keep on sayinâ the same rappers are the best
jay-z and kanye west, maybe theyâre just tryna distract it
from the fact that iâm cominâ back
or maybe itâs cause i ainât black, maybe itâs because of that
maybe itâs because iâm the highest sellinâ artist in rap
while iâm sittinâ back in my office jackinâ off to my plaques
iâm still sick, how can i be sick this long
and iâm still alive, magic johnson arise
i thrive on makinâ my opponents think that iâve died
thatâs when i just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
damn i forgot how much money he got
on the beach of saint-tropez, but your man donât lay
in the sun cause i donât tan, i burn, blood clot
when you gonna learn how much money weâve earned
how does it feel to know i came in this game at twenty-five
and coulda retired at twenty-nine in my twentyâ²s still
and fifâ here to lick on that coca-cola shit
and he ainât even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
no more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
to go from sellinâ bags to bottles right out the store
and shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
my ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
so stay the fuck off us, we make pay
iâm just a super easy modest mc, okay?
til i hear the word has been, thatâs when i start spazzinâ
smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
iâm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
iâm a blonde dre, now gimme kanyeâs glasses!


<i>[obie trice:]</i>
obie the person that came up introverted
cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict
it was worth it cause he changed became so observant
serving such of a purpose
if you knew him earlier in his days its like a different version
so much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
that's why there's curtains in this murder if you gettin' worked up
i'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher
i had enough of isolating myself in a room
writing poems and songs, doin' the same in school
now look what he became, a fool?
cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
living hard but still juliard a god walks in but ain't spend a day in the pew
regardless of this i draw visual pictures when a nigga vents
so welcome to the art department

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i stimulate the brain, mimic, emulate the sane
cinic keep em' thinking its a fucking gimmick when it ain't
clinically insane, brain is on venus suck uranus
label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
he may seem as though he's plain normal
if you ever meet him, greet him with a shake, see
he ain't as mean as what they say
see the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
so he's vague, so they mistake him for just bein' crazed
you part ways, your impression of him changed
you don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him "peace and thanks"
then you catch him flipping you off, with his pants down
hands around his scrotum, tucking his fucking penis between his legs

am i psycho or some kind of psychotic stick,
or am i truly psychotic, or my molecules just diabolical,
cause biologically i defy logic, bye golly hall me off  on a trolly, probably wanna cracker, i'm back on the wacky tobacco,
i'm a step away from crack obie smack the shit outta me,
i'm so slap happy man, snap me back to reality,
ima walking art gallery, a science museum,
elephantiasis of the nuts you probably die if you see em,
i pull em out they hit the ground and probably crack the cement,
i need an ambulance i cant just put em back in my pants


<i>[eminem - chorus]</i>
there's no need to say shit you already know
the question is just how far will this go
how far will he take it?
and when will he stop?
shady man i done told you once homie to easy up
but you just won't listen will ya, nah i guess not
you just can't can ya, man i can't stand ya
you're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
man when are you gonna let up
i guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

holy toledo it's angelina jolie amigo
she told me yo shady just hand your penis to me i'll deep throat
and brad if you try to stand between us then we're gonna see bro
who was a fantasy i don't mean to damage your ego
you faggots wanna rassle i shove a fucking jar of vaseline up inside your asshole
and rope it shut with a lasso
couple of crushed lexapro broken up wit the capsule or paxil
just incase i ain't dope enough wit the raps though
coke is cut with tobacco
smoke it up then go wacko
this is what happens when you mix a cocunut with tabasco
shady let go, the hoe has been choked up enough
let her ass go
not till jessica simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
i used to love her hooters now carmen elektra cuter
strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
i'm off my fucking meds but i'm on an electric scooter
i might just scoot by and shoot my mum in the neck with rugers
spit in jasons face while i vomit on freddy krugar
they can't even get jeffrey dahmer to pet the cougar
now i'm gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
cation and get the patient some darvocet to chew cuz

<i>[eminem - chorus]</i>

b.o.b i done told you once homie to easy up, geez
there's no need to say shit you already know
the question is just how far will this go
cause i will never lay down?
and i will never let up?
(i guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better)

<i>[b.o.b - verse two]</i>
with the soul of a sharman
i leave the beat than vomit
like a bullemic woman with an uneasy stomach
i pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
so can you hear me coming
eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
it's probably go diseases on it
i'm just being honest, i can see the comments
i can see the evolution as we creep up on it
i put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
shit i just do this for the haters, i don't need the money
i diarrhea on track so it needs plunging
somebody tell these girls please release my undies
nobody really understands my language
i find it complicated just to hold a conversation
but still i got a whole lot of patience
sittin' back watching earth from my space station

oh my gosh i put natasha bendingfield in a washer
watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
its like i got ya hypnotising like i gotcha
i gotcha pychologically fucked
michael would like an apology what
tell that psycho to stick a tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
and glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
i'm as cold as a muthafucking icicle on my nut
i aint nuttin' nice, man i like to pull knives and i like to cut
the poster addict for post tramatic stress
i guess this is the most dramatic i've been in a while
this is the closest that its come to the marshall mathers
i can hear him start to gather
i don't paint the portrait of the picture perfect partridge family
this ain't your orphan annie, no this is more uncanny
kick down dakota fannings front door while the whore is tanning
(he can't say whore)
of course he can, man he just saw her fanny then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties

we're drinkin' it's been a couple of days, since i've slept
my dick is sore from fuckin', when i bust there's nothin' left
just dust, back on the stage, give me my microphone

i heard a noise, where you goin'? what are you, bananas?!

of whipped cream what the hell you gonna do with that?
i'm a put it on my wee wee. ooh, good answer!
a super bonanza extravaganza.

a beastiality porno with smoothies.

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three:]</i>
it's eerie, but here comes zack and miri
the "beauty and the beast", his back is hairy.
but she don't care, they're attractive, very
very sexually active, very.

it's too late now, she's grabbin' hair!
he screams: "bloody mary!" - grabs a mirror
but stop just ain't in her vocabular.
"get off me, please! get off me, stop!"
ballin' back at a coffee shop.
they go non-stop. - she says: "go!"
he says: "no! " - she says: "oh!"
back and forth, they scream and shout.
yeah, boy; let them demons out!
it's the kinda nightmare you dream about
uh-oh! now the whipped cream is out.
i get sick thoughts. - sick, sick, thoughts.
the things you could do with your lipstick gloss.

i'm a goat
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and i consider myself one of those
so thank you very much, here it goes!

this is the part i was worried about
everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
and i'm in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes
and everyone's telling me what i should do
and how i should come out and what to rap about
and i know i got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that i gotta get out
and i'm not sure how this is gonna come off
they're probably gonna think that i'm coming off as cocky (haha)
like i just started giving a fuck what you really think about me
see, the thing about me
is you don't really know a thing about me
everyone's making a stink about me
like there's some kind of a aura of that of the king around me
surround me with nothin' but gangsters, killers, and bangers
and the most dangerous criminals
and i feel like i'm more comfortable around them than i do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
but, see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when i leave
but why does it seem like i'm not even put up in the same category as other emcees?
so when weezy says that he's better than jay-z
please, be that just subliminally
means he thinks jigga's the best and that he's
the only one up in that league, see
and it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
knowing god damn well that i'm one of the best motherfucking rappers who ever lived period.

i'm a goat
and i don't mean to gloat
but i know what i know and i know what you think
and these magazines'll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and i consider myself one of those
so thank you very much, here it goes!

maybe they figure that i'm on my way out the game
so they gotta go try to find em a new eminem
or a new shady, if they think it's gonna happen
man, i thought i was crazy
or maybe i could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
see, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that paul wall's white
cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
and bubba sparxxx, he just won't write
because he's so caught up in that snow white
that timbaland can't even get him in the studio
he's so gone off that coke, right
and it's so sad, cause he's dope, right
america's next great white hope, right
so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show, right
and which i'm still havin' mixed feelings about
they said it'd be real, i'm just spillin' it out
there's somethin' about a white boy talking black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
and i love when the say that tiger woods shit
"isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black?"
and i'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack offa' that
but these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until eight mile had came out
but i had already hit middle america
parents had all got to likin' me now
when suddenly i wasn't such a bad guy
all of the hatred for me must've died
thought i committed career suicide so i had to turn back into the bad guy
so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
and anatomy god made raggedy ann and andy
not raggedy andy and andy and andy
and angelina jolie is just another ho
and brad is a sucka' because once i fuck her
she wants to go to somalia to adopt another baby
you know what i say? no
you better save some of them kids from madonna
she needs all the publicity she can get
you want a shady? well, you got it, man
i ain't apologizin' for shit.

i'm a goat
and i don't mean to gloat
but i know what i know and i know what you think
and these magazines'll never put it in ink
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat?
and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is
it means the greatest of all time
and i consider myself one of those
so thank you very much, here it goes!

man, i'm takin' my ball and goin' home, man
shit is too easy
nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause
(i'm a goat)
so don't worry, i'm out the motherfuckin' game
and y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
but y'all know that
(i'm a goat)
and like i said, i'm one of the motherfuckin' best
before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
but before i go, i'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start
and thank you very much to everybody who was
and y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
cause i know that you know that i know that you know that i know that you know
(i'm a goat)
(hahahaha)
i'm out, y'all
it's been real, peace


<i>[intro]</i>
i'm a little nutty and i know it
but if you go back and
take a look at my history
you will see that i'm
not the only one who's off his rocker
there were many before me 
i was always labelled
the black sheep of the family what a bad seed i
grow to be but if you take a look
at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree

<i>[verse one]</i>
(haha) alright, look
i'ma tell you the story
from my side maybe you'll understand check it out 
you done witnessed
unexplainable shit
too insane to explain
people run from what
the just don't get
maybe shady shoulda
just hit 'em with a little bit
did i spit too soon?
should i of spoon fed 'em it?
but i was just so eager
to prove i was even worth
being in the same
league or the room with of the people
of whom i was in every now and then i
look up like i was seeking approval
was it because of the
pigment of my skin
or was it a figment of
my imagination
maybe it bothered me
more than it did them
maybe it wasn't a big
deal back then
but to me it was, see
what it was was
i had developed the
complex from being judged
proof spit his verse,
now i'm next, let's see who
i'm in the booth
staring back to see who's mugs
i get a reaction from,
usually the first thumb was from
proof
and the rest of the
group backed him up
and no one lied to
each other cause none of us had deals
it was real, we just
wanted tickets for that meal

<i>[chorus]</i>
sometimes i feel like
it's just me
sometimes i feel like
i'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
i said ...
sometimes i feel like
it's just me
sometimes i feel like
i'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree

<i>[verse two]</i>
ever since my mother
was pregnant
with her second egg
cause she said
that i had a baby sister
who fell out of the window
i was too young to remember
kansas city projects
i was like five, six, and how come
i remember malcolm,
isaac, and boogie
if it was the projects in missouri?
cause those're my best
friends until isaac
took my tricycle and
my uncle todd went to try to go get it back
and ended up getting
jumped and cut in the gut with a
switch and seventy-some stitches
which is still, to this day
why my mother still
tries to show me some old fake picture
of a fictitious little
sister who never existed and this is why part of
my life's so twisted
but i can never be as
sick as that bitch is
and, by the way, that
picture's one of my relatives

<i>[chorus]</i> 
sometimes i feel like
it's just me
sometimes i feel like
i'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
i said ...
sometimes i feel like
it's just me
sometimes i feel like
i'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree

<i>[verse three]</i>
you probably have to
peel back layers upon layers of
pain to see why everything
i say is so insane
what's different about my brain that separates me
from other players in this game? on the surface, it may
seem like a scheme or some sort of scam
for me to get some damn sympathy
but that's the last thing
i need is for people
to walk around feeling
sorry for me (me)
and i'm not a g, never
claimed to be
i gave my vest to
cashis,
he'll need it more than me
but we'll see, cause we ain't lookin' for beef
but if it comes our
way, what do we, turn the other
cheek? come on

<i>[chorus]</i>
sometimes i feel like
it's just me
sometimes i feel like
i'm going crazy
but take a look at my family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree
i said ...
sometimes i feel like
it's just me
sometimes i feel like
i'm going crazy
but take a look at my
family
cause the apple don't
fall too far from the tree

<i>[eminem - verse one:]</i>

especially when the worlds silly putty in ya hands, its playdough
i aint got to play though, they say i died in a fatal
car crash, shows what they know
shit if i did, itâd be a trailer not a car
the white trash star

i just couldânt seem to get back and recapture that magic
so i went back to the lab, thats where iâve been at when...

<i>[just blaze - chorus:]</i>

howâs that for hindsight, what the track say?

<i>[just blaze - chorus]</i>


<i>[eminem:]</i>
it's like i'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
all it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
and left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
maybe i needed to grow up a little first
well, looks like i hit a growth spurt
but i am coming for closure
don't suppose an explanation i'm owed for
the way that you turned your back on me
just when i may have needed you most
oh, you thought it was over
you could just close the chapter
and go about your life, like it was nothing
you ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
well, i've never recovered but tonight i betcha that whatcha
'bout to go through's tougher than anything i ever have suffered
can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
can i hold grudges, mind saying, "let it go, fuck this."
heart's saying, "i will once i bury this bitch alive.
hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."

<i>[sarah jaffe:]</i>
i flee the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through
oh, you had me pegged the first time
you can see the truth
but it's easier to justify
what's bad is good
and i hate to be the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy

<i>[eminem:]</i>
and to think i used to think you was the shit, bitch
to think it was you at one time i worshiped, shit
think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew (sic), knit wit
thought some time had past and i'd forget it, forget it!
you left our family in shambles
you expect me to just get over him? pretend he never existed
may be gone, but he's not forgotten
and don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long
that i've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
you're wrong and that shit was rotten
and the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold
have you any idea the shit that i've gone through?
feelings i harbor, all this pent-up resentment i hold on to
not once you call to ask me how i'm doing
letters, you don't respond to 'em
fuck it, i'm coming to see you
and gee who better to talk to than you?
the 'cause of my problems
my life is garbage and i'm 'bout to take it out on you
poof, then i'm gone, voosh
and...

<i>[sarah jaffe:]</i>
i flee the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through
oh, you had me pegged the first time
you can see the truth
but it's easier to justify
what's bad is good
and i hate to be the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i've been driving around your side of this town
like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
finally i found your new address, park in your drive
feel like i been waiting on this moment all of my life
and it's now arrived, and my mouth is fulla' saliva
my knife is out and i'm ducking on the side of your house
see, it's sad it came to this point
such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya
but i ain't here for ya empathy, i don't need your apology
or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that i seek
so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
like i reach my full potentialâi peeked
continue to peep, still bent low
keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
you don't plan for intruders beforehand?
surprised to see me? cat got your tongue?
gag, chloroform rag, dag almost hack-up a lung
like you picked an axe up and swung
stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk
by one of your fans, irony's spectacular, huh?
now who's a faggot, you punk?
and here's your bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
it's just me, you and the music now, slim
i hope you hear it we're in a car right now
wait, here comes my favorite lyric
i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
and hey, here's a sequel to my mathers lp
just to try to get people to buy
well how's this for publicity stunt? this should be fun
last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
eminem killed by m and m
matthew mitchell, bitch, i even have your initials
i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
since you're in love with your city so much
i figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
two more exits, time is quite near
i hope we don't get stopped, no license i fear
that sirens i hear? guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(oh god, police! ah!)
hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
new plan stan
slim, "chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car!"
well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
slim, this is for him and frank ocean, hope you can swim good!
now say you hate homos again!

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
i'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and then woke up still in
i'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
nope, it's hopeless, i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
when they say all of this is approaching its end
but you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
back's to the wall, i'm stacking up all them odds, toilet's clogged
yeah 'cause i'm talking a lotta shit but i'm backing it all up
but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
after the track is demolished
"i am your lack of a conscience"
i'm the ringing in your ears
i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
eating your vocal chords after your concerts
i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
i'm the bullies you hate that you became
with every faggot you slaughtered
coming back on you every woman you insult, batter
but the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted
'cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona's half a faã§ade and
matthew and stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
'cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,
i'm the hindsight to say, "i told you so!"
foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
if you don't stop after they call you
biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
when it's time to walk away
i'm every guilt trip the baggage you have
but as you gather up all your possessions
if there's anything you have left to say
unless it makes an impact then don't bother
so before you rest your case
better make sure you're packing a wallop
so one last time, i'm back
before it fades into black and it's all over
behold the final chapter in the saga
trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
twice, the magic that started it all
tragic portrait of an artist tortured
trapped in his own drawings
tap into thoughts
blacker and darker than anything imaginable
here goes a wild stab in the dark
as we pick up where the last mathers' left off


<i>[verse one:]</i>
(what's your name?) marshall
(who's your daddy?) i don't have one
my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
and had me on the back of a motorcycle
then crashed in the side of locomotive with rap, i'm loco
it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
about to explode all over the canvas
back with the yoda of rap in a spasm
(your music usually has them)
(but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't)
(follow you must, rick rubin my little padawan)
a jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts of entertaining
but docile and impossible to explain and, i'm also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting
puke skywalker, but sound like chewbacca when i talk
full of such blind rage i need a seeing eye dog
can't even find the page, i was writing this rhyme on (oh..)
its on a rampage, couldn't see what i wrote i write small
(it says) ever since i drove a seventy-nine lincoln with white walls
had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to die hard
so as long as i'm on the clock punching this time card
hip hop ain't dying on my watch

<i>[hook:]</i>
but sometimes, when i'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams
is she taken? is she mine? don't got, i don't care, don't have two shits to give
let me take you by the hand, to promise land, and threaten everyone
'cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

<i>[bridge:]</i>
nah, (what's your name?) marshall
(who's your daddy?) i don't know him, but i wonder
(is he rich like me?) ha ha
(has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)
no

<i>[verse two:]</i>
if he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
i wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad
i'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens
when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
makes you want to get up and start dancing
even if it is charles manson who just happens, to be rapping
blue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank
lamping in my k-mart mansion, i'm in the style department
with a pile in my cart, ripping the aisle apart
with great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content
completely, despondent, and condescending
the king of nonsense and controversy is on a
beat killing spree, your honor, i must plead
guilty, 'cause i sparked a revolution
rebel without a cause, who caused the evolution of rap
to take it to the next level, boost it
but several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(hip hop is the devil's music) is that me? it belongs to me?
'cause i just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns
that don't honk but every time i speak you, hear a beep?
but lyrically i never hear a peep, not even a whisper
rappers better stay clear of me, bitch
'cause it's theâ¦

<i>[hook]</i>
it's the time of the season, when hate runs high
and this time i won't give it to you easy
when i take back what's mine, with pleasured hands
and torture everyone, that is my plan, my job here isn't done
'cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

<i>[bridge:]</i>
(whats your name?) shady
(who's your daddy?) i don't give a fuck, but i wonder
(is he rich like me?) doubt it, ha
(has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)

<i>[verse three:]</i>
so yeah dad let's walk
let's have us a father and son talk
but i bet we wouldn't probably get one block
without me knocking your block off
this is all your fault
maybe that's why i'm so bananas
i appeal to all those walks of life
whoever had strife
maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'cause i related to the struggles of young america
when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
now they're ripping out their fucking hair again
it's hysterical, i chuckle
'cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckle heads
the sign on my hustle says "don't knock"
the door's broken, it won't lock
it might just fly open, get cold-cocked
you critics come pay to me a visit
misery loves company, please stay a minute
kryptonite to a hypocrite
zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
too busy getting stoned in your glass house
to kick rocks, then you wonder why i lash out
mister mathers as advertised on the flyers
so spread the word 'cause i'm promoting my passion 'til i'm passed out
completely brain dead rainman
doing the bankhead in a restraint chair
so bitch, shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
or get shanked in the pancreas, i'm angrier than
all eight of the reindeer put together with chief keef
'cause i hate every fucking thing, yeah
even this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look
for a fucking reason for it that ain't there
i still am a criminal
ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals
the last mathers lp done went diamond
this time i'm predicting that this one will go emerald
when will the madness end, how can it when
there's no method the pad and pen
the only message that i have to send
is "dad, i'm back at it again."
bitch (who's your daddy?)


you fucking groupie, pick up the goddamn phone.

bitch, where the fuck were you tuesday? with who you say?
i wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'cha do screw dre?
you went there looking for me? boo that excuse is too lame
keep playin' me, you gon' end up with a huge goose egg
you fake lyin' slut you never told me you knew drake
and lupe? you wanna lose two legs?
you tryin' to flip this on me? if i spent more time with you, you say
ok, yeah and i'm coo-coo, ay?
well screw you and i'll be the third person who screwed you today
oh, fourth- dre, drake, lupe oohm touche
well you're too two-faced for me thought you was my number one true blue ace
but you ain't

'cause i'm hangin' up this phone, boo you make my fuckin' blue tooth ache
you feelin' blue, too late
go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurf and puke blue kool aid
here's what you say to someone you hate

my life would be so much better, if you'd just drop dead
i was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head
and i thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? i would feel so much better

think i just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
hop on the freeway, tryin' to get some time alone and just think
till the cops pulled me over but they let me go 'cause i told 'em i'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
i'm back on my fuck hoe's, with a whole new hatred for blondes
but bias? i hate all bitches the same, baby come on
excuse the pun but bitch is such a 'broad' statement and i'm
channelin' my anger through every single station that's on
'cause a woman broke my he-art i say he-art
'cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
who you think you a-are bitch?
guess it's time for me to get the dust off and pick myself up off the carpet
but i'll never say the l word again
i lo-lo-lo-lo lesbian
aaahhh i hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
my life'd be so much better if you just

my life would be so much better, if you'd just drop dead
i was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head
and i thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? i would feel so much better

'cause you told me you'd love me forever bitch that was a lie
now i never wanted someone to die so bad in my fuckin' life
but fuck it there's other fish in the sea

and i'm a have a whale of a time being a single sailor
for the night, bitch on a scale a
one to ten shit i must be the holy grail of
catches hoe i got an oscar attached to my fuckin' name (dayla)
i might hit the club find a chick that's tailor
made for me say fuck it kick some shots back git hammered and nail her
these bitches tryin' get attached but there failin' to latch onto the tail of
my bumper they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
like i'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah i'm rich as a bitch
but bitches ain't shit i'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
bitch you complain when you listen to this
but you still throw yourself at me that's what i call pitchin' a bitch
that's why i'm swingin' at these chicks on-site
long as i got a bat and two balls it's 'foul' but my dicks on 'strike'
so all that love shit is null and void, bitch i'm a droid
i avoid cupid stupid. wasn't for blow jobs you'd be unemployed
oye, yoy-yoy
man oh, man your boy-boy-boy's
gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink oink oink
you fuckin' pigs all you're good for is doink doink doink
i got ninety-nine problems and a bitch ain't one
she's all ninety-nine of 'em, i need a machine gun
i'll take 'em all out, i hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
have a heart attack and just
drop dead and i'm a throw a fuckin' party after this
'cause, yes...

my life would be so much better, if you'd just drop dead
i was layin' in bed last night thinkin' and this thought just popped in my head
and i thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? i would feel so much better

i'm just playin' bitch, you know i love you


yeah.

this is survival of the fittest

<i>[eminem:]</i>
wasn't ready to be no millionaire, i was ill-prepared
i was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
from the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
it was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fucking acronym
cut the fucking act like you're happy, i'm fucking back again
with another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
it ain't over 'til i say it's over â enough when i say enough
throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
i'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
when the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, i salivate at it
wait is up, hands up like it's twelve noon, nah, homie
hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
i ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt 'cause

<i>[liz rodrigues:]</i>
this is survival of the fittest
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all

i can see the finish line with each line that i finish
i'm so close to my goals i can almost pole vault over the goal post
and if i don't got enough in the tank, maybe i can just siphon enough
to fill up this last can, man will i survive in this climate or what?
they said i was washed up, and got a blood bath
i'm not a rapper, i'm an adapter, i can adjust
plus i can just walk up to a mic and just bust
so floor's open if you'd like to discuss
top five in this motherfucker and if i don't make the cut
what, like i give a fuck, i will light this bitch up like i'm driving a truck
to the side of a pump, zero to sixty hop in and gun it
like g-unit without the hyphen, i'm hyping 'em up
and if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
and i look like i might just give up, eh might've mistook
me for bowing out i ain't taking a bow, i'm stabbing myself
with a fucking knife in the gut, while i'm wiping my butt!
'cause i just shitted on the mic, and i like getting cut
i get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'cause i'mma fight 'til i die or win
biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
it's survival of what?

this is survival of the fittest
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all

<i>[eminem:]</i>
so get your ideas, stack your ammo
but don't come unless you come to battle,
now mount up, jump in the saddle
this is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
i don't do this music shit, i lose my shit
ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
it's all i know how to do, as soon as i get thrown in the booth, i spit
but my respect is overdue, i'm showing you the flow no one do
'cause i don't own no diploma for school, i quit!
so there's nothing for me to fall back on, i know no other trade
so you better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
'cause you'll never take my pride from me
it'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
but i want you to doubt me, i don't want you to believe
'cause this is something that i must use to succeed
and if you don't like me then fuck you!
self esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof 'cause trust me
my skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
i can see why the fuck i disgust you
i must be allergic to failure 'cause every time i come close to it
i just sneeze, but i just go achoo then achieve!

<i>[liz rodrigues:]</i>
this is survival of the fittest
this is do or die
this is the winner takes it all

tell me where to go, tell me what to do
i'll be right there for you
tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
i'll say it all for you

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
why am i so differently wired? am i a martian?
what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in?
'cause i don't belong in this world
that's why i'm scoffing at authority, defiant often
flying off at the handle at my mom, no dad
so i am non-compliant at home, at school i'm just shy and awkward
and i don't need no goddamn psychologist
tryna diagnose why i have all these underlying problems
thinking he can try and solve them
i'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
and in the front drive talking to myself
either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet
trying not to be noticed 'cause i'm crying and sobbing
i had a bad day at school so i ain't talking
some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
'cause he said that i eyeballed him

and if you fall, i'll get you there
i'll be your savior from all the wars that are fought
inside your world
please have faith in my words

'cause this is my legacy, legacy, eh
this is my legacy, legacy, eh
there's no guarantee,
it's not up to me,
we can only see
this is my legacy, legacy
legacy, legacy

<i>[verse two:]</i>
i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
why am i so differently wired in my noggin?
'cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'cause i obsess on everything in my mind small shit
bothers me but not my father, he said sayonara then split
but i don't give a shit i'm fine long as
there's batteries in my walkman nothing's the matter with me
shit look on the bright side at least i ain't walking
i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a ten speed which i've acquired parts that i
find in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it
headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
but if this is all there is for me life offers
why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
what about them rhymes i've been jottin'
they're kinda giving me confidence
instead of tryna escape through my comics,
why don't i just blast a little something like onyx
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what i wanna say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him
grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
who would've knew from the moment i turned the mic on that
i could be iconic, and my conquest
is word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest

this is my legacy, legacy, eh
this is my legacy, legacy, eh
there's no guarantee,
it's not up to me,
we can only see
this is my legacy, legacy
legacy, legacy

<i>[verse three:]</i>
i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
now i think the fact that i'm differently wired's awesome
'cause if i wasn't i wouldn't be able to work
words like this and connect lines like crosswords
and use my enemy's words as strength
to try and draw from, and get inspired off em
'cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit
by you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
now you shut up bitch, i am talking
thought i was full of horseshit and now
you fucking worship the ground in which i am walking
me against the world so what? i'm brian dawkins
versus the whole zero and sixteen lions offense
so bring on the giants falcons and miami dolphins
it's the body bag game bitch i'm supplying coffins
'cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of brian baldingers
you gon' die a ball licker i've been diabolical
with this dialogue since ninety-nine rawkus
you don't respect the legacy i leave behind y'all can
suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
in a flying saucer full of italian sausage
the most high exalting and i ain't halting
till i die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
the best part about me is i am not you
i'm me and i'm the fire marshall and this is my

legacy, legacy, eh
this is my legacy, legacy, eh
there's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
this is my legacy, legacy

<i>[verse one:]</i>
came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
an asshole, that role think i succeeded fulfillin'
but don't think i ever stopped to think that i was speaking to children
everything was happenin' so fast. it was like i blinked, sold three million
then it all went blank, all i remember is feelin' ridiculous 'cause i was getting sick of this feelin'
like i'm always under attack, man, i coulda stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
women dishin' but really
thinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him
guess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite when i'm rippin' shit. but since when did this many
people ever give a shit what i had to say? it's just my opinion
if it contradicts how i'm livin' put a dick in your rear-end
that's why every time you mention a lyric
i thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
'cause it gave me an enormous platform, i'm flattered you thought i was that important
but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it
mad awards, had glaad annoyed atta-boy
they told me to slow down, i'd just zone-out
good luck tryin' to convince a blonde, it's like telling gwen stefani that she sold out
'cause i was trying to leave no doubt
in anyone's mind one day i'd go down in history think they know now
because everybody knows

<i>[chorus - skylar grey:]</i>
everybody knows, that you're just an asshole
everywhere that you go, people want to go home, everyone knows
everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
there's no place you can hide, you are just an asshole
everyone knows, everyone knows
thanks for the support, asshole <i>[twox]</i>

<i>[verse two:]</i>
quit actin' salty, i was countin' on you to count me out
ask asher roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out
thought i was history, well god damn honky that compliment's like back-handin' a donkey, good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
nah, i'm off him, but what the fuck's all this trash talking about?
the fight was fixed, i'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down
i went down for the count, i fell but the fans caught me and now
you're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my belt
word to pacquiao, mama said there ain't nothing else to talk about
better go in that ring and knock 'em out, or you better not come out
it's poetry in motion like freddie roach when he's quotin'
shake-speare, so what if insults are revoltin'
even helen keller knows life stinks
you think it's a joke 'till your bullet riddled, but you should give little shit what i think
this whole world is a mess,
gotta have a goddamn vest
on your chest
and a glock just to go watch batman
who needs to test a testicles? not that man
half you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage, rest of you got lap bands
stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those
water bottles in colorado, so get lost, waldo my soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
a black hole and i'm swallowin' this track whole, better pack toilet paper
but i'm takin' no crap hoe, here i go down the bat pole and i'm changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go, tryin' to dip out the back door retreating
'cause everybody knows

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three:]</i>
holy mackerel. i'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth. i smacked a girl
off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
for thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
then screamed "icp in this bitch! how do fuckin' magnets work?"
'cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable,
hate to be dramatical but i'm not romantical
i'm makin' up words, so you can understandable
it's tragical, thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
you crackin' a joke? it's laughable
'cause me and love's like a bad combination i keep them feelings locked in a vault, so it's safe to say i'm uncrackable
my heart is truly guarded
full body armor bitch, you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you special, you're retarded
thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
you're a trainwreck, i got a one-track mind and, shorty, you're fine but you sorta remind me of a forty-nine'er
'cause you've been a gold digger since you was a miner
been tryin' to hunt me down like a dog 'cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
'cause all of my spare time's spent
on my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
only women that i love are my daughters, but sometimes i rhyme
and it sounds like i forget i'm a father and i push it farther, so, father, forgive me if i forget to draw the line
it's apparent i shouldn't have been parent i'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents and 'mother' fuck 'father' time
it ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
so even if i'm half-dead, i'm half alive
poured my half-empty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over
and i'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster
i'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah cocky and
can't knock bein' rudolph, so fear not my deer
and dry up your tear drops i'm here
white america's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
if you stare at me and see yourself, 'cause you're one too, shouldn't be a shock be
'cause everybody knows

<i>[chorus]</i>


now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
i'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
that's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-ag
just like i did with addiction i'm 'bout to kick it
like a magician, critics i turn to crickets

life's too short to not go for broke
so everybody, everybody (go berzerk), shake your body

guess it's just the way that i'm dressed, ain't it?
khaki's pressed, nike shoes crispy and fresh laced, so i guess it ain't
that aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
plus i showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
so if love is a chess game, check mate
but, girl, your body's banging, jump me in, dang, bang-bang
yes siree, 'bob', i was thinking the same thang
so come get on this kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
pow-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
got your gal blowing up a valve, valve-valve
ain't slowing it down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
dumb it down, i don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
least i know that i don't know
question is are you both so smart enough to feel stupid
hope so, now hoe...

kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(and go berzerk) all night long
grow your beard out, just weird out
(and go berzerk) all night long

we're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
so turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
so crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
say "fuck it!" before we kick the bucket

<i>[scratch]</i>

and they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
all i know is i fell asleep and woke up in that monte carlo
with the ugly kardashian
lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
but i done did enough codeine to knock future into tomorrow
and, girl, i ain't got no money to borrow
but i am trying to find a way to get you alone (car note)
oh, marshall mathers
shit head with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
kangols and car-heart-less cargos
girl, you're fixing to get your heart broke
don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain baby
i ain't called anybody baby since birdman, unless you're a swallow
word, rick, word, man, you heard, but don't get discouraged, girl

look, i was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
but i'm only going to get this one chance
(six minutes, six minutes)
something's wrong, i can feel it
(six minutes, six minutes, slim shady, you're on)
just a feeling i've got
like something's about to happen
but i don't know what
if that means, what i think it means, we're in trouble
big trouble. and if he is as bananas as you say
i'm not taking any chances
you are just what the doc ordered

i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
they said i rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot

but for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my pen'll go off when i half-cock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a living and a killing off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feeling on his nutsack
i'm an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
this flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop
you don't really wanna get into a pissing match
with this rappity brat
packing a mac in the back of the ac
backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
and at the exact same time
i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicing that
i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic
i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow? all i do is drop "f" bombs
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are having a rough time period
here's a maxi pad
it's actually disastrously bad
for the wack while i'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah

'cause i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

everybody want the key and the secret to rap
immortality like i have got
well, to be truthful the blueprint's
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew)
mcs get taken to school with this music
'cause i use it as a vehicle to 'bust a rhyme'
now i lead a new school full of students
me? i'm a product of rakim
lakim shabazz, twopac, n.w.a., cube, hey, doc, ren
yella, eazy, thank you, they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up
blow up and be in a position
to meet run-d.m.c. and induct them
into the motherfuckin' rock n'
roll hall of fame even though i walk in the church
and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of shame
you fags think it's all a game
'til i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and
tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
little gay-looking boy
so gay i can barely say it with a 'straight' face, looking boy
you're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
oy vey, that boy's gay
that's all they say, looking boy
you get a thumbs up, pat on the back
and a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
hey, looking boy, what d'you say, looking boy?
i get a "hell yeah" from dre, looking boy
i'mma work for everything i have
never asked nobody for shit
get outta my face, looking boy
basically boy you're never gonna be capable
of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause

i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
the way i'm racing around the track, call me nascar, nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park, the white trash god
kneel before general zod this planet's krypton, no asgard, asgard

so you'll be thor and i'll be odin
you're rodent, i'm omnipotent
let off then i'm reloading
immediately with these bombs i'm totin'
and i should not be woken
i'm the walking dead
but i'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
but i got your mom deep-throating
i'm out my ramen noodle
we have nothing in common, poodle
i'm a doberman, pinch yourself
in the arm and pay homage, pupil
it's me
my honesty's brutal
but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize
what i do though for good
at least once in a while so i wanna make sure
somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle
enough rhymes to
maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case 'cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground
but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes
but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come trying to
censor you like that one line i said
on "i'm back" from the mathers lp
one when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine
put 'em all in a line
add an ak-forty-seven, a revolver and a nine
see if i get away with it now
that i ain't as big as i was, but i'm
morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
you're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're pointless as rapunzel
with fucking cornrows
you write normal? fuck being normal
and i just bought a new ray gun from the future
just to come and shoot ya
like when fabolous made ray j mad
'cause fab said he looked like a fag
at mayweather's pad singin' to a man
while he played piano
man, oh man, that was a twenty-four/seven special
on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day
"hey, fab, i'mma kill you"
lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed, (jj fad)
uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming i'm a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you? i'm superhuman
innovative and i'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is
ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
never fading, and i know that haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off, they'll be celebrating
'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated
i make elevating music
you make elevator music
"oh, he's too mainstream."
well, that's what they do
when they get jealous, they confuse it
"it's not hip-hop, it's pop."
'cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock, shock rap with doc
throw on "lose yourself" and make 'em lose it
"i don't know how to make songs like that
i don't know what words to use."
let me know when it occurs to you
while i'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
it's curtains, i'm inadvertently hurtin' you
how many verses i gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice
your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
unghh, school flunky, pill junky
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself, but still hungry
i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to
when i'm a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues
but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
i'm drunk. so, satan, take the fucking wheel
i'm asleep in the front seat
bumping heavy d and the boyz
still "chunky, but funky"
but in my head there's something
i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and
here's what they want from me
they're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i had
then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it
life's handing you lemons
make lemonade then
but if i can't batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then?
don't mistake him for satan
it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas
and take a vacation to trip a broad
and make her fall on her face and
don't be a retard, be a king?
think not
why be a king when you can be a god?


eminem has a full line of chainsaws
eminem... eminem... eminem... eminem... eminem... eminem...
marshall mathers, eminem, the rapper... eminem
who can say for sure?
perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
if science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
society would reap a great benefit

i walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
who's likely to become a serial killer, case of tourettes
fuck fuck fuck can't take the stress
i make a mess, as the day progresses, angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
like this is how i'll cut your face up, bitches with these hedge trimmin' scissors with razor edges
imagination's dangerous it's
the only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation, i guess
'cause i feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
despicable i'm sick of just getting pushed it's ridiculous
i look like a freakin' wuss, a pussy this kid just took
my stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
i wanna kick his tush, but i was six and shook
this fucker was twelve and was six foot with a vicious hook
he hit me i fell, i got back up all i did was book, now there's using your head
mama always said...

if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous
i'mma prove you wrong
mama, i'mma grow one day to be famous and i'mma be a pain in the anus
i'mma be the bomb
i'mma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness
mama always said, "son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."

fast forward some years later a teenager, this is fun, sweet
i just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
it's usually once a month, this is some feat
i've accomplished they stomped me into the mud, gee for what reason? you stumped me
but how do you get the shit beat outta you, beat down and be upbeat, when you don't have nothing?
no valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
'cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on jump street from jump street
but if i could just get my head out my ass
i could accomplish any task
practicin' trash talkin'
in a trance locked in my room, yeah but i got some plans, mama
these damn rhymes are fallin' outta my pants pocket, i can't stop it
and i'm startin' to blend in more
in school this shit helps for sure, i'm gettin' more self-assured than i've ever been before
plus no one picks on me anymore, i done put a stop to that, threw my first punch- end of story
still in my skull's a vacant empty void been usin' it more as a bin for storage
take some inventory
in this gourde there's a ford engine, door hinge, syringe, an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword
not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
ironin' board a bench, a wrench, a ore, wench an attention whore
everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin' chain like an independent store
something's wrong with my head
just think if i had a brain in it, thank god that i don't, 'cause i'd probably be dahmer, 'cause mama always said...

if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous
i'mma prove you wrong
mama, i'mma grow one day to be famous and i'mma be a pain in the anus
i'mma be the bomb
i'mma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness
mama always said, "son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."

now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
'cause i'm not that smart, but i'm not dumb
i was on the bottom of the pile gettin' stomped
but somehow i came out on top
(oh-oh-oo-oh)

i told you one day, i said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
i'm nice ya'll, fuck it, i'm out cold
now everywhere i go they scream out go, i'm bout to clean house, yo
i'm lysol, now i'm just household
out sold the sell-outs, freak the hell out middle america, hear 'em yell out, in terror they were so scared and those kids
just about, belted out whatever spouted or fell out my smart aleck mouth it was so weird
inappropriate? so be it, i don't see it
maybe one day when the smoke clears it won't be as
motherfuckin', difficult yeah, 'til then hopefully ya
little homos get over your fears and phobias
it's ok to be scared-straight they said i provoked queers
'til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
a stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes, yeah
you motherfuckin' "insert insult here"
who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole' emcee'd
be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?
and boy, they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked
this hip-hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
that white-trash traffic in gridlock shit hoppin' like six blocks
from a kid rock insane clown posse concert in mid october
and god forbid i see the wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all cause
i'll turn into the unabomber mama always said...

if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous
i'mma prove you wrong
mama, i'mma grow one day to be famous and i'mma be a pain in the anus
i'mma be the bomb
i'mma use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaneness
mama always said, "son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless."

insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck
neither is ain't


you used to say that i'd never be nothing without you
and i believe
i'm shot in the lungs, i gasp, i can't breathe
just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
and i'd beg and i'd plead, drop to knees
and i'd cry and i'd scream, "baby, please don't leave!"
snatch the keys from your hand
i would squeeze and you'd laugh
and you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
and you must hate me
why do you date me if you say i make you sick?
and you've had enough of me
i smother you, i'm 'bout to jump off the edge

but you won't break me
you'll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you, i'll bet you i'll be just fine without you
and if i stumble, i won't crumble
i'll get back up and uhhh
and i'mma still be humble when i scream, "fuck you!"
'cause i'm stronger than i was

a beautiful face is all that you have
'cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
but you're all that i love
i grasp, you can't leave
please stay here with me, baby, hold me please

and i'd beg and i'd plead, drop to knees
and i'd cry and i'd scream, "baby, please don't leave!"
but you left and you took everything i had left
and left nothing, nothing for me
so please don't wake me from this dream, baby
we're still together in my head
and you're still in love with me
'til i woke up to discover that that dream was dead

but you won't break me
you'll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you, i'll bet you i'll be just fine without you
and if i stumble, i won't crumble
i'll get back up and uhhh
and i'mma still be humble when i scream, "fuck you!"
'cause i'm stronger than i was

you walked out, i almost died
it was almost a homicide that you caused 'cause i was so traumatized
felt like i was in for a long bus ride
i'd rather die than you not by my side
can't count how many times i vomited, cried
go to my room, turn the radio on and hide,
thought we were bonnie and clyde
no, on the inside you were jekyll and hyde i
felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
it was you and i, why did i think it was ride or die?
'cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
it's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
other side of my back and stuck a spike, too, should've
put up more of a fight, but i couldn't at the time
no one could hurt me like you could've
take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer
'cause this morning i finally stood up
held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
first time since you left and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
and the life we could've had and we could've been
but i'm breaking out of this slump i'm in
pulling myself out of the dumps once again
i'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
i'mma be late for the pity party
but you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chump-ions
i'm done being your punching bag

it was november thirty-onest today, would've been our anniversary
two years, but you left on the first of may
i wrote it on a calender, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say
but they came to me just now, so i put 'em in a verse to lay
and i thank you (uh) 'cause you made me (uh) a better person than i was
but i hate you (uh) 'cause you drained me (uh)
i gave you all, you gave me none
but if you blame me (uh), you're crazy (uh)
and after all is said and done
i'm still angry, yeah, i may be
i may never trust someone

but you won't break me
you'll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you, i'll bet you i'll be just fine without you
and if i stumble, i won't crumble
i'll get back up and uhhh
and i'mma still be humble when i scream, "fuck you!"
'cause i'm stronger than i was

you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy

i wanted the fame, but not the cover of newsweek
oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public. excuse me
for wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew; see, but it was confusing
'cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam (wooh!)
hit the lottery, oh wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winning a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm getting so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep

now, i ain't much of a poet but i know somebody once told me
to seize the moment and don't squander it
'cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
so i keep conjuring, sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.
no wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.)
yoda-loda-le-hee-hoo
i think it went wandering off down yonder
and stumbled on 'ta jeff vanvonderen
'cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
'cause the very thing that i love's killing me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conking me in the head
keep knocking, nobody's home, i'm sleepwalking
i'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
don't shoot the messenger, i'm just friends with the

call me crazy but i have this vision
one day that i'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and i'm coming straight at

take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that
pumped up feeling and shit to say back
to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fucking children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
it's payback, russell wilson falling way back

i own a mansion but live in a house
a king-size bed, but i sleep on the couch
i'm mister bright side, glass is half-full
but my tank's half empty, gasket just blew

this always happens
thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin, only option i have's mcdonald's' bathroom
in a public stall droppin' a football so every time someone walks in the john i get maddened
"shady, what up?" what? come on, man, i'm crappin'
and you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
oh, that's odd, i just happened
to run out of tissue, yeah, hand me that on second though i'd be glad then
"thanks dog. name's todd, a big fan" i
wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad threw it back and
told 'im, "todd, you're the shit." when's all of this crap end?
can't pump my gas without causin' an accident
pump my gas, cut my grass, i can't take out the fuckin' trash
without someone passin' through my sub harassin'
i'd count my blessings but i suck at math
i'd rather wallow than bask, suffering succotash, but the ant-
acid it gives my stomach gas
when i mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
potatoes, so what hoe kiss my country bumpkin ass
missouri southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?
call lunch dinner, call dinner supper, tupperware in the cupboard plastic ware up the ass
stuck in the past ipod what the fuck is that?
b-boy to the core, mule, i'm as stubborn as

maybe that's why i feel so strange
got it all, but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave detroit
it's the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i could never turn my back on a city that made me
and "life's been good to me so far"

they call me classless i heard that
i second and third that
don't know what the fuck i'd be doin' if it weren't rap
probably be a giant turd sack
but i blew, never turned back
turned forty and still sag
teenagers act more fuckin' mature jack
fuck you gonna say to me? i'll leave on my own terms ass
hole i'm going berserk, my nerves are bad
but i love the perks my work has
i get to meet famous people look at her, dag
her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged and i heard she drag races <i>[burp]</i> swag
tuck in my hanes shirt tag
you're danica patrick (yeah) word skag
we'd be the perfect match, 'cause you're a vacuum, i'm a dirtbag
my apologies
no disrespect to technology
but what the heck's all of these buttons?
you expect me to sit here and learn that?
fuck i gotta do to hear this new song from luda
be an expert at computers?
i'd rather be an encyclopedia britannica
hell with playstation, i'm still on my first man on some zelda
nintendo, bitch! run, jump, punch, stab, and i melt the
mozzarella on my spaghetti put it on bread make a sandwich with welch's
and belch, they say this spray butter's bad for my health,
but i think this poor white trash from the trailer
jed clampett, fred sanford and welfare, mentality helps to
keep me grounded, that's why i never take full advantage of wealth
i managed to dwell
within these parameters
still crammin' the shelves full of hamburger helper
i can't even help it, this is the hand i was dealt a
creature of habit, feel like i'm trapped in an animal shelter
with all these pet peeves, god damn it to hell
i can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
i can't go anywhere, i get so mad i could yell the
other day someone got all elaborate
and stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
went to burger king, they spit on my onion rings
i think my karma's catching up with me

maybe that's why i feel so strange
got it all, but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave detroit
it's the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i could never turn my back on a city that made me
and "life's been good to me so far"

got friends on facebook all over the world
not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
so, i'm artist of the decade, i even got a plaque
i'd hang it up but the frame is all cracked

i'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
in produce, hunched over, giant nose bleed
ogre style as i mosey over to the frozen aisle, by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
embarrassed, i just did comerica with hova the show's over, i'm hidin' in kroger's buyin' groceries
he just had front-row seats told me to sign his poster then insults me
"wow up close didn't know you had crow's feet!"
i'm at a crossroads, lost, still shopping at costco's
sloppy joe's, bulk waffles
got caught pickin' my nose (aaghh!) look over see these two hot hoes
finger still up one of my nostrils
right next to 'em, stuck at the light the fuckin' shit's
takin' forever to change, it's stuck these bitches are lovin' it
rubbin' it in, chucklin'
couldn't do nothin' play it off "what you bumpin'?"
"trunk muzik, yelawolf's better", fuckin' bitch
they want me to flip at the label, but i won't succumb to it
the pressure, they want me to follow up with a
nother one after recovery was so highly coveted
but what good is a fuckin' recovery if i fumble it?
'cause i'mma drop the ball if i don't get a grip, hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
wrong subdivision
to fuck with, bitch, quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
i love my city,
but you pushed me to the limit. what a pity
the shit i complain about
it's like there ain't a cloud in the sky, and it's rainin' out
kool-aid stain on the couch, i'll never get it out
but, bitch, i got an elevator in my house, ants and a mouse
i'm livin' the dream

maybe that's why i feel so strange
got it all, but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave detroit
it's the motivation that keeps me going
this is the inspiration i need
i could never turn my back on a city that made me

<i>[eminem:]</i>
something's burnin' i can't figure out what
(out what) it's either lust, or a cloud of dust, judgment is clouded must
just be the powder from the power of
(love) but i'm in somethin' i don't know how to get outta
left my girl in the house alone, is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan and the further i walk the louder
pause for a minute to make certain that's what i heard, 'cause after all this is her place
so i give her the benefit of the doubt i
think i might be about to busta, bust her, the thought's scary yo, though and it hurts-brace
hope it ain't "here we go, yo" 'cause my head already goes to worst-case scenario, though in the first place
but you confirmed my low end theory though, should've known when i made it all the way to third base
and that was only the first date, could've made it to home plate
but you slid straight for the dome and dove face
first "no <i>[slurp]</i>, you don't <i>[slurp]</i> underâ<i>[slurp]</i>âstand <i>[slurp]</i>. i <i>[slurp]</i> don't <i>[hic]</i> do <i>[slurp]</i> this for anyone ever."
yeah, that ain't what they all say
i'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
used to be my fiancã©e, 'til you sucked on wayne, andrã© and kanye,
lebron, akon, jay, lil' jon, raekwon, ma$e, polow tha don, dre
dante ross, james conway, kwame
guess i'm gettin' my g-god dang jigga on, eh?
'cause your name i'm beyond sayin'
but fuck it i'm movin' on, you women are all cray
but i'll probably always keep on playin'
the game of love, love, love, love, la-la-la-la-la love

she doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
she hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
i tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
she screamed she loved me, like she never did before
and i told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, i don't care
and i told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, i don't care
i told that bitch

i'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick

now have a blessed day..." bitch, you serious?
i'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as a caesarean
you know i want you bad as a benjamin, i'm delirious
i want you bad as the head shattered on george zimmerman
after the dillinger hit him diligently and killin' 'im
his mouth piece for a cadillac emblem
that's analogy and metaphor for you
i should win a medal for all the ways i adore you
this is me talkin' cordial, yeah i got some home trainin'
that ain't what you like, ain't it? what about if i was as famous
as marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool?
cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
singing, "i hope she's good enough
meanwhile you're chasing her."
chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her, pity the fool and pity the fool in me i'mma live with the
game of love, love, love, love, la-la-la-la-la love

she doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
she hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
i tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
she screamed she loved me, like she never did before
and i told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, i don't care
and i told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, i don't care
i told that bitch

<i>[eminem:]</i>
so needless to say, i'm feelin' betrayed, snatch my house key off her key chain
she jumps off 'wee-bey' from the wire's dick now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
here goes that broken record clichã©, it's all my fault anyway she's turnin' the tables, i'm a beat-break
she treats my face like serato, she cuts and scratches like a dj, each day is an instant replay
they say what we display, is symptomatic of attack behave
ior, back together, but forgot today was her b-day
she cut me off on the freeway
simple misunderstandin' but just as i went to slam on the brakes, that's when i realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
bitch cut my fuckin' brake line, stepped on them fuckers eight times, still goin' seventy-three thank
god there's an exit comin' up, what the mother f-u-c-k's
wrong with her, hit the off-ramp, 'til i coasted to a goddamn halt, hit a fucking tree now here she comes at full speed she's racing at me, ok, you wanna fuck with me 'eh?
snatch that bitch out her car through the window she's screamin' i body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave
and created a sink hole, buried the stink hoe in it, then paid to have the street repaved (the fuck?)
woke up in a dream state
in a cold sweat like i got hit with a freeze ray, durin' a heat wave
guess i eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed
directly aimin' a gat at my head
woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, i've had it i'm checkin' into rehab
i confess i'm a static addict i guess
that's why i'm so clingy every girl i've ever had either says
i got too much baggage or i'm too fuckin' dramatic, man what the fuck is the matter? i'm just
a fuckin' romantic, i fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch! combative, possessive, in fact last time i was mad at an ex
i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
i said, "hit the road," and after she left i sent that bitch a text
i said, "be careful driving. don't read this and have an accident!" she glanced to look at it and wrecked
too bad, thought we had a connect- no sense dwelling makes
never been a more compelling case, than the model covered in l'oreal and mace
who fell from grace eleven stories, for story telling, while the whore was yelling rape
'til her vocal chords were swelling and her voice was more horser than tori spellings' face
still they swarm the gates
of my fancy estates to greet norman bates with a warm embrace
'less you're andrea yates, don't ask me for a date
don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
but wait, think there's been a mistake
you wanted an intimate date, i wanna intimidate
i have infinite hate in my blood
it's mainly 'cause of the game of
<i>[phone ring]</i> wait, "dinner at eight?"
i have infinite hate in my blood
it's mainly 'cause of the game of love

love, love, love
la-la-la-la-la love


<i>[verse one: nate ruess]</i>
mom, i know i let you down
and though you say the days are happy
why is the power off, and i'm fucked up?
and, mom, i know he's not around
but don't you place the blame on me
as you pour yourself another drink, yeah.

<i>[hook: nate ruess]</i>
i guess we are who we are
headlights shining in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too far

<i>[verse two: eminem]</i>
i went in headfirst
never thinking about who what i said hurt, in what verse
my mom probably got it the worst
the brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
did i take it too far?
"cleaning out my closet" and all them other songs
but regardless i don't hate you 'cause, ma,
you're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
though far be it from you to be calm, our house was vietnam
desert storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
and forever we can drag this on and on
but, agree to disagree
that gift from me up under the christmas tree don't mean shit to me
you're kicking me out? it's fifteen degrees and it's christmas eve (little prick just leave)
ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
why we always at each other's throats?
especially when dad, he fucked us both
we're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
further away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
and i was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
then nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,
and that's when i realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
and to this day we remained estranged and i hate it though, but

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse three: eminem]</i>
'cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though
'cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
but i'm sorry, mama, for "cleaning out my closet", at the time i was angry
rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though,
'cause now i know it's not your fault, and i'm not making jokes
that song i no longer play at shows and i cringe every time it's on the radio
and i think of nathan being placed in a home
and all the medicine you fed us
and how i just wanted you to taste your own,
but now the medications taken over
and your mental state's deteriorating slow
and i'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
but, ma, i forgive you, so does nathan, yo
all you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
but i love you, debbie mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have,
'cause one thing i never asked was
where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
fuck it, i guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
but i'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
someone ever moved them from me? that you coulda bet your asses
if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa, kidnap them
and although one has only met their grandma once
you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
me, her and nate, we introduced you, hugged you
and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness come over me
as we pulled off to go our separate paths,
and i saw your headlights as i looked back
and i'm mad i didn't get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad
so, mom, please accept this as a tribute i wrote this on the jet
i guess i had to get this off my chest,
i hope i get the chance to lay it before i'm dead
the stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, i guess we're crashing
so if i'm not dreaming, i hope you get this message that i'll always love you from afar
'cause you're my ma

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse four: nate ruess]</i>
i want a new life (start over)
one without a cause (clean slate)
so i'm coming home tonight (yeah)
well, no matter what the cost
and if the plane goes down
or if the crew can't wake me up
well, just know that i'm alright
i was not afraid to die
oh, even if there's songs to sing
well, my children will carry me
just know that i'm alright
i was not afraid to die
because i put my faith in my little girls
so i never say, "goodbye, cruel world."
just know that i'm alright
i am not afraid to die

<i>[hook]</i>

i want a new life


yeah, trying to figure out the difference
but i think, i think the lines are starting to get blurry

i'm in a strange place
i feel like ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
i feel like i'm caged in these chains and restraints
grimming every stranger in the place while i gaze into space
'cause i'm mentally rearranging his face
i need a change of pace 'cause the pace i'm working at is dangerous
there's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
i done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
'cause that's where most of my anger is based
fuck your feelings, i feel like i play for the saints
i just wanna hurt you, aim for the skanks
then aim for all these fake kanye's, jay's, wayne's and the drake's
i'm frustrated 'cause ain't no more n'sync, now i'm all out of whack
i'm all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
i'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
i'm strapped for battle sucka-duck, crawl out the back, it's a bar fight
prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air
and bottles breaking, mirrors also
and i ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
you done called every woman a slut, but you're forgetting sarah, marshall (palin)
oh my bad, slut
and next time i show up to court i'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit
judge be like "that's sharp, how much did that motherfucker cost you?
smart ass, you're lucky i don't tear it off you
and jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
you're so fucking gravy, marshall, i should start calling you "au jus"
'cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo.
evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you."
i believe people can change, but only for the worse
i could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
so satanic k-mart chains panic
'cause they can't even spin back the curse words
'cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
(rape your mother, kill your parents)

shit, motherfucker, and these kids are like parrots
they run around the house just like terrorists
screaming "fuck, shit, fuck"
adult with a childish-like arrogance
wild ever since the day i came out i was like "merits, fuck that"
i'd rather be loud and i like swearing
from the first album even the gals were like "tight lyrics, dreamy eyes"
but my fucking mouth was nightmarish
and from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
and the opposition felt the opposite
sometimes i listen and revisit them old albums
often as i can and skim through all them bitches
to make sure i keep up with my competition
(ha ha) hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
borderline genius who's bored of his lines
and that sort of defines where i'm at and the way i feel now
feel like i might just strike first and ignore the replies

there's darkness closing in (evil twin)
there it goes again (my evil twin),
it controls my pen (my evil twin),
but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(then i step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)
but he's just a friend (evil twin),
who pops up now and again (again)
so don't blame me (evil twin)
blame him, it's my evil twin
(then i step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)

welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
you have slept for quite some time

so who's left? lady gaga? mess with the bieber?
nah, f with christina, i ain't fucking with either jessica neither
simpson or alba, my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
get the cloriseptic, excedrin, aleve or extra strength tylenol three's
feel like i'm burning to death, but i'm freezin'
bed-ridden and destined never to leave the
bedroom ever again like the legend of heath-uh- ledger
my suicide notes, barely legible read the
bottom, it's signed by the joker
lorena said i never can leave her
she'd sever my wiener i ever deceive her
fuck that shit, bitch
give up my dick for pussy, i'd be jerry mathers
i ever left it to beaver
get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
golly-wally, i vent, heat register, jesus
ever since one-nine-nine-four-six dresden it was definitely my destiny
when on the steps i met deshaun at osborn
i'd never make it to sophomore
i just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
flip burgers and wash dishes while i wrote rhymes tryna get props for 'em
'cause i took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
they were sleeping, i made 'em stop snorin'
made 'em break out the popcorn
now i've been hip-hop in its tip-top form
since n.w.a. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
screaming, "fuck the police!" like cop porn
flipped rap on its ear like i dropped corn
fuck top five, bitch, i'm top four
and that includes biggie and pac, whore
and i got an evil twin, so who the fuck do you think that threerd and that fourth spot's for?
and crazy as i am i'm much tamer than him
and i'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain eminem?
but no one's insaner than slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)
please come in, what was your name again?
hi, faggot
look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
and you're all aware i don't got it all upstairs
guess that's why i'm an addict and it's so small up there
peace to whitney, geez, just hit me
that i should call the looney police to come get me
'cause i'm so sick of being the truth i wish someone'd finally admit me
to a mental hospital with britney
oh, lmfao, no way, ho
jose baez couldn't beat this rap, oj no
hooray, i'm off the hook like casey anthony
hey ho, hey ho
i sound like i'm tryna sing the fucking chorus to "hip hop hooray"?
no, i'm hollering, you got bottom end like an eight-zero-eight
and i base whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so
let your low-end raise, yo
tango, what you think, ho?
slow dancing in the bowling
you tryna hold hands with your homie?
what? you think i'm looking for romance 'cause i'm lonely?
change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
hoe, i'm only vulnerable when i got a boner
superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt
don't try to fix me, i'm broke so i don't work
so are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work
but all bullshit aside i hit a stride
still shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
as it used to be when i first introduced y'all to my skittish side
and blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'cause we are the same, bitch


<i>[*baby crying*]</i>

one thousand different houses and mã¼nchhausen
i'mma make you wanna punch out some-fucking-one
"ouch!" what the fuck'd you hit me for?
scream "life" as i punch counter and bunches out of anger
i once encountered a stranger
in a dumb gown, black hood
with a scythe
shit i laughed in his face spit
bitch gave me an extra life, like "take this!"
now get your ass back in that game, bitch
don't take shit for granted
and don't take shit, give it!
only bull you should take is by the horns
a mixture of whitey ford and mighty thor
i everlast, pen is mightier than sword
finish writing then record
replenish, keep writing more
nothing's riding on it but your pride is all you're fighting for
so you fight, scratch, you claw
back's to wall
no one was there to catch you fall
you pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
you grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
pull out your pass for whooping ass and flash it on 'em
nobody's gonna back you in the corner
you're a hornet
no one's more ignorant
than you fuckin' four in the morning
you're at the laboratory, storming
like there's nothing that's more important
mc's you better consider this a formal warning
you're in for it
girl, what would you do if i said your body was off the chain
and i told you i smile every single time i saw your face?
i ain't finished, bitch
i meant in half, oil the blades
nobody wants to play
they say i'm a spoiled little baby
but

nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad
and gets to throwing a tantrum
he'll fucking flip on ya
'cause nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad
and gets to throwing a tantrum
he'll fucking flip on ya

what goes through an addict's brain?
besides static pain and big daddy kane
breakbeats and words
an erratic train of thought
like splatter paint
scatter-brained
yeah maybe that explains
why you're back but don't rap the same
and you're looking way thinner
'cause your hunger got you looking like
they took away dinner (chooka)
"sugar ray" leonard wouldn't sugar-coat a fucking booger though
just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
when you say you're a chooka what chooka what
now fling that bitch from your fingertips
hope it lands on another rap singer's lips
who can't think of shit
anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
who's king of this fucking english lit?
let your middle fingers flip on each hand
while extending this shit
how low can you go?
lower than chuck d ho
hear the bassiness in my voice?
rocky's back, where's my adrian?
nobody's crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
i'm what tom brady is to the patriots to rap
not a man, i'm a weapon
who just happened to be a rapper
who just happen to be on the crapper
when it happened i had an epiphany
in the bathroom, i'd never be the same after
now i'm back with an appe-tite
for destruction, the fucking recipe for disaster
so let's eat 'cause i'm famished
every deed is a dastardly one
evilish bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-lite
to people's like me havin' my teeth pulled

nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad
and gets to throwing a tantrum
he'll fucking flip on ya
'cause nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad
and gets to throwing a tantrum
he'll fucking flip on ya

so step inside a dimension
the demented side of a mind
that's like an inside of an engine
while i multiply your undivided attention
but be reminded: if i didn't mention
i lose my mind and my temper
you'll be the first one
who finds him offensive
got him climbing the fences
lost some time to addiction
but look up rhyme in the dictionary
i'm in the picture
eminem is the synonym for it
i'm an enigma
fuck it, let's get to the meat balls
i'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
edumacator they are
shit legends are made of
spit treacherous data
shit that you would say to your worst enemy
this wretched is
what you get when you mix treach with a jada
then combine 'em with method man and redman
with methamphetamines in his left hand
and in his right there's a sledge-hammer
in pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
beating himself in the head, 'til russell let's him off def jam
maybe i need my head examined
hannibal lecter with a dead lamb
hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
i need meds!
swear to god 'cause if i go off the edge
t.i. ain't talking me off a ledge man
heart throb at a fart, ah nah
more like a smart slob, part blob
that'll stab you with a sharp object
to the heart and leave claw marks
all over the wal-mart walls
little baby with large balls
fuck mud slinging, i'm blood flinging
there's nothing on this fucking earth better than being
the king of the playground
i hate the swings but i love being an underdog
'cause when i'm pushed
i end up swinging up

nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad
and gets to throwing a tantrum
he'll fucking flip on ya
'cause nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad
and gets to throwing a tantrum
he'll fucking flip on ya


<i>[verse one:]</i>
girl, you give me writer's block
i'm at a loss for words, uhh
my mind's as lost as yours
i rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
never seen no ass as large as yours
how much that cost? that's what i call the cost to splurge
you drive me bonkers, iâm about to get my swerve on for sure
thought i was pimpin' 'til i felt like nas, the first
date cause i think i gave you power, when i gave you flowers in a vase
a box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and certs
probably should've never let me call that job of yours
to talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
should've been one of the first signs to cause alert
man we jumped in too fast, cause since then i just can't be apart from her
cause nobody's body's awesomer, i lust it and she loves me
cause i'm popular, but you know this ain't love

<i>[hook - jamie n commons:]</i>
you know this ain't love, you know this ain't love
you know this ain't love, you know this ain't love (what is it then?)
it's desperation (she's looking for mr. right, wants me to be that guy to her)
it's desperation (i can't even put up a fight, cause i give in at the sight of her)
(and i here i go again)

<i>[verse two:]</i>
you were obviously oblivious to me, i swore i was just invisible to you
till i went to the lengths i did to meet you
cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
now i'm in disbelief i, never knew that this could be such misery, ah
cause now you see nothing but me, and i don't see nothing but you
and i'm about to flip cause we are super glued in
we stuck to each other's hips and we can't
do anything individually, which is to cling on, scared to be alone
can't, specifically describe it i just can't seem to give a reason
this definitive, just need you, talking bout i live and breathe you
and you pretend to be as mentally and physically
addicted to me as wiz khalifa is to reefer
don't wanna be without you
don't wanna be with you neither, bitch
put me in a situation in which it's both i wish to seek
cause this ain't love

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse three:]</i>
just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else
"what the fuck you whispering for?
you get on my nerves, you make me sick
i think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
i mean it's time that we just split and leave the
games behind your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
i think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too"
get the picture
that's a negative, alicia, i will never give the keys up
to the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from tiffany's
you better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? the lease up
i'm just mad the time it took to discover
you were using me for loot like i used you for looks
oh, thought you was too good for me, huh? yeah
toots, used to be my carrie underwood, i was your lumberjack
but i can't stomach this, i'm leaving you, i'm not coming back
she said, "the fuck with that, where's my louisville slugger at?"
she grabbed that fucking bat and swung it at my head
i barely ducked and that's right
when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice, steel toe
girl probably coulda put a one hundred-yard field goal through the uprights

<i>[hook]</i>


what is a nightmare? the dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare

i used to think i had bad luck, but i wasn't superstitious
'til one day i grew suspicious, when i stepped on a crack on aunt edna's stoop
and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
then we flew the coop to michigan to start a new be-ditching
missouri for michigan didn't work
so we moved back to missouri from michigan, from missouri back to michigan
someone put me out my misery, i can't do this again
mom please stick to a decision
discipline, last thing i wanna do is listen she's like
lex luthor, bitch, her rules are kryptonite
so the walls and i done lost my power to see through them bitches
but i run into them, running through the kitchen
pretending to be blind superman
'cause i had no supervision
but i did have a super power though
i could turn into invisible kid
disappear out of sight, like a true magician
and one day uncle ronnie brought over this new, but different
music into the picture and it became my new religion
"i remember it clearly, even today."
move back to michigan again, to live with my grandma nan
always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
through the radio stations one day
and discovered this dj who was mixing
i say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the wizard
you ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
i'd zone out with my headphones, all i remember doing's wishing
for shoes, fuck them stupid pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition troops
you get the new ll cool j cooling system
made that final maneuver to eight mile and hoover and somehow i saw my future is in this
that's how i knew my mission
little boom box boomin', spitting
practicing numerous rhythms
when i sit in my room envisioning
my dreams come to fruition
i remember proof would visit
couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go cuckoo ballistic
go through the roof for his shit
it's like we knew the instant
we touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit
never quit, too persistent
"we are the underground empire."

started a group of misfits
proof had a proposition
if we all band together, there ain't no stopping this shit
come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
be ready to come off the top as sharp position
if you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'
they'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
and you forgot your written
opportunity knocks once, it ain't knocking again
they tried ding-dong ditching shit
i fucking got that bitch in a headlock
cut off his oxygen slim snot gourgin
cock sucking cynder block in the wind
now i got my pot to piss in
spot in that top position
copping over the opposition
looking like a dog that's pissing
leg up on the competition
promising complete dominance, sugar ray robinson
i'm in a league muhammad's in
ali's my colleague bombing them
probably end up on top of them
stomping them like ndamukong
i'm russian like a ukrainian, ladainian tomlinson
flow vomits in your face
competitors fall at my waist
you spit a rhyme, i spit in a rhyme's face
so name the time, place to battle
bitch i'm still in that mind state
don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
cry babies, maybe my way that i use words is loose
but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
and the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
now where's your poop birds?
ooh, no more tripping in bird shit, songs of self-empowerment surging
words of encouragement but this discouraging the rappers
the rap game's god, but the name's not james todd, i'm just a wordsmith
so let these words lift
'cause all i got is bars for you dumbbells since yours ain't working out
each verse is more merciless than the first is
and you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served
blood thirst, revenge of the nerds
chickit

"and it's true that you'll not escape my vengeance."

and i'm the kid with them ears like dumbo's gone
word to uncle ron
i'm turning into a non-humble don
you blonde dumb hoes, all i got is dick for you to come blow on
so start the show, but i need a drum roll 'fore i go on
better back away from the front row, get launched
show you i'm bigger than dikembe mutumbo
on the fuckin' jumbotron
i'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaat
i'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yawn
so mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
and i'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
the goat just ate eight acres,
an eighth of that was just to make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
oh look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
charred debris floating
like oak wood was burning
return of the no good
and i won't quit

"and the next thing i know something came crawling up from below
something that made godzilla look like a plane."

and i don't quit, won't change,
it's like a groundhog's day
so crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may
see if i popped your head

"i'm a heartless monster"
turn me into
"i'm a heartless monster"
"with my dick in your mouth all day"

i'm not so sure i want to know from whence it came
but the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
there, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing


<i>[eminem and sia:]</i>
i can feel the heat rising, everything is on fire
today is a painful reminder of why
we can only get brighter
the further you put it behind ya
but right now i'm on the inside
lookin' out, 'cause

<i>[sia:]</i>
i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

<i>[eminem:]</i>
yesterday was the tornado warning
today's like the morning after
your world is torn in half
you wake in its wake to start the mourning process
and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
today's a whole new chapter
it's like an enormous asthma
thunderstorm has passed ya
you weathered it and poked its eye out
with the thorn bush that you
used to smell the roses
stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is, stuffed
so focused on the bright side
then you floor the gas pedal
and hit the corner fast the more asserted
never looking back
may hit the curb
but every day is a new learning curve as you
steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve
but you have to
to avert a disaster
lucky no permanent damage
'cause they hurt you so bad
it's like they murdered your ass
and threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
and that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
and while you're burning the past, standing in the inferno and chant

<i>[sia:]</i>
i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

<i>[eminem:]</i>
you're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
and it's as though you feel you've died
'cause you've been killed inside
but yet you're still alive
which means you will survive
although today you may weep 'cause you're weakened
and everything seems so bleak and hopeless
the light that you're seekin'
it begins to seep in
that's the only thing keepin'
you from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end
and i'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
and with a little time that should do the healing
and by tomorrow
you may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em even after
all the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building
and the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
you're sealed in but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
and as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin' you look down
'cause you're so over 'em
you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

as time passes
things change every day
but wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remain the same
but tomorrow today's going down in flames
throw the match, set the past ablaze

so feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire
from the heat
exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
and as you say goodbye to the grief
it's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
but you've extinguished this living hell
still a little piece of you dies as you scream

<i>[sia:]</i>
i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

i feel the burn, watch the smoke as i turn
rising, a phoenix from the flames
i have learned, from fighting fights, that weren't mine
not with fists, but with wings that i will fly

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light

i'm standin' in the flames
it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin' fire to yesterday
find the light, find the light, find the light


<i>[hook - x ambassadors:]</i>
i'm getting by with my wicked ways
i'm loading up and i'm taking names
i wanna dig my way to hell
i wanna dig my way to hell

<i>[verse one - eminem:]</i>
guess i got a way with words, i could get away with murder
ever heard of aspergers'? it's a rare condition
it's what you're suffering from
when you simply don't care if it's an
eighty degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
and you can't see the bitchâs hair is frizzing
cause you got the windows up
blaring the system in your chevrolet prizm
the devil ain't on a level same as him
picture someone who revels in straight masochism
and imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping
so bad they should put his ass in prison
a word bully, i verbally abuse verbs
like they did something to me personally
used to get bullied, so i'd cut class and ditch it
now i bully rap, i'm the shit, faggot (sniff it)
cadillac from a k car
my ass from a hole in the ground, still canât tell em a-part
came straight out the trailer park screaming i'm proud
to shop at k-mart and it became art
and i'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
to this day i, still get in fights with the same broad
at the same walmart arguing over the same cart
in the middle of the aisle whilin'
i don't give a fuck i don't play!
bitch you think you saw this basket first?
you're ass backwards like motherfucking bob and silent jay
illest shit you could think i would say
mind's like a pile of clay
when's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
ripped a gaping hole in it
flipped out, ripped down the drapes
tied 'em around my neck
went down the fire escape of the empire state
slipped, fell straight down to the ground
splattered all over the entire state
and straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
saw satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
while i sashayed around flames with a match and i gave him the gas face
and this ain't got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot
but by the way, thoughts are getting darker by the day
i'm a combination of skylar grey, tyler the creator, and violent j
it's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face i'm insane
every rhyme i say, sons you like an ultra violet ray
iâm selling hatred buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$eleven.ninety-nine so come on and pile a plate
iâm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell i can raise
with the rhyme iâm spittin' while iâm shittin' on competition
in the meantime itâs always mean time

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse two - eminem:]</i>
iâve been a career asshole
i donât see why these people always got my back
i done said so much fucked up shit, i was born a mistake
but i was put here not by accident
i had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
slaughter tracks, i done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
iâm coming to get that quarter back
like ndamukong, the drama can build
your mama can ask me for my autograph
cause that cougar's a milf, she's the oldest trick in the book
but i sure would fall for that
you done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
when i get on the mic i'mma snap
make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
when i overdosed woulda caught a flat
if it makes you sick to your stomach acid
indigestion, my suggestionâs kaopectate
if it feels like i'm running away with the game
it's cause i am, don't speculate, spectate
all i got is dick for days and insults for decades
but i get by with my wicked ways
lady you can suck a dick til your neck aches
cry til you get puffy eyes, red faced
but i'm leaving on this jet plane
you ain't fly, you're an airhead
and i'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
but your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage overhead space
cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase
cause baby, stable mentally i ain't
i need my meds, i peed my bed
i'm going blind, i don't see my legs
i keep on falling down, no wonder you can't stand me, i need my cane
someone help me, i think my face is melting
if you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
this g-i-a-n-t hole in my empty head
if you read my mind, you can see my pain
and you'd see why i be this way
ever since i was knee high playin' with g.i. joes
told these hoes shut their p-i-e holes, now peep my game
cause i'm 'bout it 'bout it
like a (like a) fucking (fucking)
echo (echo)... (psych) psycho on a cyclone cycle
spiraling, here i go, i`m outta control like no
other mic go, stab you til' the knife goes - dull
i'm nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
coz i'mma sock it to you
dyke ho, you don't like it
get on your harley davidson menstrual cycle
and ride it like a motorbike
i'm finna blow the mic the whole night so
strike up the fucking maestro, i'm nitro
and hi ho, hand me my shovel, i'm liable to dig my hole
deeper, and it's off to h.e double hockey sticks i go

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[outro - eminem &amp; ken kaniff:]</i>
ohh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
thank you, god
<i>[bathroom door opening, someone walks in]</i>
shit...
<i>[sounds of pissing and crapping]</i>
is that a girl?
<i>[ken kaniff singing:]</i>
i'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
and get my balls blew out, and get gay into the a.m
and lay with eighteen guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
- why do i know that voice?
buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
life's too short to not stroke your bone
- are you fucking serious?
so everybody, everybody
circle jerk, touch my body
<i>[doors slam, screaming]</i>
who is that? where are you going? come back
why does everyone always leave me?
hello? fuck you then
<i>[loud crapping noise]</i>
blow it out your ass


<i>[verse one]</i>
used to get, bent, now i represent to the fullest
pencil is full of insolent bullets
i'm like a doberman pinscher, pitbull and a rott'
mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
i begin to spitting like vintage pac, demented
demonic sinister, ever since the the doc replenished me
the day he gave me that shot when i was just 'bout to quit
so to not see him with me would be a shocking image
and i'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
and knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics
know that if i get off to a rocky start, i'll always have a rocky finish
eat me brocoli, spinach, cocky? nope
but i hope i offended you when i told ya how dope i am at this
and put emphasis on the "dope," so when names come up
in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
and don't mind me, while i remind you of the flow
you won't find anywhere, where it fires and i unload my pen explodes
'til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
let insults fly even sixty seconds that go by, so you know i meant it
in school i was so shy, timid
two pairs of jean's i'd alternate, bummy clothes, i 'member
begging my mom for k-mart macgregors cause they were new
st. vincent de paul, those pony's were used, and no size fitted
but kissed them old days, adios, i did it
they said i was a gimmick, now i'm the one that those guys mimic
now you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument
cause you know i'll win it, name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front

<i>[hook: buckshot]</i>
don't front, you know i got you open, kid

<i>[verse two]</i>
rest in piece to big proof, you was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me
i love you, doody, without you i feel so incomplete
i'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
i'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
better watch the fucking tone that you speak, feel like i'm in the zone
i'm in a whole different league on my mothafuckin' own, it's just me
no opponents can compete, and i've never been known to retreat
from beef, beep-beep, follow trends or wallow in defeat
i'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say bon appetit
cause i don't know what to eat, fucking microphone or the beat
bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
it's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
cause i rhyme like i'm still trying to get signed, up in the ebony show-
-case with denaun screaming "who the fuck passed you the mic?"
never asked you like my shit from the get
i'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
you had you a nice run, now take a hike
i ever meet my match, i'mma strike that bitch first
cause on the mic i gotta represent the real rappers
the real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills cracking
word to buckshot and dru-ha, why the fuck not?
you don't like it? suck a cock! almost forgot
before i signed with the doc, i almost signed with duck down
cause rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck loud
they jerked me around so what's up now?
wow, how much of an asshole would i sound like
rubbing it and holding some grudge now, but don't front

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse three]</i>
late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
now i write the type of shit to make you wipe
but wear diapers cause you might leave a streak
i'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
it's hard to decipher what cypher i might jump into tonight
cause i'm hyper or something, needing someone or something is lighting
this fire under me, it's breathing new life, it's like i already died once
i guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
my days of being broke was so long ago, i lost my concept of money
but you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me
oh shit, i'm down on one knee
i'm having a stroke of genius, elizabeth i'm coming to you, honey
from boy to man, it's still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland
i'm in another category, man, don't put me up with them pop stars
i never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
no offense? yes offense, precedents has been set that'll never get met
middle finger pressed against moby's nose
shouts to obie, the curtains closed on my show
(but never forget that i'm the one you thought wouldn't make it)
you can't take it, oh
got a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow
but convince me you've heard
an mc since me who's this good with the fucking mincing of words
without mincing words that'll make you feel like i'm pinching a nerve
whose mentally disturbed, you might as well stick a knife in me and turn
it'll be like my skin being indian burned
hah, bitch there isn't one, when will you learn?
never been served if memory serves
i'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words

<i>[outro: buckshot]</i>
you know i got you open kid, stop fronting
you know i got you open, word life


i'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
i disgust you like dialogue from the shop to the wired frog
night club, shit, i was taught if your cd's on fire
you had to put it out yourself like highland park, no fire department
so you might not hear sirens at all
but don't be alarmed if i sound off
something just ain't right with me, dawg
a martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder?
widely regarded highly, bite me, sweetheart, i'm slightly retarded
but tonight i'm starting shit, i'm feeling self righteous
i might just hop in a mosh pit on some mike tyson and pac shit
looking to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
i'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
fan of the lox, bananas, manic, i'm going in shock
frantic, i'm trapped in a closet
panic attack cause i'm claustrophobic
no, faggot, i mean i can't maneuver from movement
cause i have no room for improvement
i'm practically squashed, unpacked it and boxed it
toxic, hands are arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content
bar exam, start of insanity
charles hamilton slash manson and bronson
animal snarls, cannibal jaws
shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter
looking scamp as hannibal stalking
anthony hopkins with his hands in his pockets
black out, zach galifianakis, gallons of vodka
but that gal has some knockers
i bet you they ring a bell when i come back and i'm conscious
what happened, doc? i passed out again
alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
stole a magnum box and bag cirocs in back of a datsun
fell asleep watching fear factor and scare tactics
too close to the stairmaster
poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
no underwear, grasping a bayer aspirin and dropped it
air max in my closet, preposterous nikes made out of ostrich
and the cross stitching is a cross mixing
of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
fin dockers, oshkoshes, drop crotches
swatch watches and sneakers matches with the parkers
but it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
with all these trainers, but i don't have any boxers
and i'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
yo, why does it always sound like i'm grabbing my nostrils?
fuck that, i'll battle 'em all, i'll battle a mall
iâll stand there and yell that at a wall
until the mannequin doll scatter and the inanimate objects
that i'm battering all shatter and fall
cause i hear the track and i'm starting to get fucking amped
i'mma spark plug, i'm like the car with the cables hooked up to my fucking back, i'm a duracell
but i sure as hell got it backwards cause y'all could get jumped
and i'd catch the battery charge, but
i got a hunch like your back when it's arching
when i start attacking your squadron
you'll feel like mastercard when i'm charging
so take a swipe at me, i'm coming straight at you
like clay matthews from the green bay packers
so get the sack of wisconsin
that's nutbag that i'm talking, who am i kidding?
you faggots are all gonna do my bidding
don't get dragged to the auction
neiman marcus, bags of vuitton and all
i'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
see how mad you act when i drop you off at saks fifth ave
in a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
affable guy next door is laughable
my next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
that'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
no emotion hence i guess this sick prick dies hard
i got a magic johnson
it's like a magic wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
if ronda rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
holding a thousand magnums at once to pounce me
i'll laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
and all i see is paulie malign now, she's slaughterhouse in a blouse
and madonna with mud on her, god dammit i am misogynist
i slap linda ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
just so happens she's fond of algae
cause now she's faceplants on the concrete
complete lack of responsibility
half you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
but i let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
klepto, i'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
five-finger discount
been rapping so long i've been killing this shit, it's easy
kidnapping your mom cause i'm still in this bitch, thievery
ransom for jonbenã©t ramsey, chandra levy, and gary condit
("em") paul was scared that if i went back to the blonde
i might relapse, get on some bullshit
perhaps i'll launch some cracker taunts at action bronson
macklemore, mac miller and asher roth
and have some back and forths
and record a wack response to kendrick lamar's "control" verse
and perform "fack" in concert
<i>["fack" plays]</i>
yo, i put that shit on a greatest hits album
now that was awesome
it takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
sometimes i have to ponder why people are like
(i'll stick around)
and put up with my crap so long for
what's the attraction, mama?
is it the fact that i'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
who knows at this point, it's always poking so meh
still get along with this voice cause that's the monster
so do-si-do with a sociopath, everyone who knows me knows that
what they don't know is the fact rihanna calls me pinocchio, meh
she loves the way i lie
sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
pathological liar, oh, why am i such an asshole
that my disguise is pants, but they on fire
so am i-a, wooh, cappadonna, cut the track off (fart sound)
sabotage christmas, crap in your stocking
i'm wrapping up all the presents
in fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
jack santa claus, snap rudolph's antlers off
wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
blowing the head gasket at bed, bath and beyond
put the basket back while the bath salt packets are gone, i
know you really tired of me sampling billy squier
but classic rock acid rap is the genre
got slash on guitar, splashing bizarre, thrasher and aerosmith
and i'm a spectacular archer, feed count dracula chocula
godzilla, half dragon and bob dylan
bandwagoners, i'm kicking the damn stragglers off and i'm strangling 'em
smack kim basinger on a ass....


<i>[eminem:]</i>
i roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
this bed's empty without you
you said you're moving on
but i'm having some trouble getting there
but dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
fuckin' valentine's day
fuck february, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
machete on the floor, i smashed up every mirror
yeah, how do i look?
you fuckin' just left me here to die didn't you?
why didn't you respond yet?
i've written you five or six different times and
i'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
i didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
this couldn't be true, we can't be over
so violets are blue, roses are red
why is it everything i do i'm reminded of you?

<i>[chorus - kobe:]</i>
saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
saw my old sweetheart she said, "honey, i'm back"
just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

<i>[eminem:]</i>
guess i gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
now every woman that i look at i'm lookin' for you
so i'm findin' something the matter with them
excuse to not see anyone
useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
i get bold like bowling balls
grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what i want to say
damnit i'm drawin' blanks like i'm playin' hangman
i'm sick of playin' these games, i can't handle this heartbreak
it's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
like birthday cake candles
hang up the phone and i shake, i think i may have made a mistake
can't escape the madness
turn the radio on, i hate this sad song
but i can't even change the station
the same one's playin' on eight channels
i lay awake in shambles, i'm startin to hallucinate
i'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
in caskets and suddenly i wake and that's when i know i

<i>[chorus - kobe:]</i>
saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
saw my old sweetheart she said, "honey, i'm back"
just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

give me one more, bottle for the pain
give me one more for the memories
give me one more, i'll make it taste like a steak
it'll help alleviate
it'll soothe this ache
of trying to fake
that she's really, she's really coming back

<i>[eminem:]</i>
and it's been a while now, but i finally realize how
much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
i'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of it
and it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
and how i'll never hold you again
and there ain't shit i can do about it
now my head is overcrowded
with these clouded memories and i can't seem to get you out it
and how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
knowing what you done did to me, huh?
did it even occur to you that i loved you?
completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you
was you and me, once used to be together forever
it was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
we was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
when i sleep i wake up dead, must be why i

<i>[chorus - kobe:]</i>
saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
saw my old sweetheart she said, "honey, i'm back"
just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone


<i>[eminem:]</i>
feels like a close, it's coming to
fuck am i gonna do?
it's too late to start over
this is the only thing i, thing i know

<i>[eminem:]</i>
sometimes i feel like all i ever do is
find different ways to word the same, old song
ever since i came along
from the day the song called "hi, my name is" dropped

started thinkin' my name was fault
'cause any time things went wrong
i was the one who they would blame it on
the media made me the equivalent of a modern-day genghis khan
tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog

gangster? nah, courageous balls
had to change my style, they said i'm way too soft
and i sound like az and nas, out came the claws
and the fangs been out since then
but up until the instant that i went against it
it was ingrained in me that i wouldn't amount to a shit stain i thought
no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught

"do i really belong in this game?" i pondered
i just wanna play my part, should i make waves or not?
so back and forth in my brain, the tug-o-war wages on
and i don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form i was raised upon
but sometimes you gotta take a loss
and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off

you keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
and your only outfit so you know they're gonna talk about it
better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah

feel like i've already said this a kabillion eighty times
how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
what i really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
bet you feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are
when i was afraid to

<i>[sia:]</i>
i was a... afraid to make a single sound
afraid i would never find a way out
afraid i'd never be found (my dream)
i don't wanna go another round (but i won't)

an angry man's power will shut you up
trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
run out of excuses for everyone
so here i am and i will not run

guts over fear (the time is near)
guts over fear (might shed a tear)
for all the times i let you push me round
i let you keep me down
now i got guts over fear, guts over fear

<i>[eminem:]</i>
feels like a close, it's coming to
fuck am i gonna do?
it's too late to start over
this is the only thing i, thing i know

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i know what it was like, i was there once, single parents
hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
and the pain spawns all the anger on

but it wasn't 'til i put the pain in song learned who to aim it on
that i made a spark, started to spit harder
shit-learned how to harness it while the reins were off

and there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
was soon as i stopped saying "i gave a fuck"
haters started to appreciate my art

and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain i caused
but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone?
and the lights go out in that trailer park?

and the window is closing and there's nowhere else that i can go with flows
and i'm frozen 'cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun

so to the break of dawn
here i go recycling the same old song
but i'd rather make "not afraid two"
than make another motherfucking "we made you", uh

and i don't wanna seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs
my demise and my uprise, pray to god
i just opened enough eyes later on
gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make you strong
enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt

'cause i can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
just havin' to balance my dang self
when on eggshells i was made to walk
but thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
strength to cause shady-mania
so when they empty that stadium
'least i made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done

so this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
i represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that i made this song
and everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
from this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
take it with a grain of salt and eat their fuckin' faces off

the legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when i'm gone
and to think i was a

<i>[sia:]</i>
i was a... afraid to make a single sound
afraid i would never find a way o-o-out
afraid i'd never be found (my dream)
i don't wanna go another round (but i won't)

an angry man's power will shut you up
trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
run out of excuses for everyone
so here i am and i will not run

guts over fear (the time is near)
guts over fear (might shed a tear)
for all the times i let you push me round
i let you keep me down
now i got, guts over fear, guts over fear


another day, another hotel, the inside of it's nice though
oh well, this is my life so
as i go and try to close for the night's show
see how far that line goes
still blows my mind show
business guess i'll just never get
so this shit just always feels so weird
to this day because all i ever did
was just say the shit i wouldve wanted to hear
other people say to me when i was a kid
so please don't make me some type of hero
cause i will say some inspirational shit in a real way
but still will have a field day with some of the
fucked up shit in the world and tell it to suck the dick
cause i still make fun of a sit.
someone's in like a son of a bitch
at another's expense, i'm fuckin' relentless
as fuck when it comes to this pen
i struggle with coming to my senses
stuck on the fence on a balance beam if i seem unbalanced
it's challenging but my conscience allows me to think
the most foulish childish things without even blinking
without even thinkin' about, all the stinkin' amounts of people that seem to be reachin' in the crowds
i'm scream in the palace, sold out this evening
but now it's, lay me down to sleeping
is it really my soul to keep or
have i sold it cheap is it greed
do i take more than i need
when i joke about leavin'
but keep over achievin'
because what's stolen from me barely broke even

it's a fine, fine line
it's a fine, fine line

so i notice how i paint myself
and through my hair when ordeals i'm so vain
i want my respect but ignore the
butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
till i, sit in the dark and i reflect
and my reflection shows what it's like here
cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights yeah
it's like a nightmare
i said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
and i don't like how i see myself so i
open the bible to isaiah cause
i swear to christ there are nights where
i stay up at night just to say a prayer twice
just to make sure god hears cause this ice layer
ice skate on the nice way
puting it but i like staying
feistier then a triceritops and like a dice player
i got a nice pair of dice here
sealed off in my lair
away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
from in this house it's quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it
and i feel so isolated, nice i made it
but it's like i payed the price of fame twice i hate it
so i bitch about my life then make another song, it's a cycle ain't it
then i wonder why i stay famous
keep walkin' the line
this gold fish poke gets old
but especially when you don't know
if your conscience is sayin' i told you so
you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
or if you sold your soul

it's a fine, fine line
it's a fine, fine line

and from here you look so small
hovering high above us all
please come back, to me

i still remember the times when
they were, simpler than the rhymes of
vanilla ice were, when i was just killin' the mics
i'll never forget what that feeling was like i,
miss those times now when i was just starting out
without a dime and, now i'm diamond
can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when i've been
stuck in this house hibernatin'
hate even going outside it
sucks, sometimes i just wanna walk in target and look at shit browse, i don't even want to buy nothin'
i just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
look how excited, i sound when i get to talkin' bout life and
everything about it i miss
which now reminds me
put a thousand lighters in the sky for the outsidaz
wow, i must have had alzheimers
long time since i shouted them out, bout time
cause it's been on my mind lately how
zee you always supported me
you vouched, i will never forget that and
how you guys, accepted me for me and pace
i love you too, you slept on my couch
and i been thinkin' bout the time i slept on the floor at the outhouse
rhyming is all we ever wanted to do
and regardless how life has turned out
inside i'll always be an outsider
my life has been turned inside out but i

it's a fine, fine line
it's a fine, fine line


i feel phenomenal as usual
pharmaceuticals, glue stick to crucify me at bonnaroo
but i don't know if i'm in tennessee, chicago, or houston
in the corner trying to seek solitude
shallow but such a hollow dude
i won't even swallow solid food
alcoholic too, plus i'm on lean like the tower of pisa
top it off i'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you
roses to violet mollies are blue
lost in a ball of confusion
its all an illusion
it's probably the shrooms i'm on
cause i think i started hallucinating
cause i just thought i just heard jay electronica and odd future's new shit
and all i can do is follow the music
and end up with paula abdul at lollapalooza
fillin' water balloons with nail polish remover
just a problem in wallowing fumes
i feel uptight i gotta get looser
after i finish polishing off this bottle of booze i got a solution
concentrated like orange juice so i'm not as diluted
cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
excusez-moi but that coochie that passed
you see her ass? wouldn't make her my main squeeze
but juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer
it's mouth waterin' too so i walked up to it like i'm marshall
wanna try to meet my standards? i'll introduce ya
oh i'm a misogynist too but i'm not a masseuse
but my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth
a chronic abuser, not only user of marijuana
i mean verbal assault that i use to smoke all of you losers
got a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a glock, and a nuke
and a rottweiler too, i'm not in the mood so
when i say i'm bringing the tec out
i'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
god, i'm gonna puke
i'm so gone off the hookah
i think i swallowed a loofah
i'm tore up, demolished, a fuckin' stone like oliver
like i looked medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
the thoughts i produce are loony tunes
the box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
to replace next up veronica's boobs
and a paychecks that were stuffed in a glove box
in a blue honda with used condoms were clues
the girl was just not the one suitable for him

<i>[hook:]</i>
right for me will change me rearrange my head to be
just right for you and me donât laugh, please listen
donât laugh, please listen

thought i could endure the pressure
collapse and crumble perhaps
relapsing under that
well that's a bunch of crap
in the clutch, i'm the captain crunch of rap
and i'm sick of acting humble thats enough of that
fuck that shit, cut the sack
like its a natural reaction
that's why i'm actually trapped in this shoving match
cause push keeps coming to that
i can keep getting my ass kicked, keep it coming back
like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit so mad
disgruntled had some struggles yeah
but that passionate hunger's back
the fantastic juggling act
and the way i flip my tongue on the track
it's like verbal acrobatics
but in fact
last time i tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
i fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
after i strapped the duffel bag to my back
and stuck the massive punchin' bag in it
an elastic bungee strap, proper plaster, a thumb tack
and a piece of plastic bubble wrap
went spastic and fuckin' snapped
jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
and landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
and for my last trick, lunge on back lash
on a nasa shuttle flap, fuckin' snapped the rudder in half
chuckled and laughed, buttaled my last rebuttal
and just asked him to come crash
and i go grab my go-go-gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress
and ceramic construction hat
rubbed my magic mushroom tat
fell off then splat, get up from that
face taped to a waste paper basket
throw up then gas, lungs collapse
and that's more likely than finding someone that's

<i>[hook]</i>

couple of shots of jã¤ger
public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
flooded with thoughts of anger
while i was away i know probably some of you got to thinkin'
"you're top ten ain't cha?" stop cause you fuckers are talkin' crazy
and stop interrupting you're not even up in the conversation
whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
underground, pop, or nameless, whatever your job is
i came to fuck with your occupation
you're thinkin' just cause you came in with scrubs
and you brought the scalpel and sponge
the oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
stuck in the operating room
once you done, swapped your name with him
smuggled in ronald reagan
if you duck him up donald fagen
while juggling waffles baking
fuckin' mcdonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle
they flung it across the table
then bump it and knock it shake it
jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration
i said fuck it and lost my patience
since they all woke up from sedation
ain't none of you doctor dre
so then what does it got you thinkin'
that you can fuck with this operation
aftermath, still running hip-hop amazing
i'm still pluggin' along
no need for an assumption
here's confirmation
i'm up for the long duration
i'm just looking for something to walk away with
some pocket change and a little integrity
though i'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
till i'm fuckin' madonna's age and
stuck in an awkward place in my life
but i shit you not like i'm fucked up with constipation
that day will come before i stumble upon some ladies

detroit!

<i>[dej loaf:]</i>
tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
i swear i love my city, i just want a little static

i took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
all these females need to email to make noise
and now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
then he shall sea shells, but not by the seashore
if he gang bangin' or not
it's simple as the alphabet
he f with me, that g shall surely see
he definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's sweet
the honest gesture
the trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
the same soldier, it's me, myself and i
ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
range rover, this ain't the squash beef state
you thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' lark voorhies face
the twin eagles ol' air his coup might as well ride by in the ambulance
my pair ol' shoot like sky divin' in hammer pants
so call it siblinð¿ rivalry
take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
a wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
real talk, i don't got time to evict these clowns
y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but i don't sip tea
(that's nickel) ridin' around this block
all we knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(i got a question) do you wanna ride or die?

<i>[big sean:]</i>
shawn don
(welcome to detroit)
boy i need no half's a half, i want the game in entirety
hundred percent cut, no stitches required
welcome to detroit where is you get that promotion
don't worry, man those bullets will still be at your ass firin'
i still call it safe, i would suck if i was umpiring
boy hit the beat &amp; just treat that shit like it's a diary
i'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
self made, i've never needed your bail or a wire, see
i'm never callin' collect, i call to collect
my homie wanted a chevy so i put my dawg in a vet
ha plus i'm so loyal that that paper, boys, is all that i fetch
if the the ball in my hand then the ball in the net
bitch i'm the d, can't no offense dunk on me
i'm mr. big shot, these hoes get drunk off me
i'm over respected, my mama gated community's over protective
so futuristic, i'm already over my next bitch
reminiscin' all listening to fifty fifty times a day
back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
tryin' to get paid fifty ways a day
used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
twenty six and i done lived a life time a few times
from futons to grey poupon's
in church tryin' to get a little savings, yeah coupon
i spit that aone every day, i'm hittin' new primes
now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
naw it's the same, we been laborin' for years
i know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
i turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a beatle though
don't want to, i need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
when you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
this is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

<i>[dej loaf:]</i>
tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
i swear i love my city, i just want a little static
see me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
detroit vs. everybody

<i>[danny brown:]</i>
comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the d
arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
cause i'm a linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on grand river
if you think your hood harder then i might beg to differ
know some killas pull the trigger for a swisher and miller
if the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo ass not remembering
they say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
so nigga i'm a veteran, retire my letterman
had k's in front ya school, but i ain't going to ketteran
cough up a lung, three hundred and thirteen where i'm from
ghan got me cross eyed like bernstein's son
any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
it's us vs. them, detroit vs everybody

<i>[eminem:]</i>
lately it seems as if it's me against the world
like it was before my life became a movie
and they used to use my mother fuckin' trailer to tease me with
but i flipped that script like a refilla a
painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
it made me feel amazing, navy seal of bravery
and if i may reiterate, i ain't even need a script
ain't bein' conceited
but i made it to radio, eat a dick
i still never abc'd the shit
mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller
since before they called jay dee dilla
i was daydreamin' one day i would be the shit
and if i ever end up escapin' the streets i swear that i would stay here
still in it, i'm crazy, i'll always be real
don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the mercedes dealer
peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage to crazy?
for me to flip
what's makin' you think i need a switch? cause i'm adrian peterson
when he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
on the track get spanked like he just did
(detroit!) i can't never leave this bitch
sick of bein' treated like me and shit
but jesus, i can see just why people quit callin' me to do features
and them cyphers on bet cause if
i wasn't me, i probably wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit
seems to be reachin' it's fever pitch
one hundred and eighty degrees in here
shoulder blade full of cedar chips
mc's just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of swedish fish
or lorena with a two penises
hateful and genius ness, inconvenience
and for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life
when i'm makin' you cling
may consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows may be in or another crazy winter
cause so cold in the d, it is as days begin to tick away
but ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blond
but ain't we sick of bein' underdogs
don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit
may even seem as if
i'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which i'm sayin' shit
is playin' with ya but ain't shit changin'
and it's still the same shit and shady's still a lady killer
since the day i went insane and then attacked the babysitter
with the potato peeler mushed her face into the entertainment center
it's like another plane just entered into ukraine again
the bermuda triangle and attempted to make a safe descent
awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'for you came here?
and if they mention us

<i>[dej loaf:]</i>
tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
i swear i love my city, i just want a little static
see me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
detroit vs. everybody

<i>[trick trick:]</i>
what up though, it's the godfather trick trick. you either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on. that means detroit vs. everybody! hey em let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood, let the little homies get this remix crackin'.

detroit!
okay! <i>[echo]</i>


yo, if you could just, for one minute
or one split second in time, forget everything
everything that bothers you, all your problems
everything, and follow me

if i was frozen inside of a moment
if i could capture time inside a capsule
an hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
if i can grasp it, and just control what happens to it
then i can trap it, so no more time elapses through it
if raps could do it, maybe i could tap into it
then i could try to channel it through cadillacs and buicks
to transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it
and that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
and as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent
you're mashin' to it, moshing until you're black and bluish
you're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
true it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unit
uniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just

lose yourself in this music
this moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
you better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
there is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
lose yourself in this music
this moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
you better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
there is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)

cause when we descend together, we begin to move as one
in perfect unison just like the moon and sun
illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
but if you could lose it once, i mean if you could let shit go
relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
to rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me
if i could give the world a hit of ecstasy
to make 'em feel the feeling that i'm feeling right this minute
cause i feel like the night won't end til i get finished
so close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it
the sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
a high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
but no one really gives a fuck cause they just like what's spinnin'
his life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
like life's beginning, so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it

lose yourself in this music
this moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
you better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
there is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
lose yourself in this music
this moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
you better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
there is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)


<i>[beyoncã© (eminem):]</i>
i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
i walk on water
but only when it freezes (fuck)

<i>[eminem:]</i>
why are expectations so high?
is it the bar i set?
my arms, i stretch, but i can't reach
a far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
soon as i grab, squeeze
i lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
into the dark i plummet, now the sky's blackenin'
i know the mark's high, butterflies rip apart my stomach
knowin' that no matter what bars i come with
you're gonna harp, gripe, and
that's a hard vicodin to swallow, so i scrap these
as pressure increases like khakis
i feel the ice cracking, because

<i>[beyoncã© (eminem):]</i>
i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
(it's the curse of the, it's the curse of the)
i walk on water (shit)
but only when it freezes

<i>[eminem:]</i>
it's the curse of the standard, that the first of the mathers disc set
always in search of the verse that i haven't spit yet
will this step just be another misstep
to tarnish, whatever the legacy, love or respect
i've garnered?
the rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
and it always feels like i'm hittin' the mark
'til i go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
like, "this shit is garbage!"
god's given me all this, still i feel no different regardless
kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
if only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
and i try not to listen to nonsense
but if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
mission accomplished
i'm not god-sent
nas, rakim, pac, b.i.g., james todd smith, and i'm not prince, so

<i>[beyoncã©:]</i>
i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
i walk on water
(it's true, i'm a rubik's, it's true)
but only when it freezes
(it's true)

'cause i'm only human, just like you
making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
i don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'cause i'm terrified to let you down, oh

<i>[eminem:]</i>
it's true, i'm a rubik's, a beautiful mess
at times juvenile, yes, i goof and i jest
a flawed human, i guess
but i'm doin' my best to not ruin your expectations and meet 'em, but first
the "speedom" verse, now big sean
he's going too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
there was a time i had the world by the balls, eating out my palm
every album song i was spazzin' the fuck out on
and now i'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
but the only one who's looking down on
me that matters now's deshaun
am i lucky to be around this long?
begs the question though
especially after the methadone
as yesterday fades and the dresden home
is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
the crowds are gone
and it's time to wash out the blonde
sales decline, the curtains drawn
they're closing the set, i'm still poking my head from out behind
and everyone who has doubt, remind
now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
and as i grow outta sight, outta mind, i might go outta mine
'cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight
when i made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
but when i do fall from these heights though, i'll be fine
i won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
but i'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause

<i>[beyoncã©:]</i>
i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
i walk on water
but only when it freezes

'cause i'm only human, just like you
i've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
i don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'cause i'm terrified to let you down, oh
if i walked on water, i would drown

<i>[eminem:]</i>
'cause i'm just a man
but as long as i got a mic, i'm godlike
so me and you are not alike
bitch, i wrote "stan"


and i started from the bottom
like a snowmanâground-up
like round chuck, and still put hands on you
stayin' wound up is how i spend time (get it?)
sucker free, confidence high
such a breeze when i pen rhymes
i just got that air about me like wind chimes (yeah)
another day in the life (uh)
used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)
now my community's gated and i
made it and my neighbors say hi (say hi)
i'm givin' 'em pounds, i'm upscale now
guess it means i'm way in the sky (way in the sky)
but i still remember the days of
minimum wage for general labor
welfare recipient since a minor
look how government assistance has made ya!
adversity, if at first you don't succeed
put your temper to more use
'cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
that should only give you more fuel
show 'em why you're you
so close, god, it's like i almost got it
but close only counts in time, bombs and horseshoes
so i unabomb shitâtick, tick, tickâno remorse, pew!
screw it, i'm lit, and that attitude i blew up on quick
that's why they call me firecracker
i grew up on wicâwick, wick, wickâwith a short fuse
i got some important news to report to
anyone who thought i was done: nah bitch, not quite
spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

do you still believe in me?
didn't i give everything i had to give you to make you see?
i'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
and walk out, i will never let you live it down
i'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

man, i know sometimes
these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
to me they're just ink blots
i just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
so you might wanna think it over twice (yeah)
when you retards can roll the dice
but beef will at least cost you your career
'cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
but this middle finger's free as a bird
nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on earth
too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
how to incorporate a curse
point it towards corporate america
stick a fork in and turn
'cause four-letter words are more better heard
the world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
but sometimes i overdo it, but i just get so into it
i was there consolin' you when no one knew it
when your situation showed no improvement
i was that door, you walked over to it
i'm the light at the end of tunnel
so people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
when that tunnel vision is unclear
shit becomes too much to bear
since "cleanin' out my closet"
when i was havin' trouble with the snare
i'm that unrealistic prayer answered
and i'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
when you struggle with despair
that double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
of nuts i'm cuppin', i am your fuckin' switch, nothin' can compare

do you still believe in me?
didn't i give everything i had to give you to make you see?
i'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
and walk out, i will never let you live it down
i'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

started from the bottom like a snowman
oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
but my battery's low, i'ma need a boost to my pack
and i know that i always got proof at my back
i called you "proof" because i knew for a fact
my ace in the hole, homie, i'm callin' on you
'cause i think i'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
give me that apron and moâ
âtivation to go, hussein with the flow
fake fans left you two-faced at the show
let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
layin' vocals two days in a row
true statement, hate to go down this road
but there's only one route to cross this bridge
so i walk in this bitch with loose change
'cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
but it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
that goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
use the tools you're given!
or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
as an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
i used to play the loser/victim
'til i saw the way proof was driven
i found my vehicle and i haven't ran out of gas yet
and when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
fanny packs, hourglasses
if time was on my side, i'd still have none to waste
man, in my younger days
that dream was so much fun to chase
it's like i'd run in place
while this shit dangled in front of my face
but how do you keep up the pace
and the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
when that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grã¢ce
still you feel the need to go full tilt
that bruce willis, that blue steel, that true skill
when that wheel's loose, i won't lose will
do you still believe?

instinctive nature, to bring the anguish (yeah) to the english language
with this ink, you haters get wrote on like a piece of paper
this rap shit got me travelin' place to place, you barely leave your house
'cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
yeah, that's why when i brainstorm, gotta write it out
simon cowell's rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
why your bound notebook got tied around your throat
hook it inside your mouth, go...
that's what it's like when the mic is out
'cause i'm tearin' at your fleshful dead
'til your larynx and neck are split
with these lyrics, weapons expert with
like hair extensions, extra clips
and you're scared to effin' death of it
bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
in a pair of sketcher, sweatshirt ripped
and hoodie black, should be strapped to a chair or stretcher
electric, swear on every record, bitch
finger so high in the air, i bet your senses flip
like a barometric pressure switch
carin' less who i offend with this
i'm at your neck like pez dispense
go 'head, spit your flow, bitch...

<i>[eminem:]</i>
yeah, uh
and still conjoined at the hip with hop
still on point and poignant
skilled as floyd is
and it's filled and still no filter, boy
i'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy
you still ain't in the buldin', boy
i will destroy shit, even as i build it
get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
like what? like a real thin joint, it
what? comes on quilted northern
and what? in a built-in toilet
yeah, bitch i told you i'm a dog (woof, woof)
i wouldn't heal with ointment
way i'm kickin' these fairies tails
should write a children's storybook (yeah)
million voices in my head, but still get a little bit of thrill
and some real enjoyment
off what? off the feel of going in
like? like your bitch when she gives me brain
like she thinks i'm dumb
grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'til i feel anointed
she makes iller noises
when she's with me, must be from the windy city
pretty apparent, she's a m.i.l.f. when blowin' me
'cause like kandor and two, rippin' the condom in two, woo
dick is a bargain or two, now i'm gettin' blue like kolonopins
rude jude, i go there, you wouldn't
well, i still have a few views, and comment on you

you're a has-been
that has been the case since back when
you last went and threw your hat in the race
you've been trash
stick your raps in the trash bin
or end up in my next rhyme
you're a fuckboy, so next time
it's gonna be heads flyin' like dez bryant
with a tec-nine against rex ryan, yeah!
now watch me set it like correct time
all you get is sloppy seconds like a timex time
i clock rejects into the next line
talkin' reckless, that is just my
strongest suit, but you can get my
columbian neck tie
prostitute just climb in the humvee and lets ride
why you hitching at night?
i put an end to your life (sex crime)
kidding aside, insidious vibe
girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
but all you're getting is bribe
ending your life to try to get you inside
then we gon' end up spending the night
and i'm skinning your hide like an indian tribe
what kind of nut drives a budweiser truck
finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her
up, binds up, cuts, slices her twice
but the muff diver must just like it rough
fuck right in her vagina, blood
flies up, under thighs, ugh, like a gyser, uh
music, please
enthusi', instead of roofie
goal is to get a floozie inside the jacuzzi
and have a loosie, goosey as coozie is with an uzi
but i am to rap what blue jeans mean to bruce springsteen
glued me be, i'm trutv, you're too pg
i'm schoolly d, you're spoony, g
no diss there, just notice there are no similarities that we share
besides the fact we breathe air
happily married, to rap and i'm glad that we buried
the hatchet and patched it up
now i'm back to ratchet up my attack

hands up, officer don't shoot
then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
we may never understand each other, it's no use
we ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
pull up on the side of you
window rolled down, 'profile'
then we wonder why we see this side of you
probably comin' from the dope house
we could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
we know you're hidin' that heidi klum
on you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
and just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
in your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
fucked up, but what the fuck am i to do?
i keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
no matter how many lives you ruin
it's for the red, white and blue
time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
no one's ever indicted you
why? 'cause you're a...

white boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
(my momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)
white boy, white boy, in your cop car
(but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve)
white boy, white boy, you're untouchable
(the world's coming to an end, i don't even care)
nobody can tell me shit cause i'm a (big rockstar)

<i>[eminem:]</i>
black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
we don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
why you kicking that soda can?
pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
throw your ass in the van cuffed
you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
and put our minds more at ease
or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
we're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
that's what we call 'em pigsties for
they're like eyesores to police
talk to you like just a piece of trash
feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
as this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
to the sixties, having black skin is risky
'cause this keeps happening
throughout history, african-americans have been treated like shit
and i admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

<i>[eminem (cheech and chong):]</i>

seems like the average lifespan of a white man
is more than twice than a black life span
i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
i feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
i'd rather hear 'em say "die n-word" than die antwoord
ninja, now it's better disguised banter
but that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
and can't find answers
we're applying, but mcdonald's
seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
so how can we have higher standards?
as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter
we fight back with violence but acts like that are
black eyes on the movement
which makes black lives madder
at cops and cops madder
that's why it's at a stalemate
can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops
i wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
the block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
call the attack dogs off of us, man
you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
and know nobody black so they act afraid of us
and that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
a subconscious racist
wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'cause america segregated us, designated us to an area
separated us, section-eight'd us
when we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
and education sucks, and every day's another
freddie gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
we just want a safe environment for our kids
but can't escape the sirens
don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
the poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
the lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
and we're trapped in these racial biases
that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
every time we see a devil's face
lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
it's more like billy clubs and gats
and we really love it when you think we're guilty 'cause we're black
"but you kill each other, facts
you peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats"
single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
fuck your republican views
pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
and streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
you better be strapped with a derringer
or be "capped in america" like steve rogers
'cause no one oversees these cops and
all we see is 'em beat charges
we done seen 'em beat rodney king unconscious, and got off
so we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
but they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
if you try to slander the flag but
somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
so they call it a kaepernick tantrum
if you don't stand for the national anthem
we raise it, you better praise it
or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
treat you like rodney dangerfield
home of the brave is still racist 'ville
so this whole nation feels like a plantation field
in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals
that had its natives killed
got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
to a piece of cloth that represents the "land of the free" that made people slaves to build

i've been a liar, been a thief

he's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
on his breath's jack, he's a sex addict
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back
it's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
she's kept track of all his internet chats
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'cause she loves danger, psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's girl, even i know that
but she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll be my gwen stacy, to spite her man
and i know she's using me to try to play him, i don't care

one-night stand, turned to a two-night stand
it was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...

he found out, now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left, so what? he did it first to her too
now how am i supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
it's hard to find the words, i'm aloof, nervous, and sue
don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal, i just can't say this in person to you
so i revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
don't have to be reserved in a booth
i just feel like the person who i'm turning into's
irreversible, i preyed on you like it's church at the pew
and now that i got you i don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do i do this dirt that i do?
get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'cause now with her in the womb
we can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
to use protection 'fore i bit into your forbidden fruit
fuck!

fuck can i say? if life was a highway

speeds at a high rate, like i'm slidin' on ice, maybe
that's why i may have came at you sideways
i can't keep my lies straight
but i made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
what else can i say? it was fun for a while
bet i really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
what's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

damn girl
you drive me crazy
you may be crazy too
you make me do things
i normally wouldn't do
you make me feel things
that i never felt
it gotta be the real thing
'cause you remind me of myself


<i>[eminem:]</i>
yo! i bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin
calling all party animals, get
on the floor when i pop up on some whack-a-mole shit
in search of a chick who stacked them so thick
and implants are so big
she can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
like anna nicole smith
body's bananas and sass to go wit'
i spot you at first glance and go "shit!"
you wearin' those pants that don't fit
that butt won't ever give up
that's why you stick it out no matter what
'cause you got an ass that won't quit
so, get on the horn, my saxophone
grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow!
you just laugh and go heehee
'cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
that's why

<i>[eminem, joan jett and the blackhearts:]</i>
i love you, 'cause you remind me of me
that's why i love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
i said i love you, 'cause you remind me of me

<i>[eminem:]</i>
you know, i'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too, yo
with me on it

i'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
the plan's to bring you to my house
you're drinkin' jack and beam
i'm thinkin' soon as trampolines so we should bounce
but you're out of your tube-top
if you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
yeah, you're a cute fox
perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
girl, you're smokin' like snoop dogg
but you must be token if you think you're takin' over my quarters
there goes the dime into the jukebox
two shots of blue hpnotiq and soon i'll
turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
so, rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
and excuse the locker room talk, i'm just too raw
but apparently, so are you, ma
'cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
and that's why

<i>[eminem, joan jett and the blackhearts:]</i>
i love you, 'cause you remind me of me
that's why i love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
i said i love you, 'cause you remind me of me
that's why i love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)

said can i take you home, where we can be alone?
shorty, you the shit
girl, i ordered you to sit
i know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
i only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
so from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
you ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'cause real tits are still fun
but everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

so come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
but tonight, curiosity overrides ya
besides you're fire (i love) like a starter pistol
crystal and slides huns, tonight i'm your pilot
'cause you should be up in the sky, girl
you're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
so come on, baby, the night's young
don't string me along, i'm high-strung
we might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the cy young
fuckin' 'fore we get to the house, screwin' our brains out
like changing a lightbulb
that's why i like ya, 'cause i'm crazy just like ya
now every time i get brain, you screw mine up
i barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
so ready, set, aim and fire
yes, babe, i'm fallin' in likeness kinda, why i love

<i>[eminem, joan jett and the blackhearts:]</i>
i love you, 'cause you remind me of me

i said i love you, 'cause you remind me of me

i've drowned in high from the ashes now
i can't recall your laughter
the smoke of every single grasp but ends of what's left over
and the lights in every broken blown out window screaming, laughing
i love to feel the course hang out
this is our revival


<i>[eminem:]</i>
yeah, shout to everybody
who's been on this trip with me
you don't have to, agree
but if you feel like me

someone get this aryan a sheet
time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
everybody on your feet
this is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
this chump barely even sleeps
all he does is watch fox news like a parrot and repeats
while he looks like a canary with a beak
why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? he's tryin' to divide us
this shit's like a cult, but like johnny he'll only unite us
'cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
similar to when two cars collide 'cause
our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
but here the jaws of life come
to pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
when we can't wear stars and stripes 'cause
this type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
but there's always tomorrow still
if we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
and band together for charlottesville
and for heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
let's start from zero, this is our renewal
spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
america, and here's to where it all

<i>[alicia keys &amp; eminem:]</i>
and here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
here's to the land that made me
and made me who i am, who i am (hands up!)
here's to the land that raised me
this one for the only place that really knows me
from the cracks in the road that drove me
there's no place like home

didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
can't denounce the klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
you stay on twitter, way to get your hate off
nazi, i do not see a way y'all differ
and all you got are race cards, bigot
the swastika with your name carved in it
should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
and you just lick the plate off
so i guess it pays to feed off of chaos
so basically, you ate off hitler!
but you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
so much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
against this train wreck and take a stand
even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
to sing "the star-spangled banner"
this man just praised a statue of general lee
'cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
take it back to the shady national convention
wish i woulda spit on it before i went to shake his hand
at the event or maybe had the wherewithal
to know that he was gonna try to tear apart
our sacred land we cherish and stand for
so, hands in the air, let's hear it for
the start of a brand new america
without him and be proud of where we're from
and here's to where we all

<i>[alicia keys &amp; eminem:]</i>
and here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
here's to the land that made me
and made me who i am, who i am (hands up!)
here's to the land that raised me
this one for the only place that really knows me
from the cracks in the road that drove me
there's no place like home

i won't give up
i won't give up on my home, that so many died for
you already know that i won't give up
i won't give up on my home, that so many died for
you already know
there's no place like home, no place like home
wherever i go, no place like home
no place like home, no place like home
wherever i go (yeah)

and here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
here's to the land that made me
and made me who i am, who i am (hands up!)
here's to the land that raised me
this one for the only place that really knows me
from the cracks in the road that drove me
there's no place like home

we never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
so much baggage, need a luggage rack
but we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
up back in the news, love taps when i dissed you
like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
jump back in the studio, give you a tongue lashing, then you
laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone
it was funny back in our youth
but then it wasn't after we knew
that we were done and actually through (and actually through)
but if there's one fraction of truth
if it could be spun back i would do
so many things different (things different)
'cause it was such a dumbass excuse
you hit me once and that i would use
to continue the pattern of abuse
why did i punch back? girls, your dad is a scumbag, i'm confused
because

how come you can be a lord and a loser?
how come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
a good dad, but a bad husband
why are you a good father?

you were the beat i loved with a writer's block
the line that's hot, that i forgot
we laughed a little, cried a lot
i'll never forget when you came home and you held hailie
day before you went to jail and daily
how we'd wait for that mail lady
or by the phone for mom to call
and i watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
givin' it one more try despite it all
you're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
i'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
when we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
every line we crossed we were supposed to not
every time we fought, the insults, they gotâ¦ thrown too far
words that we said that we didn't mean
the words that we meant that we didn't say
the ones that we thought that we shoulda said
letters written that we coulda read
which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
and had this put to bed
but i'd be lyin' still if i said i wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

how come you can be a lord and a loser?
how come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
a good dad, but a bad husband
why are you a good father?
a great dad, but a bad husband (<i>[hailie:]</i> dad) (you said)
forever be a hero in my eyes (i reply)
but there's always another side to a good father
a great dad, but a bad husband

<i>[eminem:]</i>
we brought out the worst in each other
someone had to make the sparring end
'cause i loved you, but i hated that me
and i don't wanna see that side again
but i'm sorry, kim
more than you could ever comprehend
leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
sawing off a fuckin' body limb
once upon a time where all we had
maybe that's what drew us
to each other, it was true love
shit, we never knew was possible
we might have loved each other too much
and maybe that's what made us do what
we did to each other, all the screw-ups
'cause you always thought that you was
more in love with me
and i was thinkin' i was more in love than you was
for all the times that we thought it worked
'til we saw how wrong we were
when the dust settles now and all the dirt
if i touch the rawest nerve
all i want is for us not to hurt
and it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
but i just heard "mockingbird"
and got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
the purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
i've caused a few and so have you
or argue whose fault it was
partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
this is so tough, i'm gettin' choked up
oh fuck it, we both suck
we broke up, got back together
we both thought we had forever
not bad people, just bad together
we were so nuts, backstabbed each other
another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'cause it's over and it's closure
but i'm not so sure how to close this
i just don't know how some people can be so good
at one thing and so fucked at a whole nother
shit, it's no wonder

<i>[x ambassadors (eminem):]</i>
how come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?

i'm stumbling, i can't see straight
and it's my fault i got this way
i got my hands on something great
and found a way to mess it all up
i did my best, i tried to change
but it's just in my dna
i got my hands on something great
and found a way to fuck it up again
now i'm the one thing
you couldn't hate more
but you're the one thing
that i would die for

<i>[eminem:]</i>
all my life, i was told
i was never nothing special
i don't need to be reminded of it
every other second
'specially when all my self-esteem's
already shot the hell up
falling helplessly, i'm embarrased
and i don't want no one else to see
'cause i feel like i'm a piece of shit
every time she yells at me
selfishly indeed
but definitely doesn't help that she
makes me feel like i've died and gone to heaven
but makes life a living hell for me
she does that thing with her lip
now she's melting me
i'm putty in her palms
i'm wrapped around her finger
a yo-yo on a string
she lets me sit there and just dangle
until something better comes along
and she'll just drop me like a hot potato
i look like i'm in pain
but i'm okay, though
'cause i know she loves me
my friends, what do they know?

<i>[skylar grey:]</i>
it's like i'm drowning at sea
hoping that you reach for me
i know you're there but i can't see
'cause i'm so drunk off tragic endings
i'm dying to breathe
and all you do is strangle me
such a beautiful relief
'cause i'm so drunk off tragic endings
drunk off tragic endings

<i>[eminem:]</i>
in my moments of weakness
i openly admit this shit, i wouldn't normally
i'm extremely self-conscious
and enormously
insecure and she uses it to torture
when she torments me
it only turns to ammunition for her
in this war
when she gets going, she don't stop
when i'm up, she's like a downer
when i found her
it was love at first encounter
plus, somehow, she must've took the carton
of eggs off the counter
cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground
for me to walk on when i'm around her
but there's just something 'bout her
that makes me not able to function without her
how can i get out of it
when i don't know how to?
i'm a doubter, i'm a pessimist
make a believer out of me
and show me the way now
or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'cause i'm going straight down the drain
i'm drowning

<i>[skylar grey:]</i>
it's like i'm drowning at sea
hoping that you reach for me
i know you're there but i can't see
'cause i'm so drunk off tragic endings
i'm dying to breathe
and all you do is strangle me
such a beautiful relief
'cause i'm so drunk off tragic endings

now i'm the one thing
you couldn't hate more
but you're the one thing
that i would die for

<i>[eminem:]</i>
it took a while for me to get it
but i think i've figured it out
she don't want me, she just don't wanna
see me with someone else
the idea of seeing me happy
destroys her in itself
to see me falling to pieces
brings her joy, brings her hell
but it annoys her to see me
get this straight, then say "screw her"
i threw up on myself, i'm dumb sick
i'm addicted to her
she's tryna block the door
so here's how i do her
since i'm manure, she's a sewer
this time, this piece of shit's running through her
i can see that right now, i'm running to it
what the fuck? should've knew it
who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
as soon as i hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid
she's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

<i>[skylar grey:]</i>
it's like i'm drowning at sea
hoping that you reach for me
i know you're there but i can't see
'cause i'm so drunk off tragic endings

'cause i'm so drunk off tragic endings

feeling kinky, lip syncing to too $hort's "freaky tales" (biatch!)
having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
and envisioning sneaking into where christie brinkley dwells
i know this is risky thinking but i wanna stick her like she's decals
but when murdering females
better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
if you get scratched because your dna'll
be all up under her fingernails
man, he hears you, i don't think he cares
he gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
her tv blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
she's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
turns around and screams, i remember distinctly
i said "i'm here to do sink repairs."
chop her up, put her body parts
in front of steven avery's trailer and leave 'em there

but hey man, i was framed
i know what this looks like, officers
please just give me one minute
i think i can explain
i ain't murdered nobody
i know these words are so nutty
but i'm just here to entertain
how come your shirt is so bloody?
there's a missing person, so what? he's
got nothin' to do with me
i'm almost certain i was framed

woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
think i'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that i'm on
donald duck's on, there's a tonka truck in the yard
but dog, how the fuck is ivanka trump in the trunk of my car?
gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
plus i feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
second murder with no recollection of it
collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'cause the disassembled body
was covered up in the snow since the month of november oddly
i'm wanted for questioning
them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

but hey man, i was framed
i know what this looks like, officers
please just give me one minute
i think i can explain
i ain't murdered nobody
i know these words are so nutty
but i'm just here to entertain
how come your shirt is so bloody?
there's a missing person, so what? he's
got nothin' to do with me
i'm almost certain i was framed

still on the loose, they
spotted me inside mcdonald's tuesday
in a toronto blue jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
with rihanna, lupe, saddam hussein, bobby boucher
or was it cool j? the cops is on a goose chase
just escaped from the state pen
for <i>[edited]</i> eight women who hate men
don't make it no weirder, i'm naked
when i break in your basement
under your baby's play pen, i lay in, wait adjacent
facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
you'll get the hint, ho: i'm in your window
but it never occurred to me i could describe a murder scene
in a verse and be charged with first degree
'cause it just happened to match up perfectly
with the massacre or the burger king burglary
no, officer, you see...

i was framed
i know what this looks like, officers
please just give me one minute
i think i can explain
i ain't murdered nobody
i know these words are so nutty
but i'm just here to entertain
how come your shirt is so bloody?
there's a missing person, so what? he's
got nothin' to do with me

ashes blowing in the air.
our world's on fire, but we don't care.
wasted youth, always on the road,
never looking back and we're never getting old
'cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold.
fuck doing what you're told.
we're going nowhere fast.

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i feel sorry for this beat.
sympathy pains for this track.
this road is taking me back
down memory lane with this rap.
i can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback.
i'm simply stating a fact:
i had wembley stadium packed.

but now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast.
another terrorist attacks
like a tariff blows half of madison square up. alas.
we perish in the blast,
but that isn't scaring us.
we pass nowhere, we're fearless
'cause we're just

ashes blowing in the air.
our world's on fire, but we don't care.
we don't give aâ¦ no, no.

fuck doing what you're told.
act like a two-year old.
shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways.
for mcs it's a funeral
when i'm devising this rhyme
'cause i'm awake and you're mourning.
that's why i rise and i shine
like a new day has dawned on me.

gusto, guts, bravado.
nuts and plus i kick up dust and cuss a lot.
i must have got you in somewhat of a debacle
'cause some stuff that's awful
really don't mean nothing although
there's a lot of shit i said in jest that's tough to swallow.

but if at times my heart it seems like it's in the wrong place.
it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve.
keanu reeves. speed of life.
avoid or veer or just steer toward it.
we're only looking forward, but
where we're going. we have no idea.

nowhere to go but hysterical.
it's getting warm in here. i set the world on fire.
was born to be an arsonist.
just one spark and it's lit,
but i'mma still get dark on this shit.
told you i'd leave my mark on this bitch.

war machine? but you've forced me in a corner
i'm sure to have something for your rear
and in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe.
go to war with me you'll end up blew to timbuktu.
i send at you a ten-ton nuke like kim jong-un
and end up ruining your career.

but when all is said and done
and at the end of my run
i just rewind clocks.
forever young.
make time stop.
will i ever fall off? that day'll never come
'til the pine box. bitch, fuck you!
i'm better than i ever was.

'til the bomb drops, hope it never does
but i'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
this world's screwed,
it's already fucked and i'm on top.
so everyone's just

(wanna take it from the top?)

lady you remind me of my raps on that relapse shit
cause you got an ass thick as them accents
two ass cheek implants, call that an asset
'cause you could stick a glass on it, it's massive
from the first time i saw you i actually said to myself, "i gotta meet her like a taxi"
exactly, love affair in the backseat
sorry if i'm being graphic, but i'm stiff as a statue
you sat on a shelf, i feel like i'm a bust
maybe i'm just ahead of myself
let me slow down, slow your camaro
i'm tryna catch up, i'm tryna' jump your bones to the marrow
got me under your control and your spell
wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
grab you by the (meow), hope it's not a problem in fact
about the only fact i agree on with donald is that
so when i put this palm on your cat
don't snap, it's supposed to be grabbed
why do you think they call it a snatch
i just wanna climb in the sack
i'ma keep it one hundred, like my speedometer's at
i'm watching you rap, i'm the dude following in back
about six cars back, i'm in the lac
and i want to (uh)

all day, all day, all night
you ask, i stay the night
with you, you say you're vile
me too, you're burning up
i'm running...

all day, all night
you feel, my heat (fire...)
feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
but those jeans you wore, like i've never seen before
i pretend to work there, while i clean the floor
checking you out, like the clerk, while he rings you up
pull up behind you while you're leaving and you don't even know it (ayo, rick, man)
she's brushing her hair, adjusting her mirror, she's rapping my shit
but she wasn't aware, i was there, or maybe she was, and just didn't care
who knows, at least that isn't up in the air
it's something to see
but just like a girl who thinks her coochie doesn't stink
if she ain't planning to do shit, this summers eve
maybe she wants to keep me company
but fuck the pepã© le pew shit!
"ain't steppin' to you, bitch," i say to myself
plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail
like a skunk in heat
i could sweat her to some degree
but fuck it, i'm the male, let her come to me
(could you repeat that again?)
let her come to me, male sweater, some degree, fail
fuck it, pull up beside her
sideswipe her, dodge vipe-her
what is a brighter ass if she wants a computer lodged in her vagina?
said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
i said...

all day, all day, all night
you ask, i stay the night
with you, you say you're vile
me too, you're burning up
i'm running...

all day, all night
you feel, my heat (fire...)
feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

black out, come to, hands covered in blood
motherfucking gloves and a shover stuck in the mud
i just bodied the beat, so that hoe must've been dug
cause it just died like "ooh, food coloring, duh"
so let's get turnt, like a shish kebab, twist it ma
like an air conditioning knob
we be great together
don't care if it takes forever
if i gotta wait, i guess it's better late than never
you felt my heat, rubbing off on you
i love your personality
come on, little mama, you're hot enough to melt rick's beat
come jump in the water, i bet you get your self esteem
from your persona
with an ass to match, girl your body is lit
you're striking, i'm a gas
girl, you're just gonna have to put the mother chumps on the back burner
you got puns, i got asperger's
just let me rest my head in between that set of ds
while i shred mc's, like cheddar cheese
that's just the thoroughbred me in me, ain't a better breed
my dog thinks so too, look at my predigree
ma, the world is what i think of you
i think you're divine, so i might swing on you
i'm just kidding girl, i wouldn't lift a finger or two
unless it's the middle finger, to finger you

all day, all day, all night
you ask, i stay the night
with you, you say you're vile
me too, you're burning up
i'm running...

feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

under ones and twos, threes and four (the morning)
wait for the cut like neosporin (what?)
he's mixing it up for me and lauren
a teddy like short for theodore
we're outtie, five thousand

(who the fuck, it's my big dick, so everybody get ready right fucking now)


you claim if you get knocked by the cops
you'll give 'em not even a statement
walk in the arraignment, shoot the bailiff
karate kick the plaintiff
gotti with the stainless
i'll just call it shoddy entertainment
if y'all was in the party gettin' faded
on molly, had the audience sedated
you wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
probably let it fall and hit the pavement
but you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
bitch, stop bein' a lame
your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
like you was tommy lynn sells
and chainsawing them in the basement
hardly fits your job description
ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like, "oh my god, he's trippin'"
only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
i need to stop bein' debated
you're still copyin', xeroxing, i'm still coppin' a feel
like bill cosby at will, popping a pill then spill oxys in jill's coffee
then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
this blonde fuck's reprehensible misconducts, never sensible
kiss my butt, my set of principles is gone
but 'til i get the president to respond
my pen and pencil is a missile launcher
and send it to mitch mcconnell
just as big of a bitch as donald
shit's on, bruh
let me sing this shit soprano
while i do it pizzicato
ivanka, stiff arm her
while i'm hittin' on melania
and this song's for all ya

'cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms
(i hope you offended)
and drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
but i'ma make you eat your words
(i hope you offended)
you can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'cause you're only gonna make things worse
(i hope you offended)
'cause i swear when i get up i'm never gonna let up
'til everybody eats my turds

these drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
like justin ross harris at a nursery
goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
i'm gettin' handys with the zanny xannys in the caddy armrest
i'm imagining objects, so i'm batting cobwebs
from a daddy longleg
and hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
xanax, a banana hammock and a santa hat
i'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
with a chick that looks like janet jackson with a spanish accent
twice her age and i'm actin' half it
grow up? nah
not that i know of, y'all
basement just got a frickin' overhaul, got a stripper pole installed
started rollin' all through those kolonopins like a bowlin' ball
like an overdose on twice the ratio of propofol and go through no withdrawal
while i get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blow-up doll of rachel dolezal
you're so appalled, so's my manager
bitch i'm amateur, fuck a pro career
coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
and nobody's close, so don't compare
they ain't nowhere near, i'm way over here
my competition can't see me
'cause i don't own a mirror
but marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
i'm so narcissistic, when i fart, i sniff it
do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
but i made strides with these rape lines
i'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
like ray rice when he facetimes
bang, bang, bang, bang time
dang knives'll butcher them gay wives
you're gonna need sutures the same size
as the blade i push into captcha
when i pull 'em like sleigh rides
gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
to make it on dateline
i came to stake my claim like a canine
waitin' in a buffet line
so kellyanne conway, i'm a really bad hombre
come play, belly dance on me
i've been making wedding plans all day

'cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms
(i hope you offended)
and drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
but i'ma make you eat your words
(i hope you offended)
you can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'cause you're only gonna make things worse
(i hope you offended)
'cause i swear when i get up i'm never gonna let up
'til everybody eats my turds

eight year old with the wordplay
girl, take this pole like a survey
today wasn't my birthday
but i'm caked up like a dessert tray
so we're in shape
'cause you're in a slurrin' state
i'm a ten, you're an eight, like what i do before, after, and during rape
you wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
and they made a fool out of what i pulled out him
r. kelly with a full bladder
non-high school grad, i'm not a scholar
but i'm so cold when i'm droppin' knowledge my degrees
it's the same as i got in college (zero)
but nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
i owe you nada like haloti, partner blow me
told you i'm so dirty, homie you can throw me in some holy water
with some floaties on
and get the soap, and try to get the pope to hold me
while you hose me off and nope i won't be washed
you hope to god i don't explode, i gotta blow this spot up, though
i got a lotta more
i won't put the sugar coating on it though
'cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
you feel like a wet pile of crap
but look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh
i get why you're tapped
but you gotta get your fire back
catch fire, get upset and fire back
is what i tell myself
when times get bad
'cause sometimes i might get sad
but i take the same advice i had
and tell myself like i used to tell hailie, when life's a drag
told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
'cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
i'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
i'm right in your ass (sodomy)
'fore the pen, i stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
you ain't have to have no money or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
now my dough's amountin' to a mountain, it's rised too high to count it
never asked to be rich, all i did was wish i had a dime for every time that i was doubted
but then i think about it and i'm enraged
'cause i just figured out that if i was paid
for the time i spent to put the pen to the page
it'd be minimum wage
but it's embedded in my head. i never hunted for the bread and butter
what i wanted was to be the one that they were scared of
but i'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood i put up in the pen
and when i'm dead i wonder will they put me on a pedestal
or forget i was ever this incredible
i guess i better go harder than ever 'cause i'll never get
another motherfuckin' opportunity again
to offend as many people with this i can, simply because i can

'cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms
(i hope you offended)
and drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
but i'ma make you eat your words
(i hope you offended)
you can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'cause you're only gonna make things worse
(i hope you offended)
'cause i swear when i get up i'm never gonna let up
'til everybody eats my turds


<i>[pink:]</i>
you're drunk

we drive one another crazy as each other

where you at? at a friend's? no, you ain't, mothafucker!
but i give her the benefit of the doubt
whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when i touch her
'cause i love her so much, i'm a sucker
how her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
she's in hot water, think i caught her cheating again
give her another chance? another one after that?
i'm swimming in that egyptian river, 'cause i'm in denial
say i don't eat shit, but i got a shit-eating grin when i smile
making an excuse for us to act it out
she's just acting out with her inner child
then i set the truth on fire
'cause i'd rather believe a lie
then i breathe a sigh of relief, i don't believe in
going to bed mad, i keep on trying
to make a bad girl good
but haven't i stood by you in good times?
and bad? i'm starting to feel like your goddamn dad
'cause i literally feel like you could die if ever should i
leave you for good and never would i
it'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
but i think i'm a pretty damn good guy
and you're a good person too
i can save you, i can make you change
but i keep putting my fucking foot in my mouth
every time i gotta come and bail you out
when you get in trouble that you get yourself in
and i'm in trouble, but i can't leave, i'll sell you out
i could never turn my fucking back on youâwhat is that?
i'm co-dependent, i'm just now noticing it
but somehow it's like every time i'm about to go to end it
i ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
our apartment's tore apart
you're using my heart for a dartboard
but god must've aligned stars for us
'cause somebody paired us up
and they say he ain't capable of making a mistake
but this one's perfect, 'cause i'mâ

i'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as i can fit
and i'm just drivin' as far as i can get
away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows i forget
what's tomorrow like? 'cause tonight i'm startin' life again
get to the corner and stop, fuck am i goin'?
besides psycho when i fantasize startin' my whole life over
yeah right, oh and i might go and
get hypnotized so i don't even recognize no one
i try to look alive because there's nothin' like holdin'
your head up high when you're dead inside and i just hide, so in
case you're wonderin' why are my inside's showin'
'cause i done spilled all my guts and those are mine so i'm
pickin' them up and stuffin' them back
fuck it, i've done enough in this rap shit
recovery brought me nothin' but back
to right where i was and perhaps
this coulda been my victory lap if i wasn't on the verge of relapse

it seems to be the reoccurring main theme
the shit i would daydream as a kid, i was eighteen
i went from an irate teenager to still raging
as an adult, amazing: back then i put anything
into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
i spit it, the mainstream, i hit it
yay me, i did it! did what?
hailie, baby, i didn't mean to make you eighty
percent of what i rapped about
maybe i shoulda did a better job at separating
shady and entertaining from real life
but this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
it's the craziest shit i
ever seen, and back then it was like i ain't even
bothered taking into consideration
you one day being older and may hear me say things
i did it, pay me, and be, it just ain't me
okay, so ladies and gentlemen let's strip away everything
and see the main reason that i feel like a lame piece of shit
or should i sound cranky and bitter
complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'cause when i look at me, i don't see what they see
i feel ashamed, greedy and lately i've been contemplating
escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
it's making me crazy what's in my?

i built this castle
now we are trapped on the throne
i'm sorry weâre alone
i wrote my chapter
you'll turn the page when i'm gone
i hope youâll sing along
this is your song
i just want you to know that i ain't scared
whatever it takes to raise you, i'm prepared
to do whatever, to do whatever
december onest, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, dear hailie

you'll be coming out of mommy's stomach soon
i better do something quick if i'ma be able to support you
i can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
that's all that matters for the time being
but obviously assuming you will be
just thinking ahead, iâma make it if it kills me
letâs see how far i can take it with this music
i'm getting sick of chasing this illusion
sorry for sloppy writing
the pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me
dadâs a little nervous, but at the same time excited
if i use this same energy while i'm saying rhymes and write them
with the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
as i'm using in this letter, maybe they can feel me as i'm
trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
for you to sit on the throne, i got plans, baby girl
welcome to mom and dadâs crazy world
love, daddy, maple flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup

you got your momma's personality, same eyes as i got
her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
sorry for that, a little minor mishap
but you'll grow into them, baby, i'm on the grind now
i'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
while i'm tryna keep the lights on
why does it seem like i'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
i just keep steering, i'ma turn into someone
i haven't the slightest clue what i'ma do if it falls through
you took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
my infinite cd flopped, too many soft tunes
they're talking bad about dad, it's ticking me off too
makes me feel like i don't belong or something, ooh
i think i might have just stumbled onto something new
got a prediction for the future, i'm hoping that you
open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

now if you found these letters, i guess i better try to explain
a lot's happened in between them since i rised to this fame
i've said your name but always tried to hide your face
this game is crazy, i wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
i never knew it'd be like this, if i did i wouldn't have done it
you ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
i can't stomach, they can take this fame back, i don't want it
i'll put out this last album then i'm done with it
one-hundred percent finished
fed up with it, i'm hanging it up, fuck it
excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
that i'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
and if things should worsen, don't take this letter i wrote
as a goodbye note, 'cause your dad's at the end of his rope
i'm sliding down a slippery slope
anyways sweetie, i better go
i'm getting sleepy, love, dadâ¦ shit, i don't know


if i could rewind time like a tape
inside a boombox
one day for every pill
or percocet that i ate
cut down on the valium
i'da heard everything
but death is turning so definite, wait
they got me all hooked up to some machine
i love you, bean
didn't want you to know i was struggling
feels like i'm underwater
submerged like a submarine
just heard that nurse say
my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
been flirtatious with death
skirt-chasing, i guess
it's arrivederci
same nurse, just heard say
they're unplugging me
and it's your birthday
jade, i'm missing your birthday
baby girl, i'm sorry
i fucking hate when you hurt, hai
and sweeties, thank you for waiting
to open gifts
but, girls, you can just open 'em
dad ain't making it home for christmas
wish i had the strength to just blow a kiss
i go to make a fist
but i can't make one, i'm frozen stiff
i yell, but nothing comes out
i'm crying inside, i shout
my vocal cords won't permit me
i scream, but it's not aloud
you put your arm around mama
to calm her, wow
i just thought about the aisle
i'll never get to walk us down
never see you
graduate in your caps and gowns
it's 'bout to be two thousand and eight
how's this happening now?
i've got so much more to do
and proof, i'm truly sorry
if i let you down, but this tore me in two
the thought of no more me and you
you gave me shoes, nikes like new
for me for school
doody, i'm trying, but you
you were the glue that binded
so many things, time
i'd give anything to rewind it
i had to walk down my halls
and constantly be reminded
by pictures all on my walls
and i couldn't sleep at night 'cause
that image burned in my brain
of you on the table
me falling across your body
not able to stand to save you
god, why did you take him?
i'm tryna keep his legacy alive
but i'm dying, where's nathan?
little ladies, be brave
take care of your mother
smile pretty for pictures
always cherish each other
i'll always love ya
and i'll be in the back of your memory
and i know you'll never forget me
just don't get sad when remembering
and, little bro, keep making me proud
you better marry that girl
'cause she's faithfully down
and when you're exchanging those sacred vows
just know that if i could be there, i would
and should you ever see parenthood
i know you'll be good at it
oh, almost forgot to do something
thank my father too
i actually learnt a lot from you
you taught me what not to do
and mom, wish i'd have had the chance
to have one last heart-to-heart
honest and open talk to you
doody, i see you
i go to walk to you
and i can feel my soul leave my body
and float across the room
nurses lean over the bed
pulling tubes out
then the sheet over my head
shut the room down
girls, please don't get upset
i see those cheeks soaking and wet
as you squeeze hold of my neck
so forcibly, don't wanna let
me go, pillow drenched
emotional wrecks
with every second each closer to death
but suddenly, i feel my heart
begin to beat slow, then a breath
machines go (beep, beep, beep)
must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
i'm tryna rewind time like a tape
find an escape
make a beeline
try and awake
from this dream, i need to re-find
my inner strength
to remind me
even if a steep climb i must take
to rewrite a mistake
i'm rewinding the tape

(i don't want it)
i'll put out this last album, then i'm done with it
one hundred percent finished, fed up with it
i'm hanging it up, fuck it
excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
that i'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
and if things should worsen, but i bet you they won't
i'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
shred these old letters i wrote
all that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
i'm proud to be back
i'm 'bout to, like a rematch
outdo relapse
with recovery, mathers lptwo
help propel me to
victory laps
gas toward them and fast forward the past
consider the last four minutes as
that's the song i'd have sang to my daughters
if i'd have made it to the hospital
less than two hours later, but i fought it
came back like a boomerang on 'em
now a new day is dawning
i'm up, tuesday, it's morning
now i know


<i>[*plane crashing*]</i>

yeah, yo i'm just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me, 'cause i feel like i wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now

yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness
straight out the gate, i'm 'bout to break it down
ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake i'm 'bout
to rape the alphabet, i may raise some brows
if i press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)
full magazine could take staples out
savage, but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
but, bitch, i'm off the chain like kala brown

motherfucker, shut the fuck up when i'm talkin', lil' bitch
i'm sorry, wait, what's your talent?
oh, critiquin' my talent?
oh, bitch, i don't know who the fuck y'all are
to give a sub-par bar, even have an opinion or view
you mention me, millions of views, attention in news
i mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
billions of views, your ten cents are two
skim through the music to give shit reviews
to get clicks, but, bitch, you just lit the fuse
don't get misconstrued, business as us'
shit-list renewed so get shit to do
or get dissed 'cause i just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' t-to
do you have any idea how much i hate this choppy flow
everyone copies though? probably no
get this fuckin' audio out my audi yo, adios
i can see why people like lil yachty, but not me though
not even dissin', it just ain't for me
all i am simply is just an mc
maybe "stan" just isn't your cup of tea
(get it)
maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
maybe i need to stir up shit
preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
i should eat a pill, probably i will
old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
i breathe on the mirror, i don't see my breath
possibly i'm dead, i must be possessed
like an evil spell, i'm e-v-i-l (evil, but spelled)

jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
bang it with a pipe wrench
while i take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
like vice-president mike pence
back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip

these are things that i'd rather do than hear you on a mic
since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
jesus christ, man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch?
(fuck my side chick!)

you won't ever see em icy, but as cold as i get on the m-i-c
i polarize shit so the temps might freeze
and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it
bitch, i got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)

turn down for what? i ain't loud enough
nah, turn the valium up!
'cause i don't know how i'm gonna get your mouths to shut
now, when it doesn't matter what caliber i spit at
i'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
you'll turn around and just be like, "man, how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
and now he wants to take it out on us"
(ooh-ooh)

but last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
of the mathers lp to tell me to study
it'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh-ooh)
i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that
i'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
especially an effing recovery clone of me

so finger-bang, chicken wang, mgk, igg' azae'
lil pump, lil xan imitate lil wayne
i should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
i'm fed up with being humble
and rumor is i'm hungry, i'm sure you heard bumblings
i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
i heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
the era that i'm from will pummel you
that's what it's comin' to
what the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
i'm gonna crumble you and i'll take a number two
and dump on you if you ain't joyner
if you ain't kendrick or cole or sean then you're a goner
i'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper
you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonald's
but if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get revival
but y'all are acting like i tried to serve you up a slider
maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned
and you would have bought it
but sayin' i no longer got it
'cause you missed a lot and never caught it
'cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
with your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
what i'll never be is flawless, all i'll ever be is honest
even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it
even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
with a bottle full of malt liquor
but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer
the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom
if i don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
i don't see why y'all even started with me
i get in beefs, my enemies die
i don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
i'm east side, never be caught slippin'
now you see why i don't sleep
not even a wink, i don't blink
i don't doze off, i don't even nod to the beats
i don't even close my fuckin' eyes when i sneeze

"aw, man! that bet cypher was weak, it was garbage
the thing ain't even orangeâoh my god, that's a reach!"
shout to all my colorblind people, each and every one of y'all
if you call a fire engine green, aquamarine
or you think water is pink
"dawg, that's a date," "looks like an olive to me"
"look, there's an apple!" "no it's not, it's a peach!"

so finger-bang, pootie tang
burger king, gucci gang, dookie, dang
charlamagne gonna hate anyway
doesn't matter what i say
give me donkey of the day
what a way for two thousand and eighteen to get underway
but i'm gonna say everything that i wanna say
welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
invite them in like a one a day
i'm not done (preach)
'cause i feel like the beast of burden
that line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'cause the way i see people turning's
is makin' it seem worthless
it's startin' to defeat the purpose
i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
and i was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
or still yet to be determined?
'cause i'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshiped
but if i could go back i'd at least reword it
and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent
sold the dream to that he's deserted

but i think it's workin'
these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
and he's too scurred to answer me with words
'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
but i know at least he's heard it
'cause agent orange just sent the secret service
to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him
or ask if i'm linked to terrorists
i said, "only when it comes to ink and lyricists"
but my beef is more media journalists
(hold up, hold up, hold upâ¦)
i said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
can get a mouthful of flesh
and, yes, i mean eating a penis
'cause they been pannin' my album to death
so i been givin' the media fingers
don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
but they been puttin' me through the ringer
so, i ain't ironin' shit out with the press
but i just took this beat to the cleaners


motherfuckers talkin' crazy (yeah)
sayin' i should quit (ah)
i fuckin' tell 'em make me (bitch)
eat a fuckin' dick (yeah)
i'm feelin' like the greatest (woo!)
on the beat who ever did it
mike will the one who made it
it's shady on the lyrics

i'm somewhat outlandish they say
you say we're cut from the same cloth
but i guess you fabricate, eh?
you better bring more men than the latter day saints

that somethin' you won't give someone a lump in their throat
if you had them choked up you'd be yankin' my chain
feelin' like i'm headed for a padded cell
the bar for me what i rap isn't fair but
guess that's the standard i'm held to
but if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya

looked at as a failure (yeah)

lookin' for somethin' i prolly can never find now
shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
in truth a nigga just really want me tied down
i've been alone and i never needed nobody
just only me and my shotty, i'll tell these niggas to lie down
keep all the money, i never wanted the lifestyle
i just pray to god that my son'll be alright now
i said ain't no love for the other side
or anyone who ever want smoke (joyner)
when i die i'm goin' out as a underdog who never lost hope (yeah)
you in the wrong cab down the wrong path
nigga, wrong way, wrong road (woo, woo)
snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
i just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (vroom!)

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i done said a lotta things in my day, i admit it
this is payback in a way, i regret it that i did it
i done won a couple grammys, but i sold my soul to get 'em
wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
fuck's the difference?
i'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
man i used to risk it all, now i got too much to lose
i've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
i just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
fuck you think? (woo!)

i got a couple of mansions
still i don't have any manners
you got a couple of ghost writers
but to these kids it don't actually matter
they're askin' me, "what the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
i said, "i don't have any answers."
'cause i took an l when i dropped my last album
it hurt me like hell but i'm back on these rappers
and actually comin' from humble beginnings
i'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
i wish i could say, "what a wonderful feeling!"
"we're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
but nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
to even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
the inability to pen humility
ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
fuck it, i'm goin' for the jugular
shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
about the ones that were here before you that made rap
let's recap, way back, mc's that wreak havoc on tape decks
adat's, where the g raps and kanes at?
we need three stacks asap and bring masta ace back
'cause half of these rappers have brain damage
all the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
i don't hate trap, and i don't wanna seem mad
but in fact, where the old me at? the same cat
that would take that feedback and aim back, i need that
but i think it's inevitable
they know what button to press or what lever to pull
to get me to snap though (lil' bitch)
and if i pay it attention i'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
but you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
on the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
i'm asleep at the wheel again
as i peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
of another beat i'ma kill again
'cause even if i gotta end up eatin' a pill again
even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
it better be at least seventy to three hundred milligram
and i might as well 'cause i'ma end up bein' a villain again
levels to this shit, i got an elevator
you could never say to me i'm not a fuckin' record breaker
i sound like a broken record every time i break a record
nobody could ever take away the legacy i made, i never cater
motherfucker, now i got a right to be this way
i got spite inside my dna
but i wrote 'til the wheels fall off, i'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
it's the moment y'all been waitin' for
like california wishin' rain to pour
in that drought, y'all been prayin' for
my downfall from the eight mile to the southpaw
still the same marshall, that outlaw
that they say as a writer might've fell off
i'm back on that bull like the cowboy

so y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah)
<i>[joyner lucas:]</i>
y'all gotta move
give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice


yo, how do i keep
(man, i don't know what's up with these hoes, man)
gettin' in relationships like this?
(i'm just sayin')
maybe it says somethin' about me
(yeah, yup)
should i look in the mirror?

i just want you to be normal
why can't you bitches be normal?
always gotta be so extra
why you always need a lecture?
my ex hates to talk, she's a texter
even when i'm in bed layin' right next to her
wants to get back together
said not 'til she gets her act together

she thinks i'm bein' mean and now
she starts to scream and shout
she's about to let the demons out
she don't want to see me with other females out
i tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
she retaliates by tryin' to leave the house
in an evening gown with her cleavage out
we've been down this road too many times for me to count
and all i can think is howâ

i just want you to be normal
why can't you bitches be normal?
always gotta be so extra
like a fuckin' terrestrial
guess it comes with the territory
my ex girl, she just declared war
therefore, i better prepare for it
i guess bein' weird's normal

and i don't know what's got a hold of me
most notably i've been zonin' to jodeci
i'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
so much so that i bet you she don't even know that she's
the first thing i think of when i wake up
and the last thing i think of 'fore i go to sleep
sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
i know she cheats, so do i, i'm soulless, she's heartless
no wonder we're partners
both got hundreds of charges
domestic disputes but we've always
swept it under the carpet
even when nine hundred and eleven gets the call that
i slipped up and busted her jaw with
a louisville slugger 'cause alls it
really does is make our love
for each other grow stronger
she won me over the second she tried to run me over
told her i'd keep it a hun', we over
kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
but why is she so wicked?
and how the fuck did i get so twisted
up with someone so unlikeable and shifty
we're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
ignitable liquids, but i'm finally seeing
she's only mine for the time being
that's why i keep bringin' up that one time she
tried to two-time me
and throw it up in her face 'til i dry heave
how could i be so naive?
should i leave or turn this entire evening
into a motherfucking crime scene?

maybe i'm just too ugly to compete with him
you weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!
especially when you're the one cheated first
now the argument immediately becomes heated
you don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
i love you but i hope you fuckin' die though
in our business your friends like to pry so
you've got 'em all under cover just like moles
hopin' they'll come back with intel
but i'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'cause now the roles are reversed so here i go
thinkin' i'm sly as i scroll through your iphone
who the fuck's milo?
the guy at work who drives a hi-lo
i put a tracking device on your chrysler
and follow you while you drive home
but like a cyclone, i just got my disguise blown
you recognize me and had milo flip me off
right out the passenger side window
i hit a light pole, you skrt off
and then pull up at fiveam in the drive in a stretched white limo
stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with milo's demo
but like a drunk bum, what do i know?
let's sleep on it like they did revival
i told you you're the apple of my eye, so shut your pie hole

just wanna be normal
why can't you be normal? (yeah)
i just wanna be normal
why can't you be normal?


take me to the river
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

it's two thousand and two, everything was totally new
we were globally huge, watching sales go through the roof
we wrote and we feuded, runyon avenue soldiers included
a multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
we were so bulletproof wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
thought we was running shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
the death of doody broke us in two
we were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
and at the time i was going through my own struggles too
so i wasn't in no condition to be coaching us through
everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
i was hoping they do, so i ain't have to shoulder the crew
the plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
how to stand on their own, and i don't wanna open up wounds
i just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'cause the truth is, the moment that proof died, so did the group
shootâ¦

if i could leave this all behind
i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
down to the river with you
help me leave this all behind

i'ma wash away my sins
i'ma rinse away this dirt
i forgot to make amends
to all the friends i may have hurt
i better stop and say my grace
from it i pray that i don't fall
'cause on the way back down i may
end up running back into them all
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

it was never the same, and it's bothered me since
and the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
the more time goes by, the more life happens
and we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
plus we don't say how we feel
and i feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
been with you guys thick and thin
but it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
which reminded me biz, "rockstar" was the shit
y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
if you woulda put dtwelve on it, wish i coulda did
more than try talking you into coming up off of it
i know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
i think of all of the trips to bet
and the rappers i wish that we woulda politicked with
maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
but that's water under the bridge
but i'm washing my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed

if i could leave this all behind
i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
down to the river with you
help me leave this all behind

i'ma wash away my sins
i'ma rinse away this dirt
i forgot to make amends
to all the friends i may have hurt
i better stop and say my grace
from it i pray that i don't fall
'cause on the way back down i may
end up running back into them all
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

bacardi and hen', never thought the party would end
one minute you're bodying shit, but then your audience splits
you can already sense the climate is starting to shift
to these kids you no longer exist
went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
to tiny drops, little drips
and by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
you start thinking of all the artists you dissed
all the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
for turning your fucking back on bizzy, kuniva and swift?
a freudian slip, subconsciously, i honestly wished
i ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
but it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
i just wish i had words, but i guess there just are none for this
to my partners, i can't say how sorry i am
this is not how i planned for our story to end
i love all of you men
but i just can't be the guy everybody depends
on for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
i will always be here, but that spark isn't there
and i don't know how to recapture that time and that era
i've tried hearkening back to, but i'm fighting for air
i'm barely charting myself
feels like i'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
to treat y'all like a stepping stone
though i ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
done all we possibly can, i know we kept our hopes up
but the longer we spend living this lie that we live
the less is left for closure, so let's let this go
it's not goodbye to our friendship, but dtwelve is over

i'ma wash away my sins
i'ma rinse away this dirt
i forgot to make amends
to all the friends i may have hurt
i better stop and say my grace
from it i pray that i don't fall
'cause on the way back down i may
end up running back into them all
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
i never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
i never meant to use you all for my stepping stones

shit's embarrassing, as me rear-ending tara reid bare

lyrically i'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
richard ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is

somethin' evil is lurkin', i'm no conspiracy theorist

get the measuring stick (what?), twelve inches of wood
wait, but i've been goin' for your jugular since craig g duck alert
and i've come to pay respects
'cause if you sleep you're fuckedâother words, you get laid to rest
and i hope your butt is hurt
put me on a track, i go cray on it like a color book
you got some views, but you're still below me
mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
and i don't say the hook unless i wrote the hook
and now i'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
and you know i've always spoke the truth
you're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
and it ain't somethin' i need a phone to do
when i say i can't wait 'til i get ahold of you
and i don't know what i'm s'posed to do
line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot

gotta concentrate, against the clock i race
got no time to waste, i'm already late, i got a marathoner's pace
went from addict to a workaholic, word to dr. dre
in that first marijuana tapeâguess i got a chronic case (yeah)
and i ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
i know this time paul and dre
they won't tell me what not to say (nope)
and though me and my party days
have all pretty much parted ways
you'd swear to god i forgot i'm the guy that made "not afraid"
one last time for charlamagne
if my response is late, it's just how long it takes
to hit my fuckin' radar, i'm so far away
these rappers are like hunger games
one minute, they're mockin' jay
next minute, they get their style from migos or they copy drake
maybe i just don't know when to turn around and walk away
but all the hate, i call it "walk on water" gate
i've had as much as i can tolerate
i'm sick and tired of waitin', i done lost my patience
i can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
you wanted shady? you got him!

tyler create nothin', i see why you called yourself a (faggot), bitch
it's not just 'cause you lack attention
it's because you worship dtwelve's balls, you're sack-religious
if you're gonna critique me
you better at least be as good or better
get earl the hooded sweater
whatever his name is to help you put together
some words, more than just two letters

just remember, i was here before you
and i'll be here after you make your run-in for you
detractors, i might have to fuck pitchfork with a corkscrew
just what the doctor ordered
revenge is the best medicine
increase the dose, from least to most
and then tell the grammys to go and fuck themselves
they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
so they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to mc the show
every parasite needs a host (haha)
then give album of the year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
all i know is i wrote every single word of
everything i ever murdered
time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
and i got no faith in your writers, i don't believe in ghosts
when rap needed it most, i was that wing and a prayer
a beacon of hope, put a b-i-r-d in the air
somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
that's who i'm doin' it for, the rest i don't really even care
but you would think i'm carryin' a oxford dictionary in my pocket
how i'm buryin' these artists
on a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
and what's scary is you probably can compare me to your car 'cause i'm just barely gettin' started (woo)
and far as lord jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
or i'll show you an elvis clone
walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
put my feet up and just make myself at home
i belong here, clown, don't tell me 'bout the culture
i inspired the hopsins, the logics, the coles, the
seans, the k-dots, the five'nine"s, and oh
brought the world fifty cent, you did squat, piss and moan
but i'm not gonna fall... bitch!

i'm an emotional wreck, weak, everything over affects me
when you joke it upsets me, you say i'm no good at sex
and you think i'm gross and unsexy
i need scope 'cause my breath stinks
you hope that i choke on a pepsi
bitch you was supposed to correct me
been texting you since three, i still get no fucking reply
you say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
fuck you going in those knee high boots, cut it out bitch
i doubt that you're going to house sit in that outfit, and those skin-tight levi's
every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
you say "don't come over" 'cause you got pink eye
but i think i got just the thing
why don't i bring my fucking bat and just swing by

here we go again from heroes to villains
used to be your romeo but we both were jilted
a couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
but still it gave me hope that we'll get
through it together, a severed earlobe
mailed to you in an e-n-v-elope would be dope
but what kind of lengths can you go?
pull a vincent van gogh, just to convince a damn ho
to be a housewife who outright lies
she's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
i ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
she's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
guys, when someone you'd die for
sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
another late night in, she stumbles through my door
lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
and i ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers
to plant the k-y in; i'm gettin' accused by a whore
who smells like st. ides and who's probably screwed five more
guys, sucked eight/nine men
i'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
bitch it's you i tore out the frame, i win
put up a new high score, beat this game i'm in
and here's some two-ply for when you date my friends
in order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
when we renewed our vows, this the thanks i get?
i'm waitin' for the day i can
hear you say, "marshall, what a skank i've been!
and there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him"
got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
hurts me to my core, but the pain i'm in
after you, i swore to make the gray skies end
here come the rays, like when you get a pay hike and
am i the good guy or do i just play like him
and hope that he dumps you?
it's like a dream come true, just to scream "fuck you!"
guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
since

since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty
you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me
you can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever

'cause this ain't what love looks like
you can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
i ain't in my feelings, i'm out but i let you say that you're the good guy

i got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
when the world gives you a raw deal
sets you off 'til you scream, "piss off! screw you!"

i'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
patrolling corners
looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
i'm meaner in action
than rosco beating james tarteenyer (?)
and smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
i grew up in the wild hood
as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood
that i used as an excuse
and aint shit changed
but kept the same mindstate
since the third time that i failed nineth grade
you probably think that i'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
i don't promote violence i just encourage it
i laugh at the sight of death
as i fall down a cement flight of steps
and land inside a bed of spider webs
so throw caution to the wind
you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
shit, why not? blow your brain out
i'm blowing mine out
fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

it's only fair to warn
i was born with a set of horns
and metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord
warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board
that smashed into your honda accord
with a four door ford
but i'm more toward droppin an accapella
and choppin' a fella
to mozarella
worse than a hellacopta propella
got you locked in the cella
with your skeleton showing
developing anorexia
while i'm standin next to ya
eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
with an iv in your veins
feeding you liquid darvicet
pumping you full of drugs
pull the plugs
on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
who were picked up in an ambulance
and driven
to receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
and given
a less than twenty percent chance
of living
have a possible placement
it's a hospital patient
storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
doctor kevorkian has arrived
to perform an autopsy on you while you scream "i'm still alive!"
driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
and pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
better call the fire department
i've hired a arson
to set fire to carpet
and burn up your entire apartment
i'm a liar to start shit (?)
got your bitch wrapped around my dick
so tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit

met a retarded kid named greg with a wooden leg
snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
go to bed with the keg wake up with the forty
mixed up with alka seltzer and formula forty-fourd
fuck an acid tab i'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
no more said case closed end of discussion
i'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion
leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
cross the bombas (?)
we blowin up your house killing your parents 
and coming back to get your foster mommas
and i'm as good at keeping a promise as nostradamus
cause i aint making no more threats
i'm doing drivebys in tinted corvettes on vietnam war vets
i'm more or less sick in the head
maybe more cause i smoked crack (?) 
today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath
walk the block with a labrador
strapit more corral for war than el salvador
foul style galore
verbal cow manure
coming together like the eyebrow on al b. sure

subliminally, but i think criminal instinct
has pushed me to the brink, my pussy does it stink
he still loves me cause he puts me in his ink
he does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he?
nah, i'm just playing tug of war with his heart cause he misses me
i can still fuck him and leave him whenever i feel frisky
and there's no risk of disease cause he ain't with anyone is he?
this bitch really thinks she can get me
if she still wants me, driving across country
strapped him to the front seat, missing all the front teeth
thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me?
i told this cunt she's gonna over-do it once
and once she does, she'll  be stuffed up in a trunk
crunch, he scrunched her up in a ball
bunched up nice and comfy

you thought you had me, 'till my shrink told me this

i feel like a serial killer
i keep dumping bodies in the lake, imma get caught and sent up the river
i shiver when i think of the company i keep
how do i know she ain't gonna kill me when i sleep?
i shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
sex kept us together, when we slept together everything
was all better, she made me feel like a king
slowly, she began lowering my self-esteem
she go to the club and not answer the phone when i call her
and i just bought her a truck for fifty,zero dollars
accused me of doing drugs and screaming "holla"
then i find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
and all i know is every time i go
to them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow
the little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
that's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago
and i wouldn't even let on like i know
what was i supposed to do, call her out on it? we just argue
say she put it down on purpose and flipped the whole script
ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch
a cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
she thought she had me, 'till my shrink told me this

it's alright, it's ok, i'm gonna make it anyway
i'mma make it, i'mma make it, i'mma make it.., somehow

sometimes i just feel like, quitting i still might
why do i put up this fight, why do i still write
sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
sometimes i wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
and show these people what my level of skill's like
but i'm still white, sometimes i just hate life
something ain't right, hit the brake lights
case of the stage fright, drawing a blank like
da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
and i clam up (wham) i just slam shut
i just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, i have just been vicked
so i must then get off the bus then split
man fuck this shit yo, i'm going the fuck home
world on my shoulders as i run back to this eight mile road

i'm a man, i'mma make a new plan
time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
time to really just take matters into my own hands
once i'm over these tracks man i'mma never look back
(eight mile road) and i'm gone, i know right where i'm going
sorry momma i'm grown, i must travel alone
ain't gon' follow no footsteps i'm making my own
only way that i know how to escape from this eight mile road

i'm walking these train tracks, trying to regain back
the spirit i had 'fore i go back to the same crap
to the same plant, in the same pants
trying to chase rap, gotta move asap
and get a new plan, momma's got a new man
poor little baby sister, she don't understand
sits in front of the tv, buries her nose in the pad
and just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
while she colors her big brother and mother and dad
ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head
wish i could be the daddy that neither one of us had
but i keep running from something i never wanted so bad!
sometimes i get upset, 'cause i ain't blew up yet
it's like i grew up, but i ain't grow me two nuts yet
don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
the pressure's too much man, i'm just trying to do what's best
and i try, sit alone and i cry
yo i won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
that i don't pray to the sky, please i'm begging you god
please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
yo i hope you can hear me homie wherever you are
yo i'm telling you dawg i'm bailing this trailer tomorrow
tell my mother i love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
say whenever you need me baby, i'm never too far
but yo i gotta get out there, the only way i know
and i'mma be back for you, the second that i blow
on everything i own, i'll make it on my own
off to work i go, back to this eight mile road

i'm a man, gotta make a new plan
time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
time to really just take matters into my own hands
once i'm over these tracks man i'mma never look back
(eight mile road) and i'm gone, i know right where i'm going
sorry momma i'm grown, i must travel alone
ain't gon' follow no footsteps i'm making my own
only way that i know how to escape from this eight mile road

you gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
to be walking this borderline of detroit city limits
it's different, it's a certain significance
a certificate of authenticity, you'd never even see
but it's everything to me, it's my credibility
you never seen heard smelled or met a real mc
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
but yet i'm still unsigned, having a rough time
sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
go to work and serve mcs in the lunchline
but when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
who must i show, to bust my flow
where must i go, who must i know
or am i just another crab in the bucket
'cause i ain't having no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
maybe i need a new outlet, i'm starting to doubt shit
i'm feeling a little skeptical who i hang out with
i look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
at the salvation army trying to salvage an outfit
and it's cold, trying to travel this road
plus i feel like i'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
my defenses are so up, but one thing i don't want
is pity from no one, this city is no fun
there is no sun, and it's so dark
sometimes i feel like i'm just being pulled apart
from each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
it's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
sometimes i feel like a robot, sometimes i just know not
what i'm doing i just blow, my head is a stove top
i just explode, the kettle gets so hot
sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that i don't got
but i've learned, it's time for me to u-turn
yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
ain't no fallin' no next time i meet a new girl
i can no longer play stupid or be immature
i got every ingredient, all i need is the courage
like i already got the beat, all i need is the words
got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
i am no longer scared now, i'm free as a bird
then i turn and cross over the median curb
hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from eight mile road

i'm a man, gotta make a new plan
time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
time to really just take matters into my own hands
once i'm over these tracks man i'mma never look back
(eight mile road) and i'm gone, i know right where i'm going
sorry momma i'm grown, i must travel alone
ain't gon' follow no footsteps i'm making my own
only way that i know how to escape from this eight mile road

you're pac, he's pac, you're pacs: none

this guy ain't no motherfucking mc,
i know everything he's got to say against me,
i am white, i am a fucking bum,
i do live in a trailer with my mom,
my boy future is an uncle tom.
i do got a dumb friend named cheddar bob
who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun,
i did get jumped by all six of you chumps
and wink did fuck my girl,
i'm still standing here screaming, "fuck the free world!"
don't ever try to judge me, dude
you don't know what the fuck i've been through

but i know something about you
you went to cranbrook. that's a private school
what's the matter, dawg? you embarrassed?
this guy's a gangster? his real name's clarence

and clarence lives at home with both parents
and clarence's parents have a real good marriage
this guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'cause ain't no such things as half-way crooks
he's scared to death
he's scared to look
in his fucking yearbook,
fuck cranbrook

fuck a beat, i go a capella
fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer,
fuck everybody
fuck y'all if you doubt me
i'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly
and fuck this battle, i don't wanna win, i'm outty,
here, tell these people something they don't know about me.


<i>[lyckety splyt:]</i>
this guy's a choke artist, ya catch a bad one
you're better off shooting yourself with papa doc's handgun
climbing up this mountain, you're weak
i'll leave you lost without a paddle, floating shit's creek

you ain't detroit, i'm the d, you're the new kid on the block
'bout to get smacked back to the boondocks
fucking nazi, your squad ain't your type
take some real advice and form a group with vanilla ice
and what i tell you, you better use it
this guy's a hillbilly, this ain't willie nelson music

trailer trash, i'll choke you to your last breath
and have you looking foolish
like cheddar bob when he shot himself
silly rabbit, i know why they call you that
'cause you follow future like he got carrots up his ass crack
and when you acting up that's when you got jacked up
and left stupid like tina turner when she got smacked up

i'll crack your shoulder blade
you'll get dropped so hard that elvis will start turning in his grave
i don't know why they let you out in the dark
you need to take your white ass back across eight mile to the trailer park

<i>[b-rabbit:]</i>
this guy raps like his parents jerked him
he sounds like erick sermon, the generic version
this whole crowd looks suspicious
it's all dudes in here, except for these bitches
so i'm a german, eh?
that's okay, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids
these leaders of the free world rookies
lookie, how can six dicks be pussies

you're still gonna sink, you're a disgrace
yeah, they call me rabbit, this is a turtle race

he can't get with me, spitting this shit wickedly
lickety shot suspicious spickety split lickety
so i'ma turn around with a great smile
and walk my white ass back across eight mile


<i>[eminem:]</i>
guess who's back?!?!
mommy! we're home!!
say hello to my little friends
dj muggs, soul assassins, cypress hill
everybody! put your hands where my eyes can see!!!

everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
fourty fifty samoans, they knowing when d-bo was
fifty, tweezy, obie there won't be no ho in us
they pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
from new york down to texas, back up to los angeles
we've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
you may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
it's funny, i guess money does have its advantages
and it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
it's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
it's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
we just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
you fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
that you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
no one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
and they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
the noise from clips and rounds be drowned out by the crowd
and you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
till the club closes, and clears out
and that's when they see you flatened
nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping
and you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
it ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off
and it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off

shit about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
we ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
shit just ain't the same, when the aks gettin' sprayed cause
hip-hop is in a state of nine hundred and eleven
it ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
it ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
it's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
cause hip-hop is in a state of nine hundred and eleven

<i>[b-real:]</i>
step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious
all theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
thinking you coming with heat, yo son, i'm curious
how long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
we living for real and others just making the stories up
illusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
if you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
when you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none
i'm like a rolling stone homie, i got you under my thumb
silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
we cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
dealing with the giant goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon

<i>[eminem:]</i>

<i>[ganxsta ridd:]</i>
uh, gangsta ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
on this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
when i - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
my appetite for destruction is blasted because i said it
got you - stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
but you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
when you - enter the business you thinking you running shit
you witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
we gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
all these - imitators parading like they some playas
trying to - save hip-hop the task is something greater
cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
get caught, i'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
i'm riding a - gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
i'm in a - full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
on an eight mile mission with cypress and o.g.'s

<i>[eminem:]</i>

a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i was praying that you and me might end up together.
it's like wishing for rain as i stand in the desert,
but i'm holding you closer than most'cause you are my heaven.

<i>[kanye west]</i>
how you listen to a girl that still wanna man
tell me the truth is that a man or juwanna mann
i'm wonderin' why she "ret to go" like wanda then
when we met you was a v like madonna, man
now you in the field runnin' plays like donovan
mcnabb before you get in a cab
i'll trade in my cab
just to take you back to last summer, man
you don't remember when you was my sweetest
you don't remember when i called you reese's pieces
cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
she turned around and giggle said; "you so nuts!"
but nowadays we actin' way too grown up
like how ya ex girl get the new numba
the rumors was so numerous
for stickin' by me, i had to give you two thumbs up
and that's why

a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i was praying that you and me might end up together.
it's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,

<i>[eminem]</i>
so young, so full of life and vibrant,
side by side wherever you was ridin', i went,
so close almost was some bonnie and clyde shit,
when ronnie died you was right by my side,
with a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,
and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it,
you even had the same type of childhood i did,
sometimes i just wanna know why,
is it that you surcame to yours,
and mine i survived it,
you ran the streets i nine to fived it,
we grew up, grew apart as time went by us,
then i blew up to both yours and mine surprises,
now i feel the vibe i just cant describe it,
much as your pride tries to hide it,
you're cold your touch, its like ice,
and your eyes is the look of resentment,
i can sense it and i don't like it

a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i was praying that you and me might end up together.
it's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i was praying that you and me might end up together.

<i>[wiz khalifa]</i>
uh, stuck alone in this wave race
say i'm living too fast, don't plan on changing my pace
got one foot on the gas, it's never a need for brakes
smoke ez-rider's with hash, fuck bitches from out of state
valet bringing my cars, waiter bringing me plates
shrimp and fillet mignon, we celebrate buying drinks
wit a couple of broads my nigga's who got love for me
it's lonely at the top, i'm tired of having company
uh, so while you busy trying to fit in, i'm a stand out
and view my life through this lens to see how it pan's out
substitute teacher ass nigga's, need a handout
middle finger screaming fuck them nigga's who hated,
i'm money affiliated
pop another bottle, that chronic smokin degraded
speculating me landing must of got me mistaken,
i'm speaking as the captain of the planes,
you's a runner on the jet way

a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i was praying that you and me might end up together.
it's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,

i stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
they call me slim roethlisberger
i go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
a merk her with a mossberg
i'm pissed off get murdered
like someone took a ketchup squirter
squirted a frankfurter
for a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
when you saw the chainsaw get to waving
like a terrible towel
i faced her around
but his fangs come out
get your brains blown out
that's what i call blowing your mind
when i come back
like nut on your spine
i'm a thumb tack
that you slept on son
now here i come screaming attack like i just stepped on one
low on the totem till he showed 'em
defiance, giant scrotum
he don't owe them bitches shit
his bridges, he out grow'd em

<i>[taylor]</i>
come on, come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted

come on, come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breath whenever you gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted

i'm back for revenge
i lost a battle that ain't happening again
i'm at your throat like strep
i step, strapped with a pen
metaphors wrote on my hand,
someone distorted my mint
read some i wrote on a napkin
i do what i have to to win
pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
not even austin powers, how the fuck are they mike meyers
and tell that psycho to pass the torch
to the whack before i take a shit in his jack-o-lantern
and smash it on his porch
now get off my dick
dick's too short a word for my dick
get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick
you call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
i just blew up the challenger, matter fact i need a lawyer
i displaced my clause with enough plaster
to make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
you're the eminem backwards, you're mini-me
see he's in a whole nother weight class
he smokes your bb's you beat back bullets
you're full of it; you were just in his cd's
left at infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
no peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
his new slim shady ep's got the attention of the mighty d. r. e

i'm haunted i'm dead your gone

come on, come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
won't finish what you started

come on, come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breath whenever you gone
can't go back, i'm haunted

oooooh

you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
never ever thought i'd see it break.
never thought i'd see it


<i>[eminem]</i>
hi!
original bad boy on the case, cover your face
came in the place blowed, and sprayed puffy with mase
i laced the weed with insect repellent, better check the smelly
eminem starts with e, better check the spelling
with a capital, somebody grab me a snapple
i got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple (hurry up!)
somebody dropped me on my head, and i was sure
that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
i slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
and said, "i'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?"
the world ain't ready for me yet, i can tell
i'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
i'm sicker than sperm cells with syphillis germs
and i'm hotter than my dick is, when i piss and it burns
i kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it (yuck!)
(yuck!) hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
if y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it
and all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it
cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, i don't feel it

<i>[chorus (eminem):]</i>
cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? ha?
is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi!
cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me?
is fuckin crazy

<i>[eminem]</i>
i'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin
i'm eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
i'm slim, the shady is really a fake alias
to save me with in case i get chased by space aliens
a brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
than a maniac saudi arabian
a highly combustible head, spazmatic
strapped to a kraftmatic adjustable bed
laid up in the hospital in critical condition
i flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
high speed, iv full of thai weed
lookin chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
i hope god forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends
on if i keep on killin my girlfriends

cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? ha?
is fuckin crazy -- listen!!
cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me?
is fuckin crazy

<i>[eminem]</i>
last night i o.d.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(shucks!) i'm an alcoholic and that's all i can say
i call in to work, cause all i do is frolic and play
i swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
of tylenol three, and talk about how violent i'll be (rrarrrrh)
give me eleven excederin my head'll spin
medicine'll get me revvin like a seven hundred and forty-seven jet engine
scratched my balls til i shredded skin
"doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"
"it's probably aids!" forget it then
i strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos
so reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
and pick up this slim shady shit that's on rawkus
somethin somethin somethin, somethin i get weeded
my daughter scribbled over that rhyme, i couldn't read it
damn!

<i>[chorus (eminem)]</i>

something's not right
i'm sorry,

the wild.. gotham
the wild.. west <i>[*bang bang, bang*]</i>
ha ha, ride..

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
all you see is the sun, reflecting off of the gun
i'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
i'm gonna show you how real cowboys get down
i'm polishing gold, waiting for this drama to unfold
i got a {blunt} rolled
feelin bold, gangsters blood runs cold
it's time to reload this old .forty-five colt
the wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
bust a couple shots, make sure i'm not rusty
it's passed noon, he should be here soon
sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
all of a sudden i can hear the sound of hoofs
sounds like a thousand wolves
i cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
i pose like a poster, he's closer than close
i hold the heat sturdy, i heard he fight's dirty
but i'm gonna put thirty inside him and leave early
and just when i went to fill him with hot lead
i put the gun to his head, and this is what he said

<i>[eminem]</i>
you never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
but i know you - the name's slim - you want revenge?
then don't shoot, i'm in the same boots as you
i'm telling the truth, i got a price on my head too, cause when you..

you ride like a cowboy toward the sun
and life ain't fun, when you're on the run
got your gold and you got your gun
but life as an outlaw just begun
got your shotgun by your side
got your horse and you got your pride
you ride til there ain't no place to hide
it's sad cause the bad guys always die

<i>[dr. dre + eminem]</i>
he was "shady," i seen by the look on his face
he said take ten paces {shit} i took eight
spun around and i aimed straight for the brain
my {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
(you need bullets, hurry up run!) <i>[*imitating slick rick*]</i>
i put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
we both drew at the same time and stood stunned
(go ahead, shoot me, but i'm not the one you want)
i figured he was telling the truth, that's why i didn't shoot
so what we gonna do, it's on you
(do you recall when you and snoop was a group?)
the chronic!
(well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
(and plus i know who's got it)
who?
(some old dude, he's got twenty-six plaques and he already sold two)
loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
we rolled two miles until we hit the spot
an old ghost town that everybody forgot
a place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
slim grabbed the shotgun (dre here's the plot)

<i>[eminem]</i>
this is the spot, they call him doc loveless
he's going around saying he took the game from us
(let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it coming)
but he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
he's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
our mission - is to get him to stop laying eggs
and we can put him on his back down a flight of steps

<i>[dr. dre]</i>
i drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
kicked the swinging doors in, started gun slinging
i could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a "g thang,"
and a verse from "keep their heads ringing"
i said "it's dre's day," and started to spray
against one thousand, eight hundred, he pulls a ak
hollow tips started flying every which way

<i>[eminem]</i>
that's when i seen dre in trouble and came with the gauge
i fired the first shot, spun his body around
he hit the ground and landed upside down
dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
i grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled

<i>[chorus twox]</i>

always die..

cause i'ma still be madd rapper, whether i got money or not {yup}
as long as i'm on pills, and i got plenty of pot
i'll be in a canoe paddlin, makin fun of your yacht
but i would like an award 
for the best rapper to get one mic in the source
and a wardrobe i can afford
otherwise i might get sent up back-strike in a ford
and you wonder what the fuck i need more vicadin for
everybody's pissin' me off; even the no limit tank 
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off

i grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood, that i used as an excuse
and ain't shit changed, i kept the same mindstate
since the third time that i failed nineth grade
you probably think that i'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
i don't promote violence, i just encourage it {c'mon}
i laugh at the sight of death
as i fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}
and land inside a bed of spider webs
so throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
shit, why not, blow your brain out, i'm blowin mine out

my laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist
make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face 
and place the clip and cock it back
and let it go until your brains are rippin out 
your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
i'm not a "role model," i don't wanna babysit kids
i got one little girl, and hailey jade is shady's business
and shady's just an alias i made to make you pissed off
where the fuck were you when gil was paid to make me dishwash?
i make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
you made me get a bigger attitude than eighty kim scott's
and she almost got the same fate that grady's bitch got
i knew that "just the two of us" would make you hate me this much
and "just the two of us," that ain't got shit to do with us 
and our personal life, it's just words on a mic
so you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
but the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch!

<i>[chorus two]</i>


<i>[eminem:]</i>
welcome to detroit
this is the bet shady two.zero cypher two thousand and eleven
myself, slaughterhouse and yelawolf

white dog, get em!

<i>[yelawolf:]</i>
put these muthafuckas in a box and i send âem away
put 'em in a gray 'lac and pop the trunk
hey throw 'em in the back, jack, i dig âem a grave
put a brick inside that xerox, when i print âem a page
moving keys i can't relate, cause i live in a cage
i throw up the a, i take âem to school,
i give em a grade, an easy e for effort
that's wwa, white with an attitude
alphabet soup is on my plate
all i got is zâs they sleeping on me, i canât get âem awake
i spoon feed them the sound in a room full of deceivers and clowns
who believe they making it rain cause all they see is the clouds
and i watch from the couch of the vip
like a potato with a bunch of meatheads like fuck it
i just feed em a cow
plenty of white boys to pick from this year
but before you can pick a pepper, you better pick up your heater
cause even peter piper could pick up a mic
but what it's like to pick a fight with me
itâs like putting nikes on a cheetah, betta speed up
or at least in my case addidas
i'm out this bitch drinking sprite by the two liter
holler, shady records

<i>[joe budden:]</i>
say iâm from the new school, iâma say check ya tone and watch ya mouth
if they teaching how to dougie, iâm condoning dropping out
forced to wile, y'all birthed and gave me up
i just perfected being hip hops foster child, now check it
i donât blame yâall for being trash fans and copping it
the radioâs the crime scene the masses are the hostages
in my youth i'd throw shots, the fan would dodging it
iâm grown, i ain't watching the throne, iâm sabotaging it
you see that four headed monster and the storm looms
snipe âem from a distance, the scope got a long zoom
you super mario thugs is in the wrong room
got a figure here you wonât get bigger if you on shrooms
was left to me i'd revive what the game be âbout
iâda took the wine outta amy house
enough raps from you scrub cats about cocking a snub back
wayne couldnât teach me how to love that
but i got this shit from uptown, she my summer bunny
both parents broke but she comes from money
think my bread is her paper to burn
so i lock her out and now she doubt david is stern
she so bad i make her hit the telly from a taxi
then dead her in that holiday inn
learnt that from max b
that's why the haters of every kind wanna send me llamas
i made it right before they eyes like i was benihanas
is it me? or is what i'm hearing just pitiful?
airwaves the same now the stereoâs typical
my skin thick so the critics ignore
so unafraid to die you think i did it before
the boys rodman with the trash talk
magical walk with the black ball way i bounce off the asphalt with cat paws
glass jaw, hoody and mask would be the black folk with no passport
body be found in the mansion in one of my trap doors
if pumps had awards ya status whore category
probably be that of awards 'tween michael rappaport and kenny lattimore
i know hip hops alive and well
if it died, you other crews wouldnât survive the smell

(ladies &amp; gentlemen... you're scared now)
(make that face at 'em dawg)
(crooked i.. get 'em)

<i>[crooked i:]</i>
i spot a victim, the plotâll thicken when the clock is tickin'
i caught em slippin', i gotta give em a shot, i hit em with proper spittin'
hottest writtens and compositions, so competition's a contradiction
somebody mentioned they got it crooked, highly fiction,
we probably different, got gotti henchmen,
opposition our body quick as bugatti engines
iâm on a mission to get richer,
the sickest lyric kicker diggin' a ditch for different spitters
sweet lyricists get disfigured, sip liquor
spit like a sick mixture
of notorious pun and l get the big picture
the poster iâll roast ya,
my mind so deadly itâs just like the beanie is close to a holster
itâs over control my whole coastal region like iâm supposed to
flow is going postal evening, open season
heart close to freezing, ruthless is easy nigga
approach iâm squeezing, believe me
dopest west coaster  breathing
so most y'all hope iâm vegan, no pun, beefing
rappers need to keep it trill
give me a beat to kill too many people still eating sleeping pills
people sleeping on my ether skills
and y'all ain't even real
we about to die in this cypher
before you die you should do the jada and leave a will
foreal

<i>[joeel ortiz:]</i>
yaooowa
i ain't a rap dude, iâm a dude who rap
before this i was moving crack
killers yâall become when yâall rhyme, i salute and dap
and if i blink then remove ya snaps, you ain't cool you wack
with ya foolish yacâs? skinny jeans don't mean ya ass shoot
it means ya booty claps
donât play like tyler perry, this the slaughterhouse of pain
flow brown, tight and heavy
when it comes to sixteenâs iâm a fiend feinding a studio
near a needle with a mean lean, probably writing bars to nas "thief theme"
getting my yaowa on, may all the olajuwonâs be the dream team
this is an all day slaughter
they feindin for us to break like beyonceâs water
the four quarters doing all the eating
and you gotta know why i made the cut, iâm puerto rican
ortiz keep the fire ready
and tryna put me outâs like tryna steal a transvestite from eddie

<i>[royce da five'nine':]</i>
iâm do or die dope
and you can make the sticker sittin' on the door
of that phantom your suicide note
hi rihanna..
is nicki living with you? let me know
so i can buy binoculars and telescopes
hi rihanna..
i donât need to know you better
you tell me you love my music again, we go together
bye rihanna...
now back to yâall fools
we rock out like the outside of a guitar school
thousand dollar frames, i prefer to see the world through
donât ask me nothing bout budden, i beat my girl too
you ask me why do i keep her? i say itâs cheaper to
thatâs why i ride around in a rolls like wiz khalifa do
rappers, iâm your daddy, i tell you straight as this
you donât kill but your father will like jaden smith
i tell ya like i tell my spanish chick
you fly but i ainât going down on no landing strip
so get your wax on like daniel-son
or iâma have to run like de la hoya in drag when cameras come
point out the greatest rapper alive i headshot âem
smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom
bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
while iâm cyber sexing with jessica alba, via skype
iâm on my d-boy, d-bo thing
spiritual steelo swing like cee-lo green
get out the camera with yo b roll bling
you know your flow is whack
we cornered the market like a wal-mart in a cul-de-sac
yeah, this what two million singles sold and a album thatâs gold
look like, without having to sell your soul
nickle

<i>[eminem:]</i>
wait, can i rap?

(you da boss, you better get 'em)

ayo... lyrical miracle spiritual individual criminal subliminal
in your swimmin' pool

(boo.. come on man, get back on.. kick that shit)

you âbout to see peace destroyed
itâll never be restored
when i unleash these beastly hoards on your cd stores
wanna stop it, you gon' need a priest and at least three swords
a license to ill from the beastie boys, three ouija boards
and a squeegee and please be warned donât ask for the squeegees for
or the holy water, acid rap thatâll eat these floors
eat a hole in a rhyme book, you see these horns?
and as for me, you ask when iâm gone "will he be mourned?"
is puke luke warm? should casey anthony do porn?
can that chick fit a newborn dead baby inside a freakin' shoebox
with a shoehorn, smothered in chloroform so she can go get her groove on?
can she duct tape and velcro a fetus? joell yo,
tell joe i need his empty box from his old shell toe adidas
so i can put these babies in the fetal position,
theyâre getting elbows to the penis
yeah, big deal. i took some little kids big wheel
and spit in his fricken big kids meal
quit tryna bite me and pinch, you wench, sit still
you just put your six inch heel through my benz windshield?
is it dust we bout to kick up?
can yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup?
between a stick shift in his fricken pick up
and drink like a hick, redneck, hillbilly will till he gets hiccups?
flippin' the script up like mike vick
get bit in his junk by a pit, yup iâm a sick pup
iâd be a horrible magician
cause iâd fuck that trick up
fix ya lips up to say something fly, or zip up
a-b? letâs c. you said you were gonna do x-y-z
till you fuck around and get dropped like an e
when you add an i-n-g
donât put a k in front of that though, when i mc
cause iâm not the king of this microphone booth
itâs more like a phonebooth
superman in this bitch, kryptonite wonât do
it gives me more power, i bump the fat boys and
eat rat poison, take meteor showers
fresh outta the mental hospital and me not flossing a middle finger
while i hop in a mosh pit, will be like nas doing gospel or r&amp;b, you crazy?
me pushing up daisies? that thought is impossible
as if flashing across the news, posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
with a huge johnson, boobs, and a monstrous tube of lube
and a bra, some boots, some panties, in an aqua blue mazda
swallowing a popsicle, playing tonsil pool
so kill the rumors it ainât happenin'
iâma rap till iâm fossil fuel


<i>[dj scratching:]</i> "do it!" 

<i>[eminem:]</i> 
sneakin in through the back door, fruity mc's get ambushed 
rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed 
then i'm movin on down from the right to left 
so bite the meth or prepare to fight to death 
to get jacked, attacked and cracked in two 
smackin through 'til youre black and blue for actin true 
i'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands 
proof that i be sniffin on aerosol cans 
i'm stompin, i'm kickin, i'm chokin, i'm stampin em 
clompin em, stickin, and pokin and clampin em 
to electric chairs and tightenin bolts 
hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts 
i'm zappin, rappers, singers, and dancers 
faster than you could snap your fingers for ransom 
cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathin 
survivin by connivin and theivin 

<i>[dj scratching:]</i> "do it!", "eat em up" 

<i>[eminem:]</i> 
i had a dream i was gettin jacked by biters 
it felt like i was bein attacked by spiders 
developin a fear of biterphobia 
i'm holdin a gas can and lighter over ya 
if i detect ya, i'ma pulverize 
dissect your brain, diggin in your skull for lies 
and i'ma torture, with material iller 
than a stark ravin mad serial killer 
i'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is 
a major risk to a plagiarist 
so beware of the aura, a terror for the horrible 
will scare ya tomorrow, is the airbourne assault of the rappers 
hit the source to better my skills, 
i head for the border 
and run the galloping hills, the choice is yours 
cause now buddy's noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse 
cause i'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage yours to bite like labradors 
in the range of my double-barrel 
and your life is in danger, trouble, and peril 

<i>[dj scratching]</i> 

<i>[eminem:]</i> 
i trample and stamp liars, like they were campfires 
cuz vampires right on my balls like clamp pliers 
and swing on my big thingamajig 
so i'm bringin my nig proof for backup when i sing at my gig 
cause biters are fallin head over heels 
in love with every rhyme that i've said over reels 
that's how i became paranoid 
chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed 
cause every time you bit it was deliberate 
so i'm forced to hit a little quicker with 
an ultimatum i assault and slayed em 
with rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em 
energetic and imaginative, 
pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives 
will reach out and grab ya, nine times outta ten 
that's why i'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen 

<i>[dj scratching:]</i> "everybody walk out the back door"

boy meets girl
you were my dream my world
but i was blind
you cheated on me from behind

'cause boy meets girl
you were my dream my world
but i was blind
you cheated on me from behind

<i>[verse one - eminem]</i>
now i know we said things
did things that we didn't mean
and we fall back into the same patterns
same teams
but your tempers' shit just bad as mine
you're same as me
but when it comes to love you just as blinded

baby please come back
it wasn't you
maybe it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much
to walk away doe

come inside
pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk?
told you "this is my fault"
look me in the eyeball
next time i'll miss to let my fist hit the dry wall
next time
there won't be no next time
i apologize even though i know it's lies
i'm tired of the games
i just want it back
i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fucking leave again
ima tie her to the bed
and set her house on fire

boy meets girl
you were my dream my world
but i was blind
you cheated on me from behind

'cause boy meets girl
you were my dream my world
but i was blind
you cheated on me from behind

<i>[bow wow:]</i>

i'm sitting lookin out the window like, "damn"
tryna fix the situation that's at hand
you're still running through my mind when i'm knowing that you shouldn't be
me, you're gonna be mine when i'm knowing that you couldn't be

cuz you haven't called
i ain't even appalled
i still got a lot of pain
i ain't dealt with it all
i've been runnin around with other chicks
i'm single and they lovin it
i'm likin it but i just want the one that i was in love with

it's not the end of it
i'm tryna let you go
i can't
get a grip of that i'm tryna let you know

you got hold some kind of control of me
i don't know what it is
but i gotta get you goin for me

i'm working at it

i'm just tryna be like
"yeah, whatever, forget it."
instead of starin out this glass
lookin at this bad weather
damn, i gotta pull myself together
cuz

boy meets girl
you were my dream my world
but i was blind
you cheated on me from behind

'cause boy meets girl
you were my dream my world
but i was blind
you cheated on me from behind

<i>[drake:]</i>
it sounds like a conversation
it's a celebration
lets toast to the fact i moved out my mamas basement
to a condo downtown
cuz it's all about location
i sit and drink wine and watch californication of life
you shoulda been here to kick it with me
we coulda split this whole thing up fifty/fifty
but now i'm at the forty/forty gettin bitches tipsy
killin shit that ever so talented mr. riply

how did i go from bein a man that you argued with?
to meeting dwayne carter and putting alcohol an shit
should wanna go back to the one i started with
but i'm addicted to this life
it's gonna be hard to quit

yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
you can tell me that you've none of my songs
as long as you say one day you plan to listen
cuz what's a star when its most important fans are missing

boy meets girl
you were my dream my world
but i was blind
you cheated on me from behind

'cause boy meets girl
you were my dream my world
but i was blind
you cheated on me from behind

marshall, sounds like an sos...

holy wack, unlyrical lyrics andre, you're fuckin' right...

to the rapmobile, let's go...

{marshall, marshall}, bitches and gentlemen, it's showtime, hurry hurry, step right up,
introducing the star of our show, his name is, {marshall}, you wouldn't want to be anywhere else
in the world right now, so without further ado, i bring to you, {marshall}...

you 'bout to witness hip-hop in it's most purest, more rawest form, flow almost flawless, most
hardest, most honest known artist, chip off the old block, but ol' doc is, {back}, looks like
batman brought his own robin, oh god, sadam's got his own laden, with his own private plane, his
own pilot, set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges, oranges, peach, pears, plums,
syringes, {vnn vnn}, yeah here i come, i'm inches, away from you, dear fear none, hip-hop is in
a state of nine hundred and eleven, so...

so skip to your lou while i do what i do best, you ain't even impressed no more, you're used to
it, flows too wet, nobody close to it, nobody says it, but still everybody knows the shit, the
most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all
so much, they make it all up, there's no such thing, like a female with good looks, who cooks
and cleans, it just means so much more to so much more people when you're rappin' and you know
what for, the show must go on, so i'd like to welcome y'all to marshall and andre's carnival,
c'mon now...

<i>[chorus]</i>

you can
even call collect, the most feared duet, since me and elton played career russian roulette, and
never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat, people steppin' over people just to rush to
the set, just to get to see an mc who breathes so freely, ease over these beat's and be so
breezy, jesus how can shit be so easy, how can one chandra be so levy, turn on these beats,
mc's don't see me, believe me bet and mtv are gonna grieve, when we leave, dog fo' sheezy,
can't leave rap alone, the game needs me, 'till we grow beards, get weird, and disappear into
the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here, but we ain't fuckin around round here, yo' dre,
what up, can i get a hell, hell yeah, now...

<i>[chorus]</i>

so there you have it folks, {marshall}, has come to save the day, back with his friend andre,
and to remind you that bullshit does not pay, because, {marshall}, and andre are here to stay
and never go away until our dying day until we're old and grey, {marshall}, so until next time
friends, same blonde hair, same rap channel, good night everyone, thank you for coming, your
host for the evening, {marshall}, oh, ha...


jumped out of the twond floor of a record store
with a treacherous four cassette and a cassette recorder
in ecuador with edward norton
witness the metamorphosis
of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
from the hessian war and
hence the origin of the headless horseman
born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
endless source and reservoir
of extension cords in dresser drawers
and deadbolts on the bedroom doors
and sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
excellent boyfriend

use intercourse to settle scores
with women who have been vendettas towards men
dickhead is forced in 'til there's shredded foreskin
reddish torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
bed sores and sore shins
pregnant whores can get abortions
fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption
skeletor, i went to hell and fell a floor
a predator, i'm headed for competitors
better warn 'em, what i lack in tact and a set of morals
i make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
stegosaurus, chuck norris with a thesaurus
yes, of course, a mess of warrants
you want some? come and get some, boys!
i'm givin' daniel pantaleo a refresher course
on excessive force and pressure points
and dressin' george zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
dress and four inch heels to address the court
with a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso
or left on the doorsteps of trayvon's dad as a present for him

in my present form i'm desert storm
appetite for destruction there's no suppressant for
aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
the rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
met a contortionist, said, "when you wanna get sexual?"
she said, "however i fit in your schedule. i'm flexible."
expired tags on the saturn, got catherine bach
in the back in daisy dukes with the hazards on
at a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
for this asshole cop's daughter
laugh 'cause i called her a brat on it
he spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
had a heart attack and dropped dead
started fallin' back with it
and got slapped with a colin kaepernick practice sock

one ball and half a dick, apple watch
crack front axle, walked in a bass pro shop with david hasselhoff, pulled tabasco sauce out of my satchel
knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*
asked if they had a laughin' stock
that was fuckin' stupidâ¦

you got it twisted, all 'cause i offered this bitch
a doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
bitch, get to massagin' this dick!
like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
it's not a bitch on this earth i can be monogamous with
she's non-existent
robin thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit
but i shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
misfit, blond and nitwit
like i've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
screamed, "i hate blondes," and became one, i'm optimistic
love to start shit
shovin' clark kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
of the bucket, bumpin' bubba sparxxx
i'm double parkin' up at targets, trouble 'causer, a double crosser
shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
a couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
same damn brain scan results as rainman's is
something's off, but when dustin hoffman's
dressin' up in your mummy costume
on stage dancin' to "brain damage," what's the problem?
nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
run the faucet, i'ma dunk
a bunch of trump supporters underwater
snuck up on 'em in ray bans in a gray van with a spray tan
it's a wrap, like an ace bandage
don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last dna strand
e&amp;j in the waistband, at the vmas with the stagehand
she wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan
three-inch blade on point, like a see-and-say
consider me a dangerous man
but you should be afraid of this dang candidate
you say trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
and that's what you wanted
a fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
who doesn't have to answer to no oneâgreat idea!

if i was president
gettin' off is the first order of business
once i get in office
second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to uncle sam
naked, laughin', dick cupped in hand
screamin', "fuck safe sex!"
throw a latex and an aids test at him
tell congress i run this land
and i want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
addiction to friction and static
addict who can't escape the habit
continue to chase the dragon
but as fate would have it, i walked up in major magics
dressed as the maintenance man
in a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
with a gauge to blast it
and sped away in the station wagon
stacey dash's and casey anthony's
crazy asses in the backseat
throwin' stayfree pads at me
dead passenger in the passenger seat
unfasten the safety latches
and slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
i snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
'finna get a murder case and catch it
like you threw it at me encased in plastic

and send dylan roof through the windshield of the benz
until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin'
and skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
swing for the fence like prince fielder
knock it into the upper peninsula
you wanna go against 'zilla? the rap god
when will i quit? never been realer
the in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
whose pens iller than prince in a chinchilla
or ben stiller in a suspense thriller
revenge killer, avenge syllable binge
fill a syringe, 'til i
draw first blood
even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
couldn't be more awkwarder
cause you're innocence i robbed you of
it's my fingers that got stuck up
taught ya ta, not give a
slapstick, hockey puck
the broad hunter with the sawed off
like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
but i'm not gonna, get the shotgun
or the glock, i'm gonna opt for the ox
cause i'm into objects that are sharp when i shop
and it's not a shock, i'm such an obnoxious fucker
the rock hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought
this much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of vivica fox with a box cutter
that was for fifty, little slap on the wrist be warned
i'm unrevealin' quickly
my squabbles, i'm grappling with your time traveling with me
try and follow, as i wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
tip it back then i'm twisting wine bottles
like what happened to chris reeves' spine column
that's the plan of attack when i'm fixing my problems
wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
but the fact that i have so many rappers against me mind boggles
and why i haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is
more of a spectacular mystery than a fucking agatha christie crime novel

but my patience is wearing thin
swear i been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til i smear it in
diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
and never appear again
if you actually had fuckin' careers to end
but then i think of molly qerim and i steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
molly, i'm gone off you
man, light some kush
you're my first take, i'll nail you
can't lie, i gush
if i won you over, you would be the grand prize
i'm entranced by your looks, come and give the shady franchise a push
you can get it in the can like some anheuser busch
jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
mushed against your damn side, your puss
and thighs are squished
what kind of attires that?
i'm ready to be rode
psychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat
light the match to ignite the wrath
got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
piper chapmans might just have to picket me
like a scab
hard to describe in fact
startling violent perhaps
are things that come to mind as soon as i start spitting rhymes like that
and you aren't really surprised at that
but as far as these lines i rap
and these bars, wouldn't dial it back if i star sixty-nineed the track

why am i such a dick?

how many fuckin' rappers did i go through?
dispel doubt, but you won't admit i smoked
and you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit
but am i s'posed to sound like everything else out?
'cause i don't get compared to it, only myself now
and i can see the fair-weather fans and sales down

rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
how did anybody ever find me, i disap-
-peared i was hiding in freeway's beard, just a
hop skip and a jump from my skin, gushing
nails into my face that i been pushing
hell-raiser, my face is my pincushion

sucker like a vice-grip, my pen put ya

and hind sight should never left when i was living,
and probably wouldn't be getting pressed by all these women,
and then again, i wouldn't rap the ones i was diggin'
so annihilate the looking, and talking alot about the hood; kim'n, kim'n,
uh, so selena williams, just like my dad talks about more john dick'n,
this girl talkin' how she pregrent, she crazy, so later i crushed that hoe, and left baby,
and never trust her, no shit! even she specialize in massaging on my testicles, 
and i never trust her, a whole lot, even on the first date, she basically get her mouth rimmed,
and turn around and ask me for a kiss, no bitch i'm straight, 
and i never really get concerned how my own dick tastes,
i think i'm about to slip on my swag juice,

ha, so do i. at least i thought i did.

<i>[jazmine sullivan]</i>
got to have it
yeah, i made it
iâm addicted
yeah, iâm feigning

<i>[eminem - verse one]</i>
this is a beat with no words at first
it's a blank painting
exercising the mind is brain strength training
starts off with something, like shady's an insane maniac,
yeah, slim shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?
now all you need's an image to go with the name, baby
wife beaters and white t-shirts, hanes mainly
it's a long shot, but is it possible there's a lane, maybe?
if not, he's gonna have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
he wants the fame so bad he can taste it
he could see his name up in lights
women screaming his fuckinâ name, fainting
shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
joe schmoe made it, he took his plain jane lady and his baby hailie out the trailer
but he ainât trailing anymore, heâs ahead of the race
while maintaining his innocence
little does he know, his train is derailing
and heâs about to be raped by this game anally

<i>[jazmine sullivan - hook]</i>
what would you do for a little bit?
what would you give for a little hit?
for that c.o.c.a.i.n.e.
'cause once you get in, you don't wanna leave

got to have it
yeah, i made it
i'm addicted
yeah, i'm feigning

<i>[eminem - verse two]</i>
youâre operating on all cylinders
syllables spit like dillingerâs spilling ya guts
people are feeling ya mic skills, but these haters are ice grillinâ ya
willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
fake friendsâll kill for ya, die for ya
but you canât decipher âwhy?â for the life of ya
it wasnât like this when you were cypherinâ
argue witâ your wife again
she found vicodin in your pants last night again
your disputeâs public, nothing is private anymore
oh, and your best friend? say bye-bye to him
what kinda apple you take a biteâa, slim?
(this is what you wanted marshall, ainât it?)
fuck no!
the way that it turned out was nothinâ like the picture that i painted in my head
sometimes a dream to make it, itâs more fun than it is to actually make it
the game stripped me naked
it robbed me ever having another real relation-
-ship, with another girl
this world is a fuckinâ trip
âcause i slip in another world, proceed, take another hit
sniff âtil i fuckinâ hurl, tell âem all to fuckinâ sit
and spin âtil they fuckinâ twirl, middle finger up again
relapsing back in this game
oh well, fuck it, then

start off right
just to see your name in lights
just so you can live the life
you take a bite
and lose your sight
they call this (fame)

you think you good (ha ha)
just cause you got out the hood
concerned only with getting dough,
no longer poor but lost your soul they call this.. (fame)

i hear it callin'
my name is callin'
why you strugglin'
when you could be ballin'
my head is sayin' yeah
but my feet is stallin'
so many walk in
but any fallin'
but i got to have it
like eve and the apple
she had to grab it
i got to take it
i got to make it
that's the plan
and i can't forsake it.

in my mind i'ma fighter, my heart's a lighter
my soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
arsenic writer, author with arthritis
carpel tunnel, marshall will start shit-itis
hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed
dick headed, a prick, a big headache i'm sick
quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are six critics.
who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
this dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
some lunatic lit it and it's not nelly
do not tell me to stop yelling, when i stop selling i quit
so stop dwelling an i am not felling
you fuckers are not ready, cause i got jelly, like beyonce's pot belly
this is destiny, yes money i'm of running
so get off of me, i'm not slowing or softening

<i>[chorus]</i>


"other man!"

i stand in slapped by the wind as i begin
do you know who i am? and many reply with a grin
yes, i'm tired of being obtruded
why should i be secluded? i've got a brand new horn to be tooted
to sum it up in a nutshell, "eminem will you kick it for me?"
so i find myself in a certain obligatory
a place that i dwell in, fell into some wonderful productions
to make up for lost time, and then it brings obstruction
finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
a mental projectile, i aim at the reptile
i look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
"why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?"
is there a reason for this? the hindrance is aggravating
how many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
there's so much more to learn and pages left to be read
so put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
while i hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty thor
words can weigh a ton
therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one

"yeah", "it's another"

very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side
but i see no borderline, from under this colorblind
and some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred
but then i'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
wrong, the world would never endure to arguing
awaking to the absence of unity is startling
"oh foolish pride, what the hell are you trying to do?
you cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to"
your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable
so how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
you're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless
damn, you're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this
straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
the date of my birth on the earth, the deliverance of a starchild
blessed with formidable talent and versatility
but with such a power, there comes a responsibility
to infringe on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear
to form an alliance is something even the giants fear
so instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
refusal of usin' is accepted now it's a trend

"yeah", "it's another..."

you know i don't understand why we all just can't get along
you hate me but you know me and what i stand for
no. so then why do you speak for me
and every other white man when you that we're your enemy?

on the floor lies a broken door, cause i'm not to be spoken for
stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
rarely do you see the lighter side of me
i try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
but <i>[?]</i> is isolated, apologies are exhausted
feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
who can i trust after repeatedly being shafted
switch to the opposite, now scenes are being re-enacted
pull up that boy by his roots, destroy him quick
his fracture's obviating, we hate him, his patterns past us, huh
always fighting for the position of top dog
that spot's already occupied, and i don't play leapfrog
cause i do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
but i'm always having to prove myself, time after time
oh how i never understand how a man could be outcast
judged from the past and he's put last
and others with nothing to say
stutterin' and slurrin' and mutterin' words with no meaning attack be signin' like danny kaye
here i go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
and eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
i've got a craving


yo, alright, yo
i'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while i'm sleeping
i keep dreaming of death and i'm hearing people screaming
the devil's spirit's trapped inside me and i want it out
i'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
with both of my wrists slit, i'm lifted up in the air
and suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
i feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death
but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
tripping over od'd bodies of dead lushes
bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
door's open and close by themselves, books fly off shelves
curtains catch fire, the house melts
my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
caught a piece of shrapnel in the adam's apple
two cups of holy water and i'm looking at 'em half full
but as soon as i go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
it got silent, then all these voices said
"come follow me into the pits of hell"
i heard 'em yell "welcome to the norman bates motel!"
i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother
covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
i said i need a room so i could try to get some rest
she gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
and told me that's just for starters, satan'll be in to see me later
to see if i'm interested in being partners


fuck an intro man, let's go.

i come around like what goes around
what goes up must come down
anyone who comes up must go down
might as well go for the gusto now
better not let up, better not let them breathe
last shot give it all you got
try to turn me down bitch get fucked with a volume knob, fuck all you snobs
hoes i hope all you rot
two bottles of lubriderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought?
and you wanna menage a trois you twats
fuck that i'd rather turn this club to a bar room brawl
get as rowdy as roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
like a leech stuck in a vacuum, yall ain't nothing but a whole lot of suckin', goin' on in rap
yeah but i'm home
bad to the bone,
back in the zone,
let him alone
you don't wanna go eggin' him on
it'll never be my chair that you're on
crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen
other words there's no heir to the throne
when i die so does hip hop
hitchcock, better shit bitch ass got, a zip locked in a bag
you fags ain't been able to fade me since kid rock had a high top
keep blogging while i'm mind boggling my zone like i'm in the twilight,
talking of my bone this is my mic dog i like hogging it
flow so wet i'mma take this beat tobogganing
i'm water logging it, i'm sogging it
pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
suplex it on cement like i'm on some straight outta compton shit
take this dick and chomp on it
i'm so bad i can bitch slap a back handed compliment
jackass eat a donkey dick
the game i just about conquered it, like donkey kong
i'm bonkers bitch, i'm the king of this honkey shit!
i reign supreme in this honkey shit!
no sense screaming, and arguing
makes no difference whether a benz or bentley or a beamer's the car you in!
you think you ball well i palm it
i throw up bombs when i vomit
boy i throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omelette
but you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic
i should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
bitch i'm as bat shit as ozzy it's obvious
you can tell i go right off the bat
no pun intended but come any closer i'll bite off your head
tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web
i'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
i catch a fly in that bitch you think you fly you just food
i give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude
guess i just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and baboozled
confused as usual and you can get ripped she can open a can too
but you better hope you can handle the heat
or stay the fuck outta hell's kitchen
i came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken
yeah it's shady slut the rest can suck on a big one
cos i'm as despicable, as daffy duck when i'm spitting,
(ha ha recovery)

sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
mind full of demons, i don't wanna hear them anymore
got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
so they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
smoking weed, can all make a change
so i'm told, but i haven't seen the change unfold,
i keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
communities in need of people that will lead
keep your eyes open, i can only say i'll try
until the day i die

<i>[chorus - twopac]</i>
niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile, was a problem child
try to put me in the courts but my force was wild
bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style,
these niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile, was a problem child
try to put me in the courts but my force was wild
bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
i could be wrong but i never got along with cops

putting money on my head
go on and get your refund motherfucker, i ain't dead i'm the diamond in the dirt,
that ain't been found i'm the underground king and
i ain't been crowned when i rhyme, something special happen every time
i'm the greatest, something like
ali in his prime
i walk the block with the bundles i've been knocked on the humble
swing the ox when i rumble show your ass what my gun do
got a temper nigga, go ahead, lose your head
turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
i walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
till i bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over
if it wasn't for rain joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain

<i>[chorus - twopac]</i>
niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile, was a problem child

let's pretend marshall mathers never picked up a pen
let's pretend things would have been no different
pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin they could blow away with the wind
marshall, you're never gonna make it makes no sense to play the game there ain't no way that you'll win
pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
and it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changing again
he wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
he had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
fuck a talent show in a gymnasium, bitch, you won't amount to shit quit daydreaming kid
you need to get your cranium checked you thinking like an alien and just ain't realistic
now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed it
and his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap olympics
slept through his plane and he missed it
he's gon' have a hard time explaining to hailie and lainie these food stamps and this wic shit
cause he never risked shit he hoped and he wished it but it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here
he pretends that


<i>[eminem:]</i>
they ask me am i okay, they ask me if i'm happy
are they asking me that be
cause of the shit that's been thrown at me?
or am i just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there
and i continuously stare at pictures of you
i never got to say i love you as much as i wanted to, but i do
yeah, i say it now when you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now?
but somehow i know you're near me in presence
oh, i went and dropped some presents off for easter
to them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
minds a little, and dog, you'll never believe this
but sharonda actually talks to me now â jesus!
and everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
man, how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us?
they say grievance has a way of affectin' everyone different
if it's true, how the fuck am i supposed to get over you?
difficult as it sounds

<i>[obie trice:]</i>
doody, i dropped a tear in a rhyme
the day you find it is the day i stop missin' deshaun
holton, it was written, it was woven
for a soldier to leave so suddenly â got me wide open
how could god take a soul so dope and
turn around and leave us all heartbroken?
know that you're sayin', "keep goin'!
be a man! no emotion!"
it's your duty, until we meet again, doody

<i>[eminem:]</i>
"doody" â that's what we'd call each other
i don't know where it came from
but it just stuck with us; we was always brothers
never thought about each other's skin colors
'til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
it was like ninety degrees, i was catchin' a sunburn
tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
i'm moanin', i just wanna get home and
i look over, and your shirt is off
i'm like, "you're gonna fry," you're like, "no, i won't
i'm black, stupid! and black people, they got melatonin
in their skin â we donât burn," meanwhile my face is glowin'
and i feel like i'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughin' at me
and snappin' at me with your shirt, bastard
and i still have to get you back for that shit
and by the way, them playboy rings my mother stole from you
well, nate finally got 'em back, shit
it must've been at least sixteen years ago
well, i put 'em in your caskâ oww
movin' past it, it still ain't registered yet
but you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
the motor city, motown, hip hop vet
hip hop shop, dreads, it don't stop there
yeah, as difficult as it sounds

<i>[obie trice:]</i>
doody, i dropped a tear in a rhyme
the day you find it is the day i stop missin' deshaun

and this might sound a little strange, but i'ma tell it
i found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and i picked it up to smell it
i wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass
and hang up in the hallway so i can always look at it
and as for all me and dtwelve we feel like "fuck rap!"
it feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
we shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
our two-ways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and i know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is they're all still here, and you ain't
purple gang, you gotta keep pressin' on
don't ever give up the dream, dog, i got love for you all
and doody, it's true you brought people together
who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker, doody
i know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
but you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
if it had to happen, it had to happen
believe me, i know you're the one who taught me to throw them bows back on dresden
from eggin' cars to paintballin' and gettin' arrested
to sittin' across from each other in cells, laughin' and jestin'
they tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
i guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
me, you andâ¦ what's his face? i forgot his fuckin' name
shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
and if i see him again i'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
and thatâs on hailie jade, whitney laine and alainaâs name
i'll let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
in the air for you, and pour some liquor out
with obie in the parking lot of fifty-four just before
we were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
difficult as it sounds

<i>[obie trice:]</i>
doody!


<i>[eminem:]</i>
i can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling

i eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em
the only fucking thing that you consume is time
i'm super human, my world is like a rubik's cube
it's too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming
my mentality's caveman stupid woman
my life is truman show, all i have is music hoe
i stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
cause you better put a fork in it if you think i'm a lay here just spooning yo
oh you think you the shit 'cause i just said you was beautiful
diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
rotten to the core, to the bunghole all the way down to my soul, from my head to my toe...
ever since i was thirteen i learned how to sew, so shut my own booty hole
cause i ain't took no shit since i looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
i told these stupid hoes when i come back i'm a set this bitch on fire
and this time i don't mean i'm a pour gasoline on some chick and light her
cause this time when i fuck this world i'm put my whole god-damn dick inside her
i ain't even put my tip in that hoe yet
i'm go get nickel and try to rip it wider

classical poems
battle my own demons
i need a glass of patron
bad as i need a horn
stabbing my clavicle bone
i'm matador prone
first time i seen a desert eagle
i was letting the forty-four buss
the forty-four pop
first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs
looking at robocop
i'm not a man, i'm a logo, i'm sustain
in order to clean my veins you need saline
i'm never referring to the solution
i'm talking about more like the mustang vroom
get respect from the get-go, hello
set to the echo, psycho
pen got a mind of it's own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
i'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
as the echo follows the maserati
as the petrol swallows,
i'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant
i'm fly like i'm, killing the scene like i'm a villain with wings
i'll sleep when i'm six feet deep,
right now i'm living a dream
though we may be reckless
the ladies check us
they whisper "shady records"
baby echo

<i>[hook: lazie boi]</i>
cause baby i'm lonely
can somebody hold me
it feel like i'm fallin now, i can't hold my ground
it feels like i'm only
trying but slowly
it feels like i'm fallin now, i can't hold my ground
no more

<i>[verse one: tyga]</i>
probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
in time itâs all better, âcause time heal whatever
i'mma need a moment cause moments last forever
cars with cream leather, females are on regular
whatâs the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
iâd rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
now ready, sean don got me feeling heavy
she like one more chance, more problems, no biggie, ah
itâs all good, donât take it the wrong way
ainât nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
we can leave together or you can take your space
the night young, we should head over to my place
ha, now we laughing and all that
tell your friend they can fall back
ainât even gotta ask twice
she said what you feeling like?
i'm like...

jimmy can crack corn but i don't care
my enemies crack corn but i don't care

you can be black white or albino yeah
you can have cornrows inside your hair
i give a fuck if i don't like your stare
this bottle of wine goes upside your head

a little bit psycho but i know that
think you just don't say it and i won't say it
see if you don't brag then i don't brag
i know i'm bad as long as i know i'm bad
i don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
you can just keep making them tired old threats
little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
see me but don't dare to try no shit
cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
the rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
and i can be so quite and strike so fast
like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast

uh, first verse, uh
i'm armed/on 'til i'm on a island
my life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
before i touch dirt i kill y'all with kindness
i kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
you've been warned if you've been born or if you conform
slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
and hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
me and shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow
i might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
though i ain't wrapped tight
my blood type's the 'eightys!
my 'ninetys was like the navy, you was like the bradys
you still fly kites daily!

catch me in my mercedes
bumpin' "ice, ice baby" screaming, "shady 'til i die!"
like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
so i live it to the fullest 'til i'm swayze
and you only live it once, so i'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
wait, no, stop me now 'fore i get on a roll (danish)
let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
and i hope that i don't sound too heinous when i say this
nicki minaj, but i wanna stick my penis in your anus!
you morons think that i'm a genius
really i belong inside a dang insane asylum, came to drive them trailer parks
crazy, i am back, and i am razor-sharp, baby
and that's "back" with a capital b with an exclamation mark,
maybe you should listen when i flip the linguistics
'cause i'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit
you don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'cause after i spit the bullets, i'mma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
i'mma kick the ballistics! so get this dick, i'mma live this

my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
at war with a bottle, as captain morgan attacks my organs
my slow flow is euphoric, it's like i rap endorphins
i made a pact with the devil that says "i'll let you take me
you let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse of jack kevorkian"
go back and forth in more beef than you can pack a fork in
i'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
my tenement, chimney now; the semiâs the remedy, pow
spin him around, enterin' in the vicinityâ

<i>[eminem:]</i>
now, was called m&amp;m, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
chewed him up and spitted him out
girl, giddy-up, now get, get down
he's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit-fit now
here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
did i s-st-stutter, motherfucker? fuck them all,
he shuts the whole motherfuckin' walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
and he came to the club tonight with five'nineâ³ to hold this bitch down
like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, she tryna d-dr-drown
shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick suckin' lips, i'm agitated, aggravated
to the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then i'm have to take it

<i>[royce:]</i>
and then after takin' that, i'mma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
it's gon' say "the whole rap game passed away" on top of the affidavit
graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
to michael jackson's activator (woo!)
meanin' i'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up data
rolling over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
homie, they're sick, you can normally ask a hater
don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
drop in the lap of a tax evader (homie, they spent)

<i>[eminem:]</i>
now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
what, girl, i'm the crack-a-lator
percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later

spilled gravy, all over my damn navy blue avi
bye bye


"yo man.. yo marsh man, you've been kickin' all this shit about yourself, what about the homies man?"

"ai, you want one about the posse, aight" 

oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
oh, oh, ph, ohh
foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride

well foolish pride has alot of things to say
you got foolish pride, you got tooth decay
but tooth decay is another problem
so let's take this old foolish pride and solve it
now, when i talk about foolish pride
i mean blacks &amp; whites taking different sides
when blacks and whites take different sides
unity never happens, and we will subside
we will subside and hatred will release
and everything will just crush that peace
well, when we crush that peace, we start hatin' each other
but remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
just like i'm a mister
i seen a black girlfriend and i kissed her
i kissed her; i placed it on her cheek
and she didn't come back til next week

now it was next week and she was back again
wanting to kiss a white kid
so she was my girlfriend, we started going out
but that's okay because we were black and white
blacks and whites they sometimes mix
but black girls only want your money cause they're dumb chicks
so i'ma say like this
don't date a black girl, take it as a diss
if you want, but if you don't
i'ma tell you like this, i surely won't
never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
and that shit ain't funny

so i'ma say look honey
why do you do this?
you know, you step up to me like you a brutus
then you try to grab my spinach
because its green and that's cash
so get outta here, 'cause i don't need your ass
i said that before, but that's okay because like i said you're a whore
black girls and white girls just don't mix
because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
white girls are good; i like white girls
i like white girls all over the world
white girls are fine and they blow my mind
and that's why i'm here now telling you this rhyme
'cause black girls, i really don't like
we don't mix, it's like riding a bike
when you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
you know it's kinda hard and that's why i say to you
i'm giving you a little advice
don't date a black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice
you won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
and that ain't funny
so i'ma say look honey
i thought i said that before
but like i said again you're nothing but a big whore
so when mike catch on the bass line
that's okay 'cause we will not just waste time

i'll get straight to the point
black girls are bitches, that's why i'ma tell ya you better pull up your britches
'cause all that cash is making your ass drag
from the boyfriend ya ganked and that's pretty bad
i mean that's pretty sad when ya dating a black guy
and then you turn around and fuck another big, black guy
now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
but that's okay because you need a goddamn spanking
from me, the funky eminem
i'm busting rhymes and i'm swallowing phlegm
i'm busting a freestyle just like this
i say swallowing phlegm and howard gets pissed
but when howard gets pissed that's okay
because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
so i'll just worry about that problem when i come to it
i cross that bridge when i come to it

because, i forgot the chorus
but that's okay 'cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us
so i'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl
she turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
a wack girl, because black girls ain't funny
all they want is your godamn money
they take you for everything you got
and then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand
so i'ma kick it to you just like this
how does the chorus go, i forgot
but that's okay, 'cause i'ma tell you in stride
i'ma say oh foolish pride

oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
date a white girl, 'cause they got the raw hide...

you think i'm a nuisce, i'm impressive i'm the new madonna
jeffery dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
a lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest, to be honest
hip hop ain't been the same since tupac moved to cuba on us


<i>[sample fourx:]</i>
"fuck it, friends or no friends i had enough bullshit to last me clear to the end"

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i shoulda been able to see that you were the one behind this
but i was blind as fuck to think that you weren't the kind that stuck some more in the spine this
it was as if our friendship broke in half
and watch you turn everything into a game and joke and laugh
and both of us know we can't discuss the situation
like adults each confrontation just results in accusations and insults
so i'ma just let it go for now
and leave you be, it's over now
what goes around comes back around
believe you me, lay low for now, come here you fuckin'

<i>[hook - proof:]</i>
come here you fuckin' backstabber
why i oughta, beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you fuckin' backstabber
why i oughta, beat a nigga that's up to no good, haha

<i>[sample twox]</i>

<i>[eminem:]</i>
why don't you take a second to stop and think about what you done
and you want to call that being a friend, that isn't what you want
all because of what you run your mouth, you wanna prance around and gloat?
let's see how well you dance around when i got my hands around your throat
cause it's a matter of time till i get my blows in and it won't be long
you shouldn't go walkin' around and stickin' your nose in where it don't belong
cause every time you talked when you was stretchin the truth
theres gonna be one more flyin' knuckle you're gonna catch in the tooth
come here, come here you fuckin'

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[sample twox]</i>

<i>[eminem:]</i>
come here you lil double-crossing goin behind my back snitcher
good for nothin but trouble causin instigating fact switcher
you were the least that i suspected
till the puzzle fell into place with every piece that i selected
but i'll never let that crap happen again
you come back blabbin' again
catch it smack dab in the chin
that's for backstabbin a friend
cause every name in the book
wouldn't be enough
so i just figured i'd say your name in the hook
check it out, come here you fuckin

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[sample fourx]</i>

<i>[proof:]</i>
backstabbers don't live too long
around my way friendships betrayed
in the hood you die for that!
for those that don't love this combat and verbally say this
this could relate to the death of a backstabber
thats like the desire to make total discombobulation and combustion of the neck
the backstabber for the female, you skeezin' ass bitch nigga!
so remember, the backstabber always loses in the end
a friend is a friend to the end
f-r-i for fri, e-n-d a friend for the end..yes
to eternity..the backstabber shall never flourish
take em out...


<i>[eminem:]</i>
i ain't gonna eat, i ain't gonna sleep
ain't gonna breathe, 'til i see what i wanna see
and what i wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
permanently, you just being hurt
this ain't gonna work for me
it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
cause we, are just gonna be, enemies
as long as we breathe, i don't ever see, either of us
coming to terms, where we can agree
there ain't gonna be, no reasoning, speaking wit me
you speak on my seed, then me, no speak-a ingles
so we gonna beef, and keep on beefing, unless
you're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
and settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
a demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
and you're gonna see, this gangster pee on himself
i see you dtwelve, and thanks, but me need no help
me do this one all by my lonely
i don't need fifteen of my homies
when i see you, i'm seeing you, me and you only
we never met, but best believe you gon' know me
when i'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
come on bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
you was gonna do, that's what i thought, you're pitiful
i'm rid of you, all of you, ja, you'll get it too!

<i>[obie trice:]</i>
we got you niggas nervous
on purpose, to hurt your focus
you's not mc's, you's worthless
you's not them g's, you's a circus
you's no appeal, please
you's curtains, you use words kool herc slurred in two thousand third
you's purping, you's no threat, who's ya serving
when lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
you fuck with a label overseeing the earth
shady muthafucka, o. trice's birth
and as i mold, i become a curse
so we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
depicts fiction in his verse
and as i breathe, and you be deceased
the world believe you deceived just to speak
you's not the streets, you's the desk
use not your chest nigga, use a vest
before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[dmx:]</i>
hey dog, i'mma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
i'mma stay blazing new york with the heat
stalk on the beat, walk with my feet
understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet
peep how i'm moving, peep where i'm going
shit don't seep, then sleep not knowing
but i'mma keep growing, getting larger than life
easy going with the same one that started the fight
he be knowing how dog get, when dog don't bite
tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
grand champ, and my blood line is tight
cuz it's all good, it's all right
niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
blood line, and, we can go track for track
damn, dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem:]</i>
all you motherfuckers, take that
here, take this too, bitch
uh, uh, uh, uh, wahoo
we're killing all you motherfuckers dead, all of you
fake ass gangsters
no more press
no more press
rot, motherfuckers, rot
decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfucking dirt
die nameless, bitch, die nameless, no more fame
ahh, hahahaha
yo x, come on man, obie, let's go, haha


<i>[introduction:]</i>
shut up and sing
listen gone again.....

<i>[eminem - verse one:]</i> 
have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
when they know they're your heart
and you know you were their armour
and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
but what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
and everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
what happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"daddy look what i made", dad's gotta go catch a plane
"daddy where's mommy? i can't find mommy where is she?"
i don't know go play hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
i'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
and put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
that's slim shady, yeah baby, slim shady's crazy
shady made me, but tonight shady's rocka-by-baby...

<i>[rihanna - chorus:]</i>
listen gone again
story of my life
searching for the right
but it keeps avoiding me
listen gone again
sorrow in my soul
cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company
<i>[repeat]</i>

<i>[jay-z - verse two:]</i>
they say "they never really miss you til you dead or you gone"
so on that note i'm leaving after the song
so you ain't gotta feel no way about jay so long
atleast let me tell you why i'm this way, hold on
i was conceived by gloria carter and adaness revees
who made love under the siccamore tree 
which makes me
a more sicker m.c. and my momma would claim
at ten pounds when i was born i didn't give her no pain
although through the years i gave her her fair share
i gave her her first real scare
i made it from birth and i got here
she knows my purpose wasn't purpose
i ain't perfect i care
but i feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear
now i'm just scratchin the surface cause what's burried under there
was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
i went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted
but i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
hold on

<i>[rihanna - chorus:]</i>
listen gone again
story of my life
searching for the right
but it keeps avoiding me
listen gone again
sorrow in my soul
cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company
<i>[repeat]</i>

<i>[eminem - verse three:]</i>
i keep having this dream, i'm pushin' hailie on the swing
she keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"you're making mommy cry, why? why is mommy crying?"
baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, "daddy you're lying
"you always say that, you always say this is the last time
"but you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine"
she's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
"daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!"
goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
it's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe daddy, take it withcha'"
i look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
these fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man i can hear 'em
they're saying "you've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight
now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
and just as i go to walk out of my bedroom door
it turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
and i'm singing...

<i>[rihanna - chorus:]</i>
listen gone again
story of my life
searching for the right
but it keeps avoiding me
listen gone again
sorrow in my soul
cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company
<i>[repeat]</i>

listen gone again...

<i>[swift:]</i>
i'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
i'm quick to murder ink with lead
and i ain't talking 'bout a pencil
look at what the fuck you done got into
i see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
claiming you a murderer, and you spelled it wrong
you put e before the d, 'cause that's all you on
you on pac's dick, you a replica guy
if he was still alive, you would never get by
all you do is cry, bitch, keep it real
life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
and what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
that another nigga got you? they didn't see skills
and i ain't playin', you a brother getting cheated
and ja rule be prayin' on his cover, 'cause he need it
and all you niggas hating, shut your mouths!
it's just that real niggas ain't buying that shit y'all put out

<i>[obie trice:]</i>
doe, rae, me, but we don't sing, motherfuckers
so murder inc, do your thing, motherfuckers
you unleashed on a team
who expects nothin' less than r&amp;b coming from that regime
"regime" is a little extreme
neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' marines
ja sold his soul to sing
weave eye-witness team on the tv screen, chase the greed
now that you've embraced the green
don't fuck with the triple beams
you's a motherfuckin' actor, slash pac impersonating rapper
slash billie holiday â how it happen?
artist and repertoire saw him in action
pac assassination, def jam grabbed him
told him, "reenact him, you go platinum!"
they seen it for sure, i know that afeni shakur
don't enjoy jeffrey atkins reenacting her boy
so i'm click-clackin' this toy, mash and destroy
shady slash aftermath and detroit, motherfucker!

<i>[eminem:]</i>
doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
don't blame me 'cause you washed up, lost your spot
mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not twopac
don't hate me, i'm too hot and you're not
shooting at me, with the only shot you got
ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not twopac
you'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

<i>[kuniva:]</i>
now, we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
to the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
we don't take you serious, nigga, you shook
you half of a half-way crook; get off x dick, go sing a hook!
nigga, and you can't replace the late great one
and when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
nigga, please stick to the script
before the guns stick to the clip
and benzino, you ain't shit but a bitch!
fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
built up, slap you like grimace, all sensitive
wait a minute, hold on: is it me, or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
a bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
with them short ass arms, like a tyrannosaurus rex
you niggas can scream, holler and curse
go ahead and respond
and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

<i>[proof:]</i>
slim didn't send proof to get at the wankstas
he told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
what up, gotti? and this little war you pushed on
put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
what's wrong? didn't think we strong with real niggas?
roll like a boss, in the streets they still feel us
it's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
you talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
contact was blown by benzetta in the source
threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
now irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
but detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

<i>[kon artis:]</i>
word to my nigga bugz, punks like you get beat up
stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
this rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
with dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
who's behind ya? cadillac pac or that transvestite?
that dress like a lil kim fox
you're just like a little windbox
press tight on the trigger of this glock
swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
you knock pac's songs without love to help you sleep
you got shot in your video trying mock pac
you mockaveli; get your own identity!

<i>[eminem:]</i>
doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
don't blame me 'cause you washed up, lost your spot
mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not twopac
don't hate me, i'm too hot and you're not
shooting at me, with the only shot you got
ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not twopac
you'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
fuckin' punk-pussy bitch! i'll fuck you up, boy! never!
don't you never in your motherfuckin' lifeâ¦
i'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget

<i>[announcer]</i>
welcome back, to the stage of history

<i>[eminem]</i>
yo.. slim shady!
yo.. i'll fuckin.. i'll..
i'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
battle? i'm too weeded to speak to
the only key that i see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two adidas and beat you
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
i'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse 
you'll think i pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you 
(bitch!) i ain't no fuckin g, i'm a cannibal 
i ain't tryin to shoot you, 
i'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass 
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
i'm so bananas i'm showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it 
while i sit back and just hope it catches 
blow you to fragments
laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes

i see the light at the end
but every time i take a step, it gets dim
tell me is this hell we're livin in?
if so, heaven's got to be better
but if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

<i>[j-black]</i>
am i the worst? because i, never go to church (never)
i run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
i'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
leave the e.r., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
one day we all gon' die
but when i die, i'ma be so high
that i'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
i smoke 'til i choke and i sex a lot
i got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
now if i pray everynight (night)
do i still have to hold my trey very tight?
you feel me god? i done did so much shit while on earth
i smoke, i drink, i curse, and to make matters worse
i bust my gun first, and then i chat with your corpse
since way back, i was one to never like back-talk
see me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a nordface
nickle nine at my waist, god done lost faith
angels greet me but i don't reply back
just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's thai at?

<i>[chorus one/two]</i>

<i>[announcer]</i>
maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
final battle, fight!

<i>[masta ace]</i>
analyze the strength of my game, like lee corso
call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
and of course, yo, y'all know i'm no stranger to danger
like christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
i breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
and beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
my pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
tie your wife to the back of a black jag and i drag her
ten blocks, untie the bitch and i still bag her
give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
my shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
my flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
everyday i grow more older, and more colder
fly you to colorado, roll you over with a boulder
i know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[j-black]</i>
but every time i take a step, it gets dim..
tell me is this hell we're livin in?
haha..

<i>[announcer]</i>
time's up!
you lose!

<i>[japanese woman's voice]</i>
katta ne.


your mother, you fuckin faggot

la da da, da da da, da da <i>[repeated]</i>

aiyo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of erik schrody
rest in peace, we aint forget about you, you fuckin homo
we still remember

there once was a man who liked to jump around (jump around)
but he got too old to jump up and down (up and down)
(so then what happened?)
so he put the mic down and picked the guitar up (picked the guitar up)
(and then he what?)
started singin the blues like there's no tomorrow (no tomorrow)
(come on) left his boys in the house of pain (the house of pain)
it was the wisest decision he ever made (ever made)
but the dumbest thing he could ever do (could ever do)
was try to buck a three hundred and eighty on those that act shady
tell me now what you gonna do (now what you gonna do)

<i>[chorus]</i>
cause i remember all those years
how it was when you were here
i remember how it was, how it was when you were young
yesterday was so long ago (long ago)
kid rock and limp bizkit came along now
don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

i remember back when you had the knack (had the knack)
and i remember when you had your first heart attack (heart attack)
i was right there laughin when i heard the news (heard the news)
i just wish the cardiac would'a murdered you (would'a murdered you)
maybe ice-t's right, you are a bitch (you are a bitch)
you come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich (leave when you're rich)
but the dumbest thing that you could ever do (you could ever do)
was try to buck a three hundred and eighty on those that act shady
tell me now what you gonna do (now what you gonna do)

<i>[chorus]</i>

yo (yo) yo (yo) yo (yo)
remember back in 'ninety-four, like right before ms. everlast was whitey ford
before his heart attack had him on life support
when house of pain was out of fame like someone doused the flame
and they became destined to never jump around again 
or even further back, when i first had heard the knack
and you were down with syndicate, i went to get your shit, man
i was into it
but then you went and took your style and switched the shit
now you sound ridiculous you dickless piece of shit,
how could you diss me, bitch?
i liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude,
remember sway and tech when i came up and sat beside you
started rhymin, then you left the room 
and didn't say goodbye or nothin?
like you mad that someone else was
white and tried to rhyme or somethin
i'm sorry man, i wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
but you're a homosexual, white rappin irish {muslim}
man i wish i was irish, i could be a {muslim} too
then i'd be confused as you, and i wouldn't know what to do
what's up with you? 
i never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
knowin i could rap circles around you, what, you nuts as me?
plus i can sing better than you and i don't fuckin sing
and probably play guitar better, and i ain't never touched a string
but i ain't mad at you, i'd hate me too if i was you
i'm what you used to be, shit you was me in 'ninety-two
so everytime i write a lyric, i'mma think of you
and maybe that'll help me know what it's like to sing the blues

<i>[chorus xtwo]</i>

you fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy, fuck
and by the way, a three hundred and eighty's a fuckin sissy gun
if you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin real gun
you little bitch
next time say my fuckin name in a song
don't be subliminal about it
you wanna fuckin diss me, diss me you fuckin faggot
you fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin little bitch, fuckin cunt


damn it feels good to be back
i'm having a relapse

how the hell did he manage
to get more felony charges?
he's already got life in jail
man, what the hell is his problem?

well to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
they compelled me
to kill this elderly man

and i get these panic attacks
pop a xanax, relax
try to stick my fucking dick
inside a mannequins ass

then i get manic depressed
and the orthodontist get gas masked
kick ass
the first thing i'll put on is the mask

speaking of masks, man
it aint to late to have a change of pace
and take it off and show my face
so you can see the things you face
and slice you up
and cook you after your murder
by strangulation

thats bacon souffle
you making aint you
well thank you jason

there goes one more coma
due to blunt force trauma
just give me one more soma
and i'll be done for it mama

go in the damn broom closet
another valium lost it
shovin the vacuums nozzle
down the bathroom faucet

it seems like every day i get a little flakier
the medication is making my hands a little shakier
hand me that eighteen month old baby
to shake him up
it'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
breaking his neck in eighty some places

baby here shady comes lady
he's got the razor ba-blades and the cha-cha-chainsaw-saw baby
you b-b-blundering bumbling m-m-mumbling dumm dumms
yeah, here i come come you hear the rumbling, vrum vrum

theres something inside of that blue tarp
and that drum drum
a head and torso of someone
where'd it come from?

who's it belong to
maybe that girl with the long blond hair
who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms
clearly theres some'n wrong
'cause she didn't come home

shes missing
where is she
something fishy is going on
i guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs

now everybody get your dance on
to my damn song
c'mon


<i>[chorus xtwo:]</i>
if i die young, bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song

<i>[lil wayne:]</i>
she got that good good, she michael jackson bad
i'm attracted to her, for her attractive ass
and now we're murderers, because we kill the time
i knock her lights out and she still shine
i hate to see her go, but i love to watch her leave
but i keep her running back and forth like a soccer team
cold as a winter day, hot as a summer's eve
young money thieves, steal your love and leave

<i>[gudda gudda:]</i>
i like the way you walk and if you're walking my way
i'm that red bull now let's fly away
let's buy a place, with all kind of space
i let you be the judge, n' n' and i'm the case
i'm gudda gudda i put her under
i see me with her, no stevie wonder
she don't even wonder, coz she know she bad
and i got her nigga, grocery bag

<i>[chorus xtwo:]</i>
if i die young, bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song

<i>[eminem:]</i>
man, if i could sing. i'd keep singing this song to my daughter
if i could hit the notes, i'd blow something as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her, how proud i am that i got her
god, i'm a daddy, i'm so glad that her mom didn't...
now you probably get this picture from mu public persona
that i'm a pistol packing drug addict who bags on his mama
but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
cause there's a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside my soul
and just know that i grow cold of the older i grow
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world and i think my neck is breaking
should i just give up or live up to these excpetations?
now look, i love my daughter more than life itself
but i got a wife that's determined to make my life living hell,
but i handle it well, given the circumstances i'm dealt
so many chances man, it's too bad coulda had someone else
but the years that i've wasted is nothing to the tears that i've tasted
so here's what i'm facing, three felonies, six years of probation
i've went to jail for this woman, i've been to bat for this woman
i've taken bats to people's back, bent over backwards for this woman

<i>[chorus xtwo:]</i>
if i die young, bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song


<i>[dr. dre]</i>
check check, one,twoâ¦one,twoâ¦one,two (it's rolling)
yea yea yea dr. dre up in here y'all know what this is.
it's what y'all been waiting for funk master flex, big kap,
def jam records giving it to you baby.
yo eminem! show these mother fuckers what time it is baby

<i>[eminem]</i>
i used to be a lonely man, only mad, until i got a million dollars, shit
now if i only had some fucking hair i'd pull it, faster than a bullet
out of tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
i'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident
i had my back against the fan and chopped it off in amsterdam
i hate the straight jacket it ainât latching, and can't lock it
so they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
the cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
before me and just kept throwing they fucking self at it
my head is aching! i'm dedicated to medication
but this med is taking too long to bring me this sedadation? (come on!)
anyway i got down with dre (what up?)
the first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
running up and down the street screaming "fuck the police!"
when you still had your mother's fucking nipple stuck in your teeth (fucking baby) 
became a role model after colorado
now all they do is follow me around and holla bravo!
hell yea i punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
suck my dick bitch!
i'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but i won't
cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
so put a sock in it with your fake-ass tupac image
you faggots ain't tough you just get drunk and become talkative (wanna fight?) 
i'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking
walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
so when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling
a bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
i ain't buzzed! i'm just high on life
so why on earth would i need drugs, when i can fly on kites motherfucker? slim shady
<i>[dr. dre]</i> 
dr. dre!

<i>[eminem]</i>
i'm drunk pass the tec
cause if i get locked up tonight!

<i>[eminem]</i>
the whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
i set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (ahh!)
psych i'm just joking, for christ sake
donât get so bent out of shape
cause i went out and raped six girlfriends
some people just don't get it, but i won't let it upset me
cause they don't know better
they don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
and fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
my mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes i can't find it at home
it hides in the stove (hello, where you at?)
shit, talk about your brain being baked
my shit's still in the oven on four hundred and eighty degrees
hailey jade, daddy loves you baby,
don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter! fuck you lady!
you critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
the neighborhood that i grew up in you could die for nothing
and dirty dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
i'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth
and shove his head in the fan blade
don't ever tell me what i can and what i can't say
or change cause of the age-range in my fan base
like i give a fuck who's buying this shit
quit fucking buying it, i'm tired bitch, i'm dying to quit
hip-hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
it's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
but now the white kids like it, so they tell me i can buy it
but as soon as i get on the mic it's like the night gets silent
either that or booed, thatâs why i keep an attitude
and go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
i'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge
i'll confess to every murder i committed since three years old

<i>[eminem]</i> 
cause if i get locked up tonight!

fuck that, turn that shit off
let's get the fuck out of here
you know how we do <i>[echo]</i>


ah, yeah (it's like this, like this)
this is eminem, baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
('til forever, 'til forever)
one time for your motherfuckin' mind (for mc's, mc's)
we represent the three hundred and thirteen, you know what i'm saying?
yo, they don't know shit about this, for the 'ninety-six

ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
to get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
a brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
you look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
my rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
i travel through your mind, and chill your spine like siren drills
i'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
and twistin' necks of rappers
'til their spinal column disconnects
put this in decks and check the monologue
turn your system up, twist 'em up
and indulge in the marijuana smog
this is the season for noise pollution contamination
examination of more car-tunes than animation
my lamination of narration
hits a snare and bass on a track for duck rapper interrogation
when i declare invasion
there ain't no time to be starin', gazin'
i turn the stage into a barren wasteland

i'm infinite; you heard of hell
well, i was sent from it
i went to it, serving a sentence
for murdering instruments
now i'm trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat, i'm tempted
to make another attempt at it; i'm infinite

bust it! i let the beat commence
so i can beat the sense in your elite defense
i got some meat to mince
a crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
i greet the gents and ladies, i spoil loyal fans
i foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
one thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people
mc's are feeble, i came to cause some pandemonium
battle a band of phony mc's, and stand the lonely one
imitator, intimidator, stimulator
simulator of data eliminator
there's never been a greater since the burial of jesus
fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
my thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
my a cappella releases classic masterpieces
through telekinesis, it eases you mentally
gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
with entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

i'm infinite; you heard of hell
well, i was sent from it
i went to it, serving a sentence
for murdering instruments
now i'm trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat, i'm tempted
to make another attempt at it; i'm infinite

man, i got evidence, i'm never dense
and i've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
to do some shit that represents the mo
so i'm assuming all responsibility
'cause there's a monster will in me
that always wants to kill mcs
mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
no one else is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
i get cynical, act a fool, then i send a crew back to school
i never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
i'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
in fact, i can't see, or can't imagine
a man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
so this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
on my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan b
be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit
i'm tensed a bit, and tempted
when i see the sins my friends commit

i'm infinite; you heard of hell
well, i was sent from it
i went to it, serving a sentence
for murdering instruments
now i'm trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat, i'm tempted
to make another attempt at it; i'm infinite

'ninety-five, 'ninety-six ('ninety-six)
and on and on and on (and on and on)


"so let's get down to business
i don't got no time to play around, what is this?"

<i>[scratching]</i> what is this? what is this?

<i>[intro]</i>
the invasion! (invasion yeah)
green lantern! the infiltration, we comin'! (yeah)

<i>[bridge: eminem]</i>
i got fifty cent, i got g-unit
d-tweezy in this bitch, wit obie trice!
so watch what you say, 'fore you call our name
cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!

<i>[verse: eminem]</i>
whoa, here we go, i should've' known
i was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
sooner or later you little haters
are too jealous of us to love us
you hate it g-unit made it and obie's coming
d-tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
fifty percent of it's fifty cent
the other fifty percent of it's who's color of skin it is
but if you even considerin' taking our label down
you better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
but i ain't trying to get too intricate into it
i'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
cause then it's gonna get to the point
where it escalates to some other shit
then i'm a flip, then i'm a get to
"stomping in my air force ones"
but you won't be able to tell
if it's two pairs or it's one
it's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
you'd think nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
i don't know what it is or what it could be
but i get a woody when these pussies try to push me
thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
y'all tickle me pink
i think i'd just rather have pink tickle me
hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
a little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
mixed with a little bit of the
jigga-ja-jigga
wit a small pinch of biggie
look at me, i'm just the bomb diggedy

we the realest label
don't try to act like you don't feel our label
cause we gonna fuck around and steal your paper
obie, d-tweezy, g-unit, fifty,
we gonna kill your fuckin' label for sure!

<i>[eminem]</i>
shady in the place to be see
and i got what it takes to +roc the mic+ right!
still watch what you say to me punk
cause i'm off probation in less than six months <i>[gun cocked]</i>

<i>[outro]</i>
haha, shady records
still aftermath, and don't think we don't
hear you motherfuckers talkin'!
cause we do and we see y'all
we just gonna sit back for a minute
while i see what the fuck y'all do


i've got a riddle, whatâs little and talks big
with midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle
thatâll do anything to throw dirt on my name
if it means walking the whole mediterranean
is he an albanian, armenian, iranian, tazmanian
no it's dave, raymond and oh, osorio
so sorry whoa, but that was a long time ago
when i was just joe shmo, rapping in joe blowâs basement
i apologized foâ it before, so
either accept it or you donât
and letâs move on, if i ain't shown that iâve grown
then get the bone, keep licking these nuts
you industry mutts, keep walking around sniffing each otherâs butts
or should i say asses?
what would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses?
the question i ask is..
how can i explain this?
how can i swing this, in english language?
if i switch to slang and turn mayn to mayn
do i do it in vain, or simply to entertain?
am i being real or am i being fake
am i just a fraud or am i truly genuine
or am i caught up in this hot water
woady on my daughter i told you i love this culture
donât let em insult ya, iâma tell you one more âgain
this is the environment that i was brought up âin
but every now and âthen, i use my âpen
to get rid of some frustration, or should i say shon
is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism?
your face is numb, youâre stunned you look as cold
like that of a man whoâs seventy some years old
and it only gets colder, which is why i understand
i canât be mad at a forty four year old fan
with a chip on his shoulder
who only owns half of a magazine, and the only way to have it seen
is to put me on the front of it again
only thing that makes him grin, is to see me frown
papa canât stand me, papa needs to take his medication and sit the *** down
in his new chair that goes round and round
that he bought from new money in his bank account
that i get him every issue when the thang comes out
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side
yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride
but ain't nobody over here buying two white guys
disguised as pro-black thereâs no slack for a hartford college grad
in a fitted hat and a hunch back, standing by the clearance coat rack
in some old slacks and some rso throwbacks, yeah


let it go
gotta let it go
keep living your life cause its your time
your time, your time, your time.

let it go
you gotta let it go
keep living your life cause its your time

have you ever loved someone so much,
you'd give an arm for.
not the expression, no, literally give an arm for.
when they know they're your heart
and you know you are there armor.
and you would destroy anyone that would try to harm her.
but what happens when karma,
turns right around and bites you.
and everything you stand for turns on you to spite you,
what happens when you become the main source of the pain

'daddy look what i made' 
'daddy's gotta go catch a plane'
'daddy, wheres mommy,
i cant find mommy where is she.?'
'i don't know go play hailie baby your daddy's busy'
daddy's writing a song
this song ain't gon' write itself,

i'll give you one underdog
and you gotta swing by yourself
then turn right around in that song
and tell her you lover her.
and put hands on her mother
who's a spittin' image of her.

'baby daddy ain't leaving no more'
'daddy your lyin, you always say that,
you always say this is the last time,
but you ain't leavin no more, daddy your mine'
she's piling boxes infront of the door

'daddy please daddy don't leave daddy no stop it'

'this will keep you safe daddy take it witcha'

(ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
no worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
what else could i possibly do to make noise?
i done touched on everything but little boys
that's not a stab at michael
that's just a metaphor, i'm just psycho
i go a little bit crazy sometimes
i get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
good god, dip, do a little slide
bend down, touch your toes and just glide
up the center of the dance floor
like tp for my bunghole
and it's cool if you let one go
nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
give a little "poot poot", it's ok! <i>[*fart sound*]</i>
oops, my cd just skipped

all i know is when i get there
someone's gonna touch my body

excuse me, miss, i don't mean to sound like a jerk

they say i was running butt-naked
down the street screaming
(ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
well, i'm sorry, i don't remember
all i know is this much
i'm not guilty
they said, "save it, boy, we gotcha you on tape yellin' at an old lady to 'touch my body!'"

now this is the part where the rap breaks down
it gets real intense, no one makes a sound
everything looks like it's eight mile now

"i've always looked at battle rap as competition or war, and the main objective is to destroy, completely fuckin' obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything, whatever the fuck you can, to get a reaction from the crowd. so nothing's off limits."
i need you to spit that lyrical miracleâ¦ in the swimming pool

before this kicks off, let me set my balls in this tees
'cause i'm dottin' i's every time i cross one of these
there's not a redeeming quality at all in me
it's impossible, seems like an implausible dream
positive clean thoughts intervene
but they're all either altered and mean
assault and demean, tossed and they're being lost in the scheme
squashed in between a brainwashing machine
like an islamic regime, a jihadist extreme radical
suicide bomber that's seeing
ariana grande sing her last song of the evening
and as the audience from the damn concert is leaving
detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region
i'm not gonna finish that, for obvious reasons
but bring your dogs, i'ma muzzle 'em
i'm not middle eastern but i'll make a bitch raqqa hijab
and at least a extra large in a t-shirt
headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet, hasta la vista
i go hamas on the beats to a paradox on the beach
and a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list
gettin' head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich
professional shit sprayer
bitch watch who you talkin' to, like apple wristwear
endangered species in this abc shit a bit scarce
prey's decreasing, i face extinction like disc players
told this chick she's hot as jada pinkett
and just stared 'til i made her think it
said, "maybe we should just get married."
she's facing me, i placed my feet with my hips square
tell her, "turn around," spread her legs for me, then i hit bare
leave her stretched out like a baby t-shirt on ric flair
as i rip, tear, anal beads in a split rear
spray febreze in the chick's hair
make her wheeze tryna get air
i played for keeps, there's no escaping me, i have a bitch scared
and chained to me, and throw away the key
and she'll be so afraid to leave
that even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there
tryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up
it's impossible like rapin' a slut
we stay butt-naked and fuck
you're close, wait for you, what?
my idea, you comin' too, is waking you up
with smelling salts after i quaalude your cup
that'll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup
hate to get bogged down in details
but bitch, i'm like the dog pound with females
my brain is corrupt, real life, hillside strangler
i strangle a skank's neck 'til it's triangular
shape but it's upside down, and my mouth ain't gonna shut
and mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck
or helps you rake in the ducats, i want payment in pub
'cause i ain't tryna get in your bars like i'm waiting the club
but if you put me in your lines, i'm takin' a cut

get a million writers inside of a room combined in it
try to get every idea of every possible line to spit
every punchline, every combination that rhymes with it
bitch, a whole team can't see me, there's no i's in it
head so big, i shot myself ten times in it
tryna commit suicide and it, took five minutes
and i survived the shit
someone's gonna challenge me, who?
battle me and win, that's a fucking fallacy too
you name one motherfucker in this galaxy, *spits*, reality
you fantasy, rally your troops, try to boost the morale
only time i start a movement's a bowel
i can't even give a "yeah" or a "woo" when you rap in the booth
not even a "nah" or a "boo"
'cause even though i'm allergic to the crap that you spew
when i'm 'bout to break out, i don't mean get a rash from it too
'cause when i say i have allergies, i actually do
but that's just an analogy, i've never had a reaction to you

creature from the black lagoon
i reach up and i smack the moon
you're grief struck that i'm back so soon
your teacher for this afternoon
creep up with a pack of hoodlums
we pack a punch like capri sun
heat tucked like we each snuck in a submachine gun
we stuck in a submarine bun, with a bag of shrooms
cup of lean up in the padded room
justin bieber in a catholic school
selling dust and reefer when your back is to him
don't adjust your speaker
i'll cuss the stripes off of a fuckin' zebra when i'm at the zoo
huffin' cleaner 'til i gag from fumes
fuck christina with a plastic spoon
while i bump some g-funk and blast some snoop
'cause her double g-cups are massive, huge!
it's fun for me just to grab a boob
plus my penis got an attitude
my fuckin' weiner's in a combative mood
come and suck a mean one like it's mad at you
i speak tongue-in-cheek, what you asslicks do
'cause you love to eat butt, it's sad but true

i just sprung a leak suddenly
what i think in my gut instinct become in sync
my thoughts and my stomach link up with each other
ink touches the pad, then boom!
since the day dre gave me beats, i was made elite
that's basically what makes me me
creating stink, 'til these tats are fading ink
who's the greatest? think we're still debating, wink
add, and better put out an apb
'cause it'll take lapd and me layin' in the street
for you to see shady beat
and i'll bet ya they'd need cleats
'cause i'd have to be stomped by forty men to suffer a defeat
i pray please jesus to make me decent
inhaling the main ingredient of pain relievers, and saline
i take three aleves, tryna break these fevers, i'm ailing
i stay free of divas and ladies screamin'
'cause they keep schemin' on me
vading keepin' the women at bay
like laci peterson, baby fetuses
legs and feet have been weighted, chained in semen
it's straight demonâand wait!
even if it takes meat cleavers to make believers
mistake-free schemes are enablin' me to remain deviant
breakbeat, eat her like steak meat
emcees take seats like amc theaters
deranged ringleader, depraved king
who mainstream media hates
which makes things easier, still under scrutiny
villainous smooth criminal, livin' room
with the nude reese witherspoon
who was bruised, beat with a broom
it's in two pieces, and lays deceased in it
pit with a chewed leash, and his chain-link leapin' it
live in the booth, shave, eat, bathe, drink, sleep in it
r-a-p bleed the shit, still and i poop, pee it
it's a spillage, a sewage leak, waist-deep feces
the syllables ooze fecal, they feel like renewed leases
'cause my brain releases 'em

like waste excretion, it's simultaneously
as i'm givin' these fools grief, they're feelin' the blues
'cause even if stealin' my shoes, thieves
just to fill 'em's a huge feat
a hill and it's too steep
obey these demons, we're still in cahoots
keep feedin' me blank sheets
as soon as i sink these teeth
and i'm killin' the loose leaf
time to shake these trees again
wait, make that phrase repeat again
killin' the loose leaf, shake these trees again
get the rake, but it ain't me leavin' 'em

vicodins, nuprins, i bite them and chew them
the whites and the blues mixed with nitrous balloons
and i like to sniff gluesticks, put ricin on toothpicks
on the mic i'm just ruthless, a crisis, a nuisance
who i influence i give two shits
if they wanna license my music to entice with
then use the shit like it's the blueprint for isis recruitment

excuse me while i stare into space for a few
in a daze or haze, glazed over, crazed warped loon
mental cased off, always had a straight-forward view
but you bozos keep givin' the flamethrower fuel
no one's ever sank lower, shrewd, and way more rude
beast-mode like a lawn-mower blade rolled through it
and this has little to do with bein' gay, boy
it's just where the wordplay's goin'
but ain't much i can say or do
'cause ain't no excuse, the way i go at you {censored}
you say i'm always screw-faced
so if i look your way, you're screwed
'cause if looks could kill, i could start a hate war too
'cause i'd murder you straight bitches by turnin' the gaze on you

let's take it back before the tightly-worn pants
to the nike, jordan, hats
the stripe lee's, jordache, and the white tees
lightning storms might be formed fast
such a frightening forecast
but when you're slightly hoarse, rasp
from the cyphering or-gasp, but still reciting your raps
while you're tightening your grasp around the mic 'cause you done shitted on it so much, you're always reminded of your past
'cause your heiny's sore, that's
'cause you still haven't finished fuckin' wiping your ass
from the night before last
no good, but rap somethin' i'm too-good-for-my-own-good at
fuck adulthood, i'm a grown-up brat
where your cojones at? mine are always being rode, in fact
they're frozen, you ever seen a cul-de-sac?
so big they fell out my scrotum, i just sewed 'em back

dick so long, need a shoulder-strap
for that, gotta unroll it and fold it back
so difficult to wrap in the prophylactic, it overlaps it
so i pack a trojan so fat, when i lay it flat it's like a yoga mat
make a bitch think she's in aerobics class
the bear you don't wanna poke is back
the backbone of rap, your fuckin' lead singles are my bonus tracks
when i appear, my peers stop
hearts fall in their stomach, their spirits drop
careers flop, their gears lock, severe shock
fear at the mere thought
lyrics are top-tier, i'm so high at the top
i'm in the sky when i talk
bitch, i'm so fly when i walk, my ears pop

oh, and i'm just playin' ladies, you know i love you
i got a idea for a line


you sound like a bitch, bitch
shut the fuck up
when your fans become your haters
you done?
fuckin' beard's weird
alright
you yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (you want smoke)
we doin' this once
you yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
why you yell at the mic? (illa)

rihanna just hit me on a text
last night i left hickeys on her neck
wait, you just dissed me? i'm perplexed
insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
damn, i'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
was watchin' eight mile on my nordictrack
realized i forgot to call you back
here's that autograph for your daughter, i wrote it on a starter cap
stan, stan, son
listen, man, dad isn't mad
but how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
and have a man-bun?
the giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
i say one call to interscope and you're swayze
your reply got the crowd yelling, "woo!"
so before you die let's see who can out-petty who
with your corny lines ("slim, you're old") -ow, kelly, ooh
but i'm forty-five and i'm still outselling you
by twenty-nine, i had three albums that had blew
now let's talk about somethin' i don't really do
go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
but you're a fuckin' mole hill
now i'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
gunner? bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (brrt)
playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (hold up)
are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
what the fuck's in the bowl, milk? wheaties or cheerios?
'cause i'm takin' a shit in 'em, kelly, i need reading material
â¦dictionaryâ¦
"yo, slim, your last four albums sucked
go back to recovery," oh shoot, that was three albums ago
what do you know? oops
know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? yeah, i had enough money in 'two
to burn it in front of you, ho
younger me? no, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
i'd rather be eighty-year-old me than twenty-year-old you
'til i'm hitting old age
still can fill a whole page with a ten-year-old's rage
got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
feel like i'm babysitting lil tay
got the diddy okay so you spent your whole day
shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
got you at your own wake, i'm the billy goat
you ain't never made a list next to no biggie, no jay
next to taylor swift and that iggy ho, you about to really blow
kelly, they'll be putting your name
next to ja, next to benzino-die, motherfucker!
like the last motherfucker sayin' hailie in vain
alien brain, you satanist (yeah)
my biggest flops are your greatest hits
the game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
so before i slay this bitch i, mwah, give jade a kiss
gotta wake up labor day to this (the fuck?)
bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
in a state of bliss 'cause i said his goddamn name
now i gotta cock back, aim
yeah, bitch, pop champagne to this! (pop)
it's your moment
this is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
had to give you a career to destroy it
lethal injection
go to sleep six feet deep, i'll give you a b for the effort
but if i was three-foot-eleven
you'd look up to me, and for the record
you would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
lick a ballsack to get on my channel
give your life to be as solidified
this mothafuckin' shit is like rambo when he's out of bullets
so what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?
had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
how the fuck can him and i battle?
he'll have to fuck kim in my flannel
i'll give him my sandals
'cause he knows, long as i'm shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
exhausting, letting off on my offspring
lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
you dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
you're fuckin' salty
'cause young gerald's balls-deep inside of halsey
your red sweater, your black leather
you dress better, i rap better
that a death threat or a love letter?
little white toothpick
thinks it's over a pic, i just don't like you, prick
thanks for dissing me
now i had an excuse on the mic to write "not alike"
but really i don't care who's in the right
but you're losin' the fight you picked
who else want it? kells?
attempt fails! budden, l's!
fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as cottonelle
killshot, i will not fail, i'm with the doc still
but this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
but, kells, the day you put out a hit's the day diddy admits
that he put the hit out that got pac killed, ah!
i'm sick of you bein' wack
and still usin' that mothafuckin' auto-tune
so let's talk about it (let's talk about it)
i'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
need to get the cock up out it
before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
i'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
that you're marshall mathers (marshall mathers)
don't mean you are, and you're not about it
so just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

you fuckin'... oh
and i'm just playin', diddy
you know i love you


<i>[gwen stefani:]</i>
here to stay
even when i'm gone
when i close my eyes
through the passage of time
kings never die

<i>[eminem (gwen stefani):]</i>
i can hear the drummer drumming
and the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, i know something's coming
but i'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
and plummet, how come it wasn't what i thought it was
was it, too good to be true?
have nothin', get it all but too much of it
then lose it again, did i swallow hallucinogens
'cause if not, where the hell did it go?
'cause here i sit in lucifer's den by the dutch oven
just choosing to sin
even if it means i'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again
do whatever i gotta do just to win
'cause i got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
crown around it, thorns on it
cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think i'd be back, did ya?
how 'bout that, i'm somehow now back to the underdog
but no matter how loud that i bark, this sport is somethin' i never bow-out at
i complain about the game, i shout and i pout, it's a love-hate
but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt
even when you bitches are countin' me out, and i appear to be down for the count
only time i ever been out and about
is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
'cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here but i'm not a quitter
gotta get up, give it all i got or give up
spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
i'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong
'cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
'cause someone told me that
(kings never die)

<i>[eminem:]</i>
don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
you ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
wouldn't even take shit into consideration
obliterate anyone in the way
i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
but it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
tell these new artists that kings never die
i know shit has changed in this age, fuck a twitter page
did it just say i've been upstaged?
why am i on-line? it's driving me crazy
i'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
on what's hot, but i'm not one to conform
but as days pass in this shit
and opinions sway, i can hear 'em say
if i stay passionate maybe i can stage a miraculous
comeback as if i went away
but detractors just say so much for the renegade
someone's gonna make me blow my composure
here i go again, center stage and i feel like i'm in a cage
they so want a champion to fall
it's no wonder why i laugh at 'em, 'cause why can't we win 'em all?
so fuck what these cynics say
(it) just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
and i'm under attack again, that i'll act as if i'm 'posed ta
with this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
on the floor stacked against the door
are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
'cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
and trophies just don't mean jack anymore
if i'm here today and gone tomorrow
and i'm not gonna be

<i>[gwen stefani:]</i>
here to stay
even when i'm gone
when i close my eyes
through the passage of time
kings never die

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i want it, i'm comin' to get it
so you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get riddick bowe'd
critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
and i ain't stopping 'til i'm on top again
all alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
or a homage poem, or an ode i've been owed
tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
and when it's my time to go, i'm still not leaving
stop for no one, i don't know but i've been told an obstacle that
blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause

<i>[eminem:]</i>
they say kings never die
just ask jam master jay
they just grow wings and they fly
so, hands up, reach for the sky
try to hold on and prolong these moments
'cause in a blink of an eye
they'll be over

<i>[eminem:]</i>
so you're tryna secure your legacy like shakur
and ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
so before you're leavin' this earth
you want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
deacon of words, syllable genius at work
plus i'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
i went from powdered milk and farina
to flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
at gilbert's to arenas, call me gilbert arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
i made it to the silver screen but rocky's still what the theme is
khalil on the beat 'cause makin' the beat ain't the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
it's that "soundbombing" thirstin' howl
common, underground, diamond d, outsidaz
stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
god just give me one shot, i swear that i won't let you down
i'mma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
you ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say i ain't

<i>[gwen stefani:]</i>
here to stay
even when i'm gone
when i close my eyes
through the passage of time
kings never die


there's a certain mystique when i speak,
that you notice that it's sorta unique,
cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep,
and i'm still matic the way i flow to this beat,
you can't sit still, it's like tryin to smoke crack
and go to sleep, i'm strapped,
just knowing any minute i could snap,
i'm the equivalent of what would happen if bush rapped,
i bully these rappers so bad lyrically,
it ain't even funny, i ain't even hungry,
it ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
for you to play me, it's cockamamie,
you just ain't zany enough to rock with shady,
my noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo,
i got screws loose, yeahhh, the whole kitten-kaboodle,
i'm just brutal. it's no rumor, i'm numero uno, assume it,
there's no humor in it no more, you know
i'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag,
you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass

<i>[chorus]</i>

there used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme and
wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
but now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
it's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rapping
we actually tried to stop the fifty and ja beef from happening
me and dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it, he wasn't going to go after him
until ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed him
fuck it, fifty smash him, mash him and let him have it
meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing?

<i>[chorus]</i>

i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up
and stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying
cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in
either kept getting broken into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

<i>[chorus]</i>


don't stop
don't stop

<i>[royce da five' nine"]</i>
yeah, bad and evil is (back)
we bout to get into a tail of gunner that details the dungeon
this is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
oh once again where i fail from blundering
shady lifted his wing than i fell from under it
now i'm freefallin'
my career is gone and the weed callin'
regardless of who's fault i was b-ballin'
god bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the earth
marshall double backed and got me from on top of the hearse
i'm alive nigga, justin t ain't got nothing on me
cause i done cried mary j blige rivers
i realized that god's with us as soon as i decided to put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges
the writings on the wall since niggas seen me at the baseball game with shady and jay-z
suddenly everybody calls
"like i'm just checking on you dog"
while i throw up this message on the star

i'm living proof nigga
its pretty safe to say
god giveth and god taketh away
its the worldwide american way
i'm living proof nigga

<i>[eminem]</i>
your body language is sayin' your confidence is gone
well pick ya ass up lil homie, come on
you just gone sit there and take it or make em suck it
tell em where to shove it straight up, you gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it?
the last time the light kicked me in the ass
i pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass
man what a catastrophy it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
and not open a can of whoop ass
did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day i say i aint poop
shit, the day that i dont straight shoot
i'll drop out of my anti-women hate group
say i'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back and put it on straight loop
you haters look like you ate a grape fruit
you see me climbing back on that wagon
got my swagga back i was dragging, hop back on it
grab the reigns on that bastard and came back on em
without remorse man
man of course i'm a one trick pony
cause i'll be screaming on these whores till i'm hoarse!

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[royce da five' nine"]</i>
nah i aint fading yet
i'd rather stay and rap
i mighta made a deck
i find excitement in wondering what i'ma write next
so i dont stay in debt
me broke
you might aswell cut the embryo out my momma and play catch with the baby
with ak's with baby bayonet's
i'ma get rich or i'mma die trying
thats why its either kill or be killed
so call me suicide homocide ryan

<i>[eminem]</i>
theres a bomb inside my head
i'ma live wire, i am on the edge
teetering on it like i tore the iron mike
get on a nut like a tyre iron
i have no desire stopping so why would i drop and roll
that's how much on fire i am
rappers are fun and i'm the time cause i'm just flying by 'em
man i'm laughing at 'em the entire time, why am i up?
cause tribulations i have triumphed bitch i'm fired up
so it's time for me to slit your fucking lighter, light the sky up

<i>[chorus]</i>


<i>[eminem]</i>
look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted-one moment
would you capture it or just let it slip?

his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
he's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,
but he keeps on forgettin what he wrote down,
the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
he's choking now, everybody's joking now
the clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
oh, there goes rabbit, he choked
he's so mad, but he won't give up that
easy, no
he won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
it don't matter, he's dope
he knows that, but he's broke
he's so stagnant that he knows
when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
back to the lab again yo
this this whole rhapsody
he better go capture this moment and hope it don't

my god my tourniquet

my god my tourniquet

<i>[eminem]</i>
the soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
this world is mine for the taking
make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
a normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
it only grows harder, only grows hotter
he blows us all over these hoes is all on him
coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
lonely roads, god only knows
he's grown farther from home, he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
his hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose dove and sold nada
so the soap opera is told and unfolds
i suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
da da dum da dum

my god my tourniquet

<i>[eminem]</i>
no more games, i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
i was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
i been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhyming and stepwritin the next cypher
best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the fact
that i can't get by with my nine to five
and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
cause man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
and it's no movie, there's no mekhi phifer, this is my life
and these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
trying to feed and water my seed, plus
teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama's screaming on and
too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot, another day of monotony
has gotten me to the point, i'm like a snail
i've got to formulate a plot or i end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
mom, i love you, but this trailer's got to go
i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go is my shot.
feet fail me not cause maybe the only opportunity that i got

i roll like a bus, nine-eleven pulse same color as cranberry sauce,
i ain't gonna front, i thought r-kelly was tha shit,
then we find out he fucking round with bow wow bitch,
niggas eatin popcorn, right, rewinding the tape,
now shorty momma in the precinct hollerin rape,
i'm convinced man something really wrong with these hoes,
i thought lil' kim was hot then she start fucking with her nose, (god damn)
used to listen to lauren hill and tap my feet,
then the bitch put out a cd that didn't have no beats, (uh-huh)
that boy d'angelo he determined not to fail,
that nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell,
my back shot to help ashanti hit them high notes,
and big ben taught charlie b-more to deepthroat

<i>[verse one: eminem]</i>
they ask me am i ok
they ask me if i'm happy
are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
or am i just a little snappy
and they genuinely care
doody, most of my life its just been me and you there
and i continuosly stare at pictures of you
i never got to say i love you as much as i wanted to but i do
yeah i say it now and you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now
but somehow i know you're near me in presence
oh i went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
and dawg you'll never believe this
but sharonda actually talks to me now
jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
man how you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
if it's true, how the fuck am i supposed to get over you
difficult as it sounds...

<i>[hook:]</i>
i see no man left in them mirror
life seems so hard
i feel just to give up
i just wanna get on with my life
but its to difficult
i just spend my day drowning
in sorrow
alone with my thoughts
i ain't got time to borrow
i just wanna get on with my life
but its to difficult

<i>[verse two:]</i>
doody, that's what we call each other
i don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
we was always brothers
never thought about each others' skin colours
til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
it was like ninety degrees, i was catching a sun burn
tryna walk under the trees
just to give me some comfort
i'm moaning i just wanna get home
when i look over and your shirt is off
i'm like you gonna fry and like
"no i won't, i'm black stupid
and black people they got melatonin
in their skin, we don't burn"
meanwhile, my face is glowing and i felt
like i'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughing at me
and snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
and i still have to get you back for that shit
and by the way them playboy rings
my mother stole from you
well nate finally got em back
shit it must have been at least sixteen years ago
well i put em in your cask-ahhh
moving past it, it still ain't registered yet
but you can bet your legacy they'll never forget
the motor city motown
hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads
it don't stop there
yeah, as difficult as it sounds...

and this may sound a little strange but i'mma tell it
i found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and i picked it up to smell it
i wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass
and hang it up in the hallway so i can always look at it
and as for all of me and dtwelve we feel like fuck rap
it feels like our general just fucking died in our lap
we shut off all our pages
all our cell numbers has changed
our two-ways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and i know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is there all still here and you ain't
purple gang, you gotta keep pressing on
don't ever give up the dream dawg
i got love for you all
and doody, it's true you bought people together who never
woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker doody
i know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation
and truly hated the feuding
but you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
if it had to happen, it had to happen
believe me, i know you're the one who taught me to
throw them balls back on dresden
from making cars to paintballing
getting arrested
to sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting
they tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
i guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality, left sweating
me, you and what's his face
i forgot his fucking name
shame he even came to your funeral
he betrayed our team
and if i see him again i'mma punch him in the fucking face
and that's on hallie jade, whitney lane and alaina's name
i let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
for you and pour some liquor out for you with obie in the parking lot of fifty-four
just before we were supposed to get in cars
to come and see you once more
difficult as it sounds

<i>[hook:]</i>
i see no man left in them mirror

it's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
it wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)

<i>[eminem]</i>
left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
went up in eastland and shot a policeman
fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
the shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan
and for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
grab a couple grand and lamp in iceland
see i'm a nice man but money turned me to satan
i'm thirsty for this green so bad i'm dehydratin
hurry up with the cash bitch, i got a ride waitin
shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
i want the whole pie, i won't be denied nathan
maybe i need my head inside straightened
brain contemplatin, clean out the register
dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description and sketches ya
the connection was the prime suspect
but i ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
cause i got a daughter to feed
and $two hundred ain't enough to water the seed
the best thing would be for me to leave taco bell and hit up chess king
and have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the mac
cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
this bitch tried escapin the jack
grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
you barely heard a word as she choked
it wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
but i slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
just then the pigs bust in yellin "freeze"
but i'm already wanted for sellin ki's
and bunch of other felonies from a to z like spellin bees
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees
i bust shots, they bust back
hit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest
left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
blew the back end out this lady's jag, started blackin out
pulled the mac-ten out, stuck it in her face
shut your yackin mouth, 'fore i blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
drug her by her hair, smacked her up
thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
stole her car, made a profit
grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
like the girl in "set it off" did
jetted off kid, stole the whip, now i'm a criminal
drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
climbed out and collapsed on the patio
i made it out alive but i'm injured badly though
parents screamin: "son, go in and call the police
tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
actin like they never seen nobody hit a ;ick before
smashed the window, grabbed the nintendo sixty-four
when they sell out in stores the price triples
i ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an eighty-year old lady with groceries
there goes cheese, eggs, milk and post toasties
stood up and started to see stars
too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
but i think somebody seen me maybe
plus i lost the damn nintendo and i musta dropped the beanie baby
fuck it i give up, i'm surrounded in blue suits
came out with a white flag hollerin "truce truce"
and surrendered my weapon to cops
wasn't me! it was the gangster rap and the peppermint schnapps

all my life i was very deprived
i ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
clothes ripped like the incredible hulk (hachhh-too)
i spit when i talk, i'll fuck anything that walks (c'mere)
when i was little i used to get so hungry i would throw fits
how you gonna breast feed me mom? (wah!) you ain't got no tits! (wah!)
i lay awake and strap myself in the bed
put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (bang!)

this guy at white castle asked for my autograph (dude, can i get your autograph?)
so i signed it: 'dear dave, thanks for the support, asshole!'

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
stop the tape! this kid needs to be locked away! (get him!)
dr. dre, don't just stand there, operate!
i'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
i'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
am i comin or goin? i can barely decide
i just drank a fifth of kool-aid -- dare me to drive? (go ahead)
all my life i was very deprived
i ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
clothes ripped like the incredible hulk (hachhh-too)
i spit when i talk, i'll fuck anything that walks (c'mere)
when i was little i used to get so hungry i would throw fits
how you gonna breast feed me mom? (wah!) you ain't got no tits! (wah!)
i lay awake and strap myself in the bed
put a bulleproof vest on and tap myself in the head (bang!)
i'm steamin mad (arrrggghhh!)
and by the way when you see my dad? (yeah?)
ask him if he bought a porno mag and seen my ad

<i>[chorus]</i>


this motherfucker, man
just won't shut up, will you?
talking 'bout i owe him
bitch, you owe me
i'm promotin' you right now
yo, let's put the nail in this coffin

i don't wanna be like this
i don't really wanna hurt no feelings
but i'm only being real when i say
nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (nope)
and old men have heart attacks
and i don't wanna be responsible for that
so, put the mic down and walk away
you can still have a little bit of dignity

i would never claim to be no ray benzino
an eighty-three-year-old fake pacino
so how can he hold me over some balcony without
blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me?
please don't, you'll probably fall with me
and our asses'll both be history
but then again you'd finally get your wish
'cause you'll be all over the street, like fifty cent
fuckin' punk pussy! fuck you, chump
give me a one-on-one, see if i don't fuck you up
tried to jump the ruff ryders and they cut you up
and you put jada on a track, that's how much you suck
dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
you sit behind a fuckin' desk at the source butt-kissin'
and beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
and you can't even get the clearances
'cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
it's not that we don't like you, we hate you, period
talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
last week you was shakin' obie trice's hand
now he's a buster? what the fuck's with that?
get on a track dissin' us, kissin' fifty's ass
and askin' me what i know about indictments, bite me
bitch, i got two cases and probation, fight me
what do i know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
what you know about your wife slicin' her wrists
right in front of the only thing that you have in this world
a little girl?
and i put that on her, when this is all over
i would never try to make her a star and eat off her
i don't know shit about no choppin' rocks
but what you know about hip hop shops rockin' spots
where you the only white boy up in that bitch just rippin'?
pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'
them bitches up after spendin' six hours at kinko's
just makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles
to sell them out of the trunk of your tracer
spendin' your whole paychecks at disc makers
what you know about being bullied over half your life?
oh, that's right, you should know what that's like
you're half white; vanilla ice, spill the beans and rice
i'm eatin' you alive inside, jesus christ
if you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down
you should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch
shoot 'em in the fuckin' headâgo ahead, bitch
slap my mom! slap the fuck out of her
she can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
'cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke
if you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck
you stop for, dummy? if you slew some crack
you'd make a lot more money than you do from rap
you'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
you'll never know what it's like to be rich
life's a bitch, ain't it? raymond?
here, let me break the shit down in layman's
terms for you, just to make sure that you can understand it and
canibus ain't using too many complicated fuckin' words for you
here, let me slow it down for you
so that you could understand if i say it slower
let it go, dog, it's over

i don't wanna be like this
i don't really wanna hurt no feelings
but i'm only being real when i say
nobody wants to hear they grandfather rap (nope)
and old men have heart attacks
and i don't wanna be responsible for that
so, put the mic down and walk away
you can still have a little bit of dignity

hahaâ¦ talking 'bout i have motherfuckers callin' your crib
bitch, you ain't even got a fuckin' crib
you ain't even got a fuckin' phoneâ¦ fuckin' bum
threatenin' to shut me down at your lil' fuckin' source magazine, if i come back on you and attack you
bitch, you attacked me first
take it like a man, and shut the fuck up
and fuck your little magazine too
i don't need your little fuckin' magazine
i got xxl's number anyways
and y'all can't stand it, 'cause they gettin' bigger than y'all
oh, and by the way, how'd i look on the vma's?
when you was watchin' me
from whatever fuckin' tv you was watchin' me from
from bostonâ¦ the mean streets of boston
fuckin' sissy! and you got us scared up in here, motherfucker
suck our motherfuckin' dicks
oh! and for those that don't know
don't get it twisted, y'all: the source has a white owner


<i>[busta rhymes]</i>
yeah
i'm in a different space in my life you know
it's a real good space too
ayo eminem i like this song man
by the time y'all hear this, weezy probably be home
welcome home weezy
reek da villain what up
ayo
let me tell y'all niggers about one of the little tough guy dreams i had the other night

look
first i stop and then i drop and then cock another heater, pop another litre from another clip
he thought he was a creature that could never never ever ever ever ever ever get his shit popped off (get his block knocked off)
when a nigger come and when a nigger front, gotta give it to him good, give a nigger what he wants
and if a nigger act up, shoot him in the head, in the face, in the stomach, in the foot or the heart
you don't want it homie, you don't wanna start especially when mo'fucker see the gun fire spark
when i got the gun up in ya mouth, i'll make a nigger gun talk 
bush rhymes reek (black)
imma hit him in the front homie hit him in the back
keep on hitting that nigger in the chest cavity till the motherfucker layng down flat
freeze motherfucker look
trust me imma make a nigger sit still
anytime i gotta defend a fool nigger, it don't matter what it is, homie i will
beat a nigger til you probably can't figure it out, i identify the mo'fucker on the reel
word on everything a nigger really love, it don't matter who it is, homie i kill
but now i'm finally waking up out of the dream and i realise that life is so beautiful
and i ain't gotta put my hand on a nigger, unless it's definitely necessary otherwise it's unsuitable
ha, going through a lot of different little things that make a nigger want to go and wanna get and wanna bring a couple goons out to handle a couple situations and let em elimination all the bullshit so i can sing
run through every city, run through every state
though we get a lot of love, i love to get a lot of hate
though the ones who will try to hate will start to love cause it's undeniable that everything i do is great, even when i do it wrong imma share it in a song and i'm questioning the words in the end all along
i guess i gotta die first return re-incarnated just to really see any other form
until that time imma sit and shine while i sit here with the grime, give me credit when it's mine 'fore i dent it with a nine millimeter see the sign and the heater then i'm giving all my people get in line now 
yeah
for the one's that hated, tried to stop my growth from the light from a ball imma fight homie grudge, it's a kanye song see the way i make a mother fucker don't know love

it's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
you kicked me when i was down
but what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)
that's right bitch: and i don't need you, don't want to see you
bitch you get (no love)
you showed me nothing but hate
you ran me into the ground
but what comes around goes around
i don't need you (don't hurt me)
you (don't hurt me no more)
that's right, and i don't need you, don't want to see you
you get (no love)
bitch you get (no love)
and i don't need you
get em

i'm alive again
more alive than i have been in my whole entire life
i can see these people's ears perk up as i begin
to spaz with the pen, i'm a little bit sicker than most
shit's gonna get thick again
they say the competition is stiff
but i get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
i ain't never giving in again
caution to the wind, complete freedom
look at these rappers, how i treat them
so why the fuck would i join them when i beat them
they call me a freak because
i like to spit on these pussies 'fore i eat them
man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
where the fuck is kanye when you need him?
snatch the mic from him, bitch i'mma let you finish in a minute
yeah that rap was tight
but i'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit
and start over from scratch and write new ones
but i'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
when i rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
it's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
in the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
you can see the sparks from hot metal
cold-hearted from the day i bogarted the game
i so started to rock fellow
when i'm not even in my harshest
you can still get roasted 'cause marsh is not mellow
til i'm toppling from the top i'm not going to stop
i'm standing on my monopoly board
that means i'm on top of my game and it don't stop
til my hip don't hop anymore
when you so good that you can't say it
because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
people just get sick cause you spit
these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
and you can never break my stride
you never slow the momentum at any moment i'm about to blow
you'll never take my pride
killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent
is getting no mercy, mark my words
ain't letting up, relentless
i smell blood, i don't give a fuck: keep giving them hell
where was you when i fell and needed help up?
you get no love

it's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
you kicked me when i was down
but what you say just (don't hurt me)
that's right, it (don't hurt me)
i don't need ya (no more)
don't wanna see ya (no more)
bitch you get no (love)
you showed me nothin' but hate
you ran me into the ground
but what comes around goes around (around)
don't hurt me (that's right)
you don't hurt me (and i don't need ya) no more
(don't wanna see ya) no more
bitch you get no love (no), no love (no), no love (no)
no love
bitch you get no love (no), no love (no), no love
and i don't need ya (no more)
bitch you get no (love)

sandy hook, stoneman douglas, another lone wolf gunman
sometimes i don't know what this world has come to, it's blowin' up
this whole country is goin' nuts and the nra is in our way
they're responsible for this whole production, they hold the strings to control the puppets
and they threaten to take away donor bucks
so they know the government won't do nothin' and no one's budgin', gun owners' clutchin'
their loaded weapons, they love their guns more than our children
shh, i think another one just entered in our buildin', and we'll be...

<i>[kehlani:]</i>
ashes blowin' in the air
our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
wasted youth, always on the road
never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'cause the skies are black
but our heart's made of gold
fuck doin' what you're told
we're goin' nowhere fast

<i>[eminem:]</i>
i feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
this road is takin' me back
down memory lane with this rap
i can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
i'm simply stating a fact
i had wembley stadium packed
but now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
another terrorist attacks
like a tariff blows half of madison square up, alas
we perish in the blast
but that isn't scaring us, we pass
nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just-

<i>[kehlani (eminem):]</i>
ashes blowin' in the air
our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(we don't give a... no, no)
wasted youth, always on the road

the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold (golden)
fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)

<i>[eminem:]</i>
fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year-old
shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways; for mc's it's a funeral
when i'm devisin' this rhyme, 'cause i'm awake and you're mourning
that's why i rise and i shine like a new day has dawned on me
gusto, guts, bravado, nuts and plus i kick up dust
and cuss a lot, i musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'cause some stuff that's awful, really don't mean nothin' although
there's a lot of shit i said in jest that's tough to swallow
but if at times my heart it seems
like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
keanu reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward, but where we're goin'
we have no idea, nowhere to go, but hysterical
it's gettin' warm in here, i set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
just one spark and it's lit, but i'ma still get dark on this shit
told you i'd leave my mark on this bitch-war machine
but you forced me in a corner, i'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
and in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
go to war with me, you'll end up blew to timbuktu, i send at you
a ten-ton nuke like kim jong-un and end up ruinin' your career
but when all is said and done
and at the end of my run, i'll just rewind clocks, forever young
make time stop, will i ever fall off? that day will never come
'til the pine box, bitch, fuck you! i'm better than i ever was
'til the bomb drops, hope it never does, but i'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
this world's screwed, it's already fucked, and i'm on top, so everyone's just-

<i>[intro]</i>
oh no whatâs happening to my brain
i canât believe this is happening again

<i>[verse one]</i>
lava out my lips i flips
wake up think i have a cramp
iâm trying to shove the lava lamp up my fatherâs ass
i think iâm out of gas, man
i think i need another mask
iâd ask my mother but i think sheâs laughing at the plants
a half a gram of graham crackers and some van de kampâs
i think iâll eat some ambiens like theyâre candied yams
cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
abrafuckingcadabra motherfucker look whoâs back
just like a pendulum, satanâs pentagram swings
i accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
shit i think i might have did it when i was dancing
while i was chopping one of my legs off and pulled a hamstring
first i re-up, then i relapse
go to rehab then i detox after i see doc
and iâll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle
cause i react like the she-hulk when i see nyquil

<i>[hook]</i>
oh no
here we go again
when itâs going to end
where did it begin
maybe way back when

<i>[verse two]</i>
into the well, baby jessica fell
she may have wetted herself
quit playing, get her some help
mary kay letourneau sending me letters from jail
every day in journals saying how
she wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo
iâm the medicine man
my medical marijuana was prescribed by a doctor
shove a typewriter up her
perez hiltonâs ass, shit, almost forgot that
heâs always shoving something up his ass so why not that?
and f-ck it while iâm venting letâs shove a vending machine
up his rear end when heâs bending over pretending that he
didnât say anything that would be offending to me
stick his head in a blender, begin blending in g
where should i put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?
put him under the stairs? people are already under there
hmm, i wonder where. wait, i think the cubpoardâs bare
stuff him up in the tupperware and shove him up in there

<i>[hook]</i>

<i>[verse three]</i>
vicodinâs like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
i bite into five and then i get high as a kite again
i like it when i get in my zone on the mic again
who am i kidding? i couldnât quit this shit if my life depends
i relapsed twice after i came outta brighton then
yeah, rehabâs nice, i had my name up in lights again
you see thatâs why i canât decipher what life iâm in
i might pull a knife on your wife and slice her and dice her then
it sounds so enticing, isnât it nice when iâm hype again?
iâm nice when iâm like this, no time to write just type it in
if i could get my pen to slow down, whatâd i write just then?
man iâm about to hyperventilate, i just have hyper-tension
i have the type of mental state you couldnât comprehend
unusually stupid of you for you to think iâm your friend
i usually do what i do and suffer no consequence
i offer no mercy, the controversy is once again

<i>[hook]</i>


here's the story, of a little boy.
growin' up in a suburban home,
trying to cope with everyday life,
who lives in a little house,
that was built, in the middle of the street.

"hey, mom!
tupac's on the juke box,
so what he shot two cops,
and raped a little girl,
while two dudes watched,"
"nuh-uh! they were tryin' to frame him,
you wouldn't have two pack shaker,"
"no! that ain't how you say his name, mum!
you're so lame,
don't you know anything?"
"yeah!
i know that you'll probably go,
and join in a gang,"
"yeah, right. i'm out
where's my fuckin' walkman at?"
"stop cussin' at me!"
"shut up, bitch!"
"and quit talking black."
well,
slammed the door and i'm out,
now, what?
it's probably warm in the house.
fuck, i forgot my jacket,
forgot it was winter.
i'm gettin' thinner,
i'm hungry.
is mom cookin' dinner?
"mom!
let me back in!
i forgot my coat.
mom, come on, i'm not playin',
it's cold!
alright, sorry.
i need a jacket,
mom, look,
my tupac tape,
i just cracked it,
ma, please let me back in,
it is two pack shaker,
i just asked him."
i'm freezin', (achoo)
i'm sneezin',
i'm breathin' too much cold air,
i'm wheezin',
"i ain't did nothin',
i didnât say "i'm leavin',"
i said "i'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin',""
<i>[scissors cutting]</i>
"alright, here.
take your damn coat and leave,"
"fine i'll leave!
mom! you cut off the sleeves!"

<i>[chorus fourx]</i>
our house,
in the middle of the street.

one, two, three,
my teacher's two faced,
she went to lower my school grades,
since last tuesday,
i had a toothache,
from kool-aid,
so mom kicked me out, (get out)
and, all i had in my suitcase,
was one shoelace,
a tube sock,
and a tube of toothpaste,
sometimes,
it was cool,
"cause i could go to a friend's,
crash there,
fool around and just skip school.
but other times,
i'd rather just be home,
in my own room alone,
beat my shit and nobody would know,
my little brother sucked on a bottle,
'til he was six,
so i'd hide it inside the couch,
and say "i don't know where it is,"
but as soon as mom found it,
i would either be grounded,
or kicked out the house,
a thousand weeks,.
and still countin',
even when i was underage,
mom was tellin' cops,
i was tryin' to run away,
i told her,
"someday, bitch, you're gonna pay,"
please, mom, please, mom, please, mom,
i wanna stay, (let me stay)

<i>[chorus fourx]</i>

my brother's incoherint,
mom's a single parent,
who ain't carin',
starin' through me,
like i'm transparent,
made it clear,
that i was just there,
to run an errands,
told her friends,
i was a son from her last marriage,
sent me up to the little corner store,
with a little note,
"please, sell my step-son,
some cigarettes so i can smoke,"
one time,
i tried to fake sick,
to get attention,
back-fired,
mom, sent me to school,
with a vengence,
my life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me,
i go to class,
and every teacher's always laughin' at me,
and mom says white rappers are laughed at.
not only that,
she heard me upstairs,
i can't rap,
and i'm stupid,
i never make an average,
of a b+,
i need to sit on my ass and sue people,
like she does,
one time, i got food poison,
from a hot dog,
mom sued and got $two,zero,
from ballpark,
"hey, ma. you got a dollar?"
"i don't think so.
now keep an eye on your brother,
i'm goin' to bingo."
"but, mom. you said you were broke."
"who said?
you got your ears messed up,
from that damn rap music."

<i>[chorus fades out]</i>


<i>[hook:]</i>
i am phenomenal
with every ounce of my blood
with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm phe-no-menal
i am phenomenal
however long that it takes
i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
i am phenomenal
but i would never say, âoh, itâs impossibleâ
cause i'm born to be phenomenal

unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
stomp you in the verse, obstacles i'm drawn to 'em
when the going got rough
some of what i done fought through was the worst, little sissy
who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
there ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
the messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
yeah, i don't try like hell, then i might as well
hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
but you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
time to slip in that zone till' i find myself
inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
into waters where nobody else has gone before
or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
bomb, i'm feelin' myself, i'm a giant
sometimes i gotta remind myself that i am...

i am phenomenal
with every ounce of my blood
with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm phe-no-menal
i am phenomenal
however long that it takes
i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
i am phenomenal
but i would never say, âoh, itâs impossibleâ
cause i'm born to be phenomenal

let me self-empower you
when you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
and you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
i'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
convert it to gunpowder too
now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
put the spark to it like martha stewart barbecuing
ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
never take back what you say
if you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
ready to scrap asap
take your fists and just ball it
show who's big and who's smallest you're christopher wallace
now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
and set it on 'em like a placemat
(i am phenomenal)
and i want you to say that

i am phenomenal
with every ounce of my blood
with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm phe-no-menal
i am phenomenal
however long that it takes
i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
i am phenomenal
but i would never say, âoh, itâs impossibleâ
cause i'm born to be phenomenal

step into the unknown and find yourself
you're floating freely, no emotion

got a fuckinâ mouth with no shut-off valve
can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
cause i worked my butt off now
it's a subject that i don't know how to shut up about
cause i stuck it out
like a motherfucking tongue thats how, i responded when i got shoved around
you're gonna have non-believers
but when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
get it how you live
but are you prepared to give more than you get?
and put in twice what you get back from this shit
though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
rap is my shiv
but it's like my shield at the same time i wield and my knife is will
sometimes i feel just like b. real from cypress hill
how i can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
i rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
ready to face any challenge, waitin'
can taste it, it's salivation, i'm wagin' retaliation
look what i have built, reputation is validation
the only thing i'm capable of makin' is amazing
only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
or accusation... i am legendary status, in fact
that is the only way you'll ever be able to say
your legend is makin' an allegation
i write with the left, same hand i hold the mic with
as i fight to the death, 'til my last breath
managed to prove who the best man is
prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standing
in the end, but i ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
cause i am

i am phenomenal
with every ounce of my blood
with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm phe-no-menal
i am phenomenal
however long that it takes
i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
i am phenomenal
but i would never say, âoh, itâs impossibleâ
cause i'm born to be phenomenal


<i>[eminem]</i>
yo.. i dedicate to this.. to yo..

<i>[imitating slick rick]</i>
to all my fans, keepin y'all in health
let's tell this whitey ford to go fuck himself

<i>[rapping normally]</i>

i upset you, cause i get respect i bet you (boy)
i'm even liked better by your niece and nephew (c'mon!)
and now you hate fred because lethal left you
peckerwood mad cause his record went wood
no respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
and said, "heck, country western rap records are good!!"
so he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
he can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both (haha)
puts an album out and rules for part of the year
then kid rock and limp bizkit come from out of nowhere
it's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
no one's tryin to hear some fuckin old fart in a chair
sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear
so you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea
figure you can diss me to jump start your career
i punch you in your fuckin chest 'til your heart kicks in gear (bitch)
and fuck your underground buddy's nameless crew
like i'ma say they names so they can be famous too

<i>[chorus twox: eminem (sung)]</i>
you just a.. quitter, and you bitter cause i came along
and the days of house of pain are gone
and if you talk about my little girl in a song again
i'ma kill you (i'ma kill you)

<i>[eminem]</i>
yo.. heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
to the rap you wrote, your fuckin answer back's a joke
and i'ma tell these motherfuckin fans the truth
the reason why you dissed me first and i answered you
you said i passed you in a lobby and i glanced at you
like i ain't notice you? bitch, i had a show to do!
like i'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you
you better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two
back in ninety-four limp opened the show for you
rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
took your motherfuckin dj and stole him too
so you fall in a slump and get all emotional
so now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick
mr. mr. ass kisser to get accepted in rap
quicker but never last, and everlast is a..

<i>[chorus]</i>
aight listen (look)
so this is what we ask of our fans
if you ever see everlast, whoop his ass
hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him
kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitch-slap him
do it for me, do it for fred, do it for limp
do it for rock, do it for rap, do it for kid
do it for ice-t, do it just to do it, fuck it
he's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin!
shit in five years we'll all be "eating at whitey's"
and he'll be bussin tables in that bitch, cleanin the toilets
aiyyo.. fuck this, cut this shit off

<i>[music stops]</i>

<i>[kon artis]</i>

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>

with his chest open
tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin
havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
cause you suck motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me
you ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
i'm a paleface killer whale
on his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha
erik remember when i passed you in the lobby that day?
that shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha
now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop
while my sales makin records break
two and a half million scanned by the second week
motherfucker i hit 'em up!

<i>[proof]</i>

<i>[swifty]</i>

i choke whitey ford with his fuckin guitar cord
and stuff him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
with sixteen parts, i stomped on his heart

cause we "hit 'em up" like motherfuckin tupac shakur

<i>[eminem]</i>

<i>[laughing]</i>

<i>[needle drags, beat stops]</i>

fuck him, that's it, i'm done, i promise, i'm done, that's it
i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i promise
i just believe in kickin a man while he's down
god damn! i quit
mention my daughter's name in a song again you fuckin punk
aiyyo..


some days i just wanna up and call it quits
i feel like i'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
every time i go to get up i just fall in pits
my life's like one great big ball of shit!

if i could just put it all into all i spit
instead of always trying swallow it
instead of starin' at this wall and shit
while i sit writer's block, sick of all this shit
can't call it shit!

all i know is i'm about to hit the wall
if i have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits
this is it, last straw
that's all, that's it
i ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic

i'm like a skillet bubblin', until it filters up
i'm about to kill it, i can feel it buildin' up
blow this building up, i've been sealed enough
my cup runneth over, i done filled it up

the pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts!
you think all i do is stand here and feel my nuts
well, imma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
if you don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch

build the dutch, i'm about to tear shit up
goosebumps, yeah imma make your hair sit up, yeah sit up
imma tell you who i be, imma make you hate me, cause you ain't me

you wait, it ain't too late to finally see
what you close-minded fucks were too blind to see
whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me

you need peace of mind? here's a piece of mine
all i need's a line, but sometimes i don't always find the words to rhyme
to express how i'm really feeling at that time, yes
sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

it's just sometimes it's always me
how dark can these hallways be
the clock strikes midnight
one, two, then half past three
this half-assed rhyme, with this half-assed piece of paper

i'm desperate at my desk
if i could just get the rest of this shit off my chest, again
stuck in this slump, can't think of nothing
fuck, i'm stumped, oh, wait, here comes something, nope!

it's not good enough, scribble it out
new pad, crinkle it up, and throw this shit out
i'm fizzling out, thought i figured it out
ball's in my court but i'm scared to dribble it out

i'm afraid, but why am i afraid? why am i a slave
to this trade ? cyanide i spit to the grave
real enough to rile you up, want me to flip it? i can rip it
any style you want.

imma switch hitter bitch jimmy smith ain't a quitter
imma sit here till i get enough of me to finally hit a fucking boiling point
put some oil in your joints, flip the coin, bitch come get destroyed

an mc's worst dream, i make them tensed, they hate me
see me and shake like a chain-link fence
by the looks of 'em you would swear that jaws was coming
by the screams of 'em you would swear i'm sawing someone

by the way they runnin', you would swear the law was coming
it's now or never, and tonight it's all or nothing
momma, jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back
he pinky promised, i don't think he's honest

i'll be back baby, i just gotta beat this clock
fuck this clock! imma make them eat this watch
don't believe me watch! imma win this race
and imma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch!

i found my niche, you gon' hear my voice
'til you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
if i gotta scream 'til i have half a lung
if i have half a chance, i'll grab it, rabbit run!


<i>[eminem:]</i>
yeah
it's my life
my own words i guess
have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
when they know they're your heart
and you know you were their armour
and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
but what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
and everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
what happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"daddy look what i made", dad's gotta go catch a plane
"daddy where's mommy? i can't find mommy where is she?"
i don't know go play hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
i'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
and put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
that's slim shady, yeah baby, slim shady's crazy
shady made me, but tonight shady's rocka-by-baby

<i>[hook xtwo:]</i>
you look like you're in another world
but i can read your mind
how can you be so far away
lying by my side

<i>[ludacris:]</i>
things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be
like all these fakin' ass rappers in this industry
talkin' bout what they got, and they ain't got a damn thang
how you own three cars, but you don't own ya own name?
get ya business right boys, the first class is in session
get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession
start up ya own company, trademark the name
that's gon' run ya bout a grand so start savin' ya change
open a bank account quick, and then follow these steps
sign yourself to yourself and start signin' ya own checks
hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need
whatever gets ya juices flowin' could be speed or weed
get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered
sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard
show all the non-believers what you destined to be
and in just a couple years you could be rich like me
but i can't hold my tongue

<i>[hook xtwo:]</i>
you look like you're in another world
but i can read your mind
how can you be so far away
lying by my side

<i>[lil wayne:]</i>
money to be made best believe a nigga clockin
i run it myself like a quarterback option
i pitch a ten g's tell a bitch to go shopping
she buy herself some clothes, and she bought me back a chopper
see niggas tryna kick it, but no i don't play sucka
i'm all about my cake i'm tryna marry betty crocker
a package on the way you know my whip game proper
and enough for one key i see seventy thousand dollas
now i was shootin dice, smokin on a joint
i bet with yo gotti, he hit five straight points
we ova here hustlin, we ova here grindin
you rap about money and nigga might sign ya
you rap about me and a nigga might find ya
banana in ya ass with ya head right behind ya
dope game bitch let his mamma worry bout him
you can holla at me for a fee

<i>[hook xfour:]</i>
you look like you're in another world
but i can read your mind
how can you be so far away
lying by my side


<i>[verse one - kxng crooked:]</i>
my name is kxng crooked, i snap on you rappers often
when i'm spazzin' i'm just gettin' my passionate point across
like a hood cat clappin' his hands when he's talkin'
now that i got your attention, i feel i should really mention
don't come around here flossin', big willies, we'll willie lynch 'em
pull out the chopper, rappers hittin' the ground
like every bar is a bullet, when i pull it, it sound like
b-b-b-b-b a couple of bullets are comin' your way then it jam
like god damn
then i pick up somethin' quicker, start killin' everything in the vicinity
the proximity, the glocksimity, we on yosemite sam
bam, bam your body drop, van damme, karate chop
the beretta's a better competitor
pop pop turn your sweater to a crop top
killin' you and whoever in that drop top
etcetera, etcetera and it will not stop
just shoot, shoot like doot doot
and beaucoup, beaucoup, i'm cuckoo
i'm a star goin' to war with you clones like count dooku
i'm worlds apart from you rappers
like i walk in the booth rockin' a biosuit made of plastic
and nasa's galactic elastic travelin' through space, interstellar rapping
broadcastin' from uninhibited planets
when i come back, that's it
you see a flash in the sky, it's that nigga, i
when i land, you wack niggas die
and your casket is your last hit
you wack bitch, fuckin' bastard
back to the hand clappin'
you die quicker than darren wilson walkin' through ferguson
dressed like the grand dragon of the klan
passin' niggas with pants saggin'
with their hand on a black magnum
to clap him backwards
so their last words is "kcuf meht nmad saggin"
that's backwards for "fuck them damn niggas"
buck them damn triggers
charge us, bodies fill up them damn rivers
cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive
but i only like dead rappers
compare me to the best rappers who died
and you rappers i used to look up to
i gotta cancel you now
like simon cowell, i can't let you ex factors survive
nah, the time's right and they finally limelightin' the god of this rhyme writin'
my mic can only be likened to poseidon's trident and zeus' lightin' strike
and my metaphors are what thor was to the norse viking
i'm a born titan and at-point kill 'em like swordfightin'
i'm slicin' organs with songwritin', i dwarf giants
i hope i'm rubbin' you pussies wrong sort of like poor dykin'
i smoke philosophy, i snort science
that means i'm higher than higher learnin', look in my eyes
that's where the fire's burnin'
try to deny music's messiah returnin'
you die and you fry in my iron furnace
i am on my get rich or die tryin' like when em was signin' curtis
cause i am murderous

<i>[verse two - joe budden:]</i>
(joe budden, jersey city, new jersey)
now we can do this a couple of different ways, it really depends
could give them classic ny jeans over the timbs
or i could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims
i could tell you why i'm hot and disappear like mims
but the bars there, put that on god, ask an atheist
and if i ain't the bomb at least i'm in the blast radius
i'm beating these kids' indictment, shit, i like the terror
apb on my actions, i'm in the viking era
moment of truth, i give you facts right now
fuck this cypher, my mind ain't on rap right now
so it's fuck metaphors and punches, all the witty shit
got a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip
face says i been stressed
i got an aunt getting her ass kicked by ms
nigga, why am i here? for the look, for the promo
shit that bothered from the start
cause the cancer left his lungs and it's on my grandfather's heart
yeah, just not the side that the beat is on
i'm supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on
i'm planning the funeral, i'm getting the hearse ready
these niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready
not a how do i feel, not a how do i deal
if that's the life, nigga, then how is it real?
these last couple of days i've been speaking to my peers
giving them cries for help, i guess they need to see the tears
but wait, wildest part of all of that is
they'll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge
but fuck it, gotta pardon 'em, shout out to my squad and 'em
house gang, shady, i'm gone, nigga, my job is done

<i>[verse three - yelawolf:]</i>
yelawolf, gadsden, alabama
my name is wayne, i'm from alabama
here's the back story
i just fell off the turnip truck with ernest tubb
i'm thirty-three, i've got three kids and i just popped three pills
i don't know which one's which or what it's for
safety ain't really a habit i've formed
i still smoke to the cigarette butt
i still drink till i end up being that klutz
clumsy, self-destructive dummy
stumbling over my words, mumbling
i'll probably do it tonight
leave the bar, leave the car
and pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars
and dream about that light that leads up to the lord
i have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard
wake up feeling like half a human
hit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret
for my lack of union between rap, you and the rock and roll community
for unity between country music and mcs, i'm claiming immunity
still i'm working, sawing, milling this tree
building this house exactly the way charlemagne the god and lord jamar thought it would be
wait a minute... the lord and the god hate me
jesus christ, i am the white devil!
nah...
i'm still working, sawing, milling this tree
building this house exactly the way i thought it should be
wanna take a tour? let's see
i've got floor-to-ceiling windows and a cabin-style mansion
bucks, bears, trucks, boats, tires, spares, four-wheelers
three-wheelers, two-wheelers, a drug dealer on call
plaques on the wall, racks on the wall for my guns on the wall
lift kits, low riders, chop shops, hi tops, low tops, cowboy boots
dixie flags, american flags, slumerican tags on my slumerican ass
ceo
i've got my name on the bathrobe, and the flame on the back porch is lit
guess who's coming to dinner?
andrã© three thousand and hank the third, go figure
i've got two stand-up jetskis, a top pedigree horse, just to pet and feed of course
who rides a horse in nashville? i might
i've got bicycles for the kids, tricycles for the babies
m-eightys, bottle rockets, bottles in my pocket
moonshine, gold watches, gold rings
all fake, no bling, don't hate, that's my thing
i've got new clothes, old clothes, vintage, tremendous, endless style
goodwill loves me mackle-more than you
i've got flat screen tvs, with skate videos on repeat
all the latest cds, mpthrees, and beats by dre
thank you very much, jimmy iovine for the check
i've got a black woman fine as she can be
fefe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind
a five, a ten, a couple hundreds layin' on the counter
i don't know where that came from
i got artwork from hard work, yardworkers for yard work
don't look under the tarp, sir
i'm growin' weed for my mama there
i've got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my harley
and i did it my way
see, hip hop is what you make of it
and i'm makin' a lot of it
see that's a quadruple entendre, jay z eat your heart out

<i>[verse four - joell ortiz:]</i>
but these cyphers, i treat 'em like a war, don't want no mediators
nah, this that grow up in the p's behavior, next door to the greasy neighbors
people thank you, i do this for all the mean creators
i was someone who never needed favors to get where i'm at
now they deem me a savior
but to be honest i ain't feelin' like that, man i just really like rap
y'all lucky, trust me
i'm opposite the hands of sandusky
with the shit that my pen state, these rappers can't touch me
ugly? shit, you serious? i'm hideous
i was better than all you silly kids while trying to figure out who i really is
as a younger dude, life was somethin' rude
i barely made it to the first like a cutler move
no rubber groove on my shoes had to fight, so suspensions
i had three in one week, yeah that was public school
did i say three in one? that's funny cause there's four of us in the slaughter
that's a three and one, i learned that in public school too
like what's in between a three and one and house gang, i spoke to all three on one call
like i dropped two albums and #three is one second from bein' done
just need y'all three to send me one verse apiece
for this heatmakerz beat and brother's keeper one
simple mathematics, i'm addin' up to all these rap addicts
i don't like to divide dough so i multiply flow
and subtract maggots
like a brand new craftmatic, boy i'm back at it
smokin' these new boys like my last habit
dabnabbit i tried to quit but everything i kick's like the last dragon
hoes suckin' my drummer dick, they on my bandwagon
i just gotta laugh cause y'all pushin' a lot of swag
i'm pushin' this big ole hearse, don't get body bagged

<i>[verse five - royce da five'nine":]</i>

why i don't be hangin' out where they be hangin' out
i tell 'em, i say "lil nigga listen here"
if i don't got no business there, i don't got no business there
see there's a difference here
you hustlin' so you can be seen
nigga i'm grindin' so i can disappear
i don't do it like other rappers do
when it's on time, it's skull and bone signs at the stu
we got guns you only find on your cheat code screen
if you think i remind you of any of these niggas you wildin' out
like chico bean
when there's drama i don't ask no questions, i just clap in that direction
i look at this gat like it's an actual accessory
i'm anti-social so relax when you step to me
nigga i shoot the breeze with actual weaponry
your lil' stare downs won't fare well
i got a pale conscience, i'm the grey area
last person i had a bond with was a bail bondsman
now imagine me hangin' with y'all and we rappin' on the same song
nigga i'd rather juggle a couple of chainsaws
or run through hell with a pair of gasoline hanes on
i'm a star but not on some i wanna be a star kinda shit
the only celebrity that give a fuck less than me is marshawn lynch
glock in the stash as a backup but the mac'll burst
cripple your style, your first born child'll come out
with a colostomy bag as the afterbirth
i don't give a fuck
nigga i'll show up to beyonce's show posin' as jay z
stagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest
lookin' like omarion holdin' his baby
jump in the four door mercedes with a .forty-four listenin' to jojo and k-ci
drinkin' and sniffin' enough blow that it got me thinkin' i can exchange sicknesses
maybe, this ebola for rabies
that's it, just livin' the rapper life
banana clip in the air, lookin' like it's 'bout to start singin' it's mac tonight
macs, i use this mac as a component for thugs rollin' up
i got this mac on and you better stay in that corner
cause shit can turn into that song except i don't give a fuck what day it is
i'll have this club goin' up, fuck with me
mack magnet, attractin' enormous green
slap this clip in this gat then call this arm christy mack
cause this bitch is that war machine
life of a giant, but who needs size when you're wack and your team's soft
drag your girl down this hill 'til she admits that it feels like she's jackin' the beanstalk
we both got marketing plans
yours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before
mine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me
and then go invest into a grocery store
rolled up with the smith &amp; wesson and drew on you like let's fight now
i do numbers, i turn you and your crew into two plumbers
translation, get your shit together and pipe down
fuck a mic, i don't write, i chew and spit
i'll shoot you and your sis if you insist
i got my eyes on the sparrow
silencer's so big it look like i got bobby shmurda tied to the front of the barrel
and he doin' this

<i>[verse six - eminem:]</i>
(my name is marshall
i'm repping that motherfucking motor city, bitch)
i just turned slaughterhouse to a quintet
began to trend-set, murdered a friend's pet
made shit as ill as it can get went in depth
like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet
i'm already covered in sweat and i wasn't even ready to come in yet
ahh, let me set this drink down
beat up a gal, start beef with her pal
probably be wild 'til i'm wrinkled and senile
and "rap god" was a freestyle
off the top of the dome piece while i was sleep on the couch
and i'm freestyling now
i need a towel, sweat leaks from my brow
it's burning my eyes, my cerebral is foul
cause shit i'm thinking about should be illegal
i need my head banned like the guy who left cleveland ohio
and went to south beach with his talents
scream "fuck you" on the way out and wink with a smile
this whole game can eat a dick, i'm going back deep underground
but right now i'm back on that bullshit and you i'm singling out
cause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while
what the fuck is this klusterfuk of busters
bunch of buster douglas', motherfuckers is one hit wonders
one swing and you're crowned
knocked one out the park, one catchy jingle and now
you think you fucking with me cause you sold like three hundred thou
bitch, i can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground
reach up, swing from a cloud with three thousand people around
evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd
and heave a child in a sink hole on cinco de mayo
when i'm sprinkled in pico de gallo
mardi gras beads in a towel
i just made that up
i don't know much spanish, i'm not bilingual
but i'll show you a mexican stand off
between just these two amigos
cause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud
but i sure as fuck think i know how read body english, no doubt
cause we're trying to kill each other, but lyrically
the fuck is humility? what is a real emcee?
royce, he came up in the shit with me
never spit that hustler shit, it wasn't a fit for me
let them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me
just not giving a fuck and plus with the history
of muscular distrophy, it wasn't a mystery
why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning
so what in the fuck is a list to me?
i'm used to not being on it, i expect it out 'em
heck wit' em, i get my respect without 'em
ain't really been into diamonds since i put my first record out
but i could put a chain around my second album
and wear it as a neck medallion
became a millionaire, went downhill from there
became civil, office swivel chair, sterling silverware
screaming life is still unfair til i get a real career
the fuck am i gonna do until then? this job is too fulfilling
two ga-jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in
and a mood to kill till i plow my coupe de ville
into some children at the food pavilion and build-a-bear
warrior's mind, iâm pro-hydrocodone euphoria
in the drug emporium line, i'm soaring
i'm pouring vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on 'em fore i go four wheeler riding
gory and violent and horrifying
you surely won't find no one more appalling
than i am with this retaliatorial rhyming for gloria steinem
but i finger her like a witness, show me a line-up
i usually am abusive, but excuse me, ma'am
i guess i must've threw you for a loop like toucan sam
when i said i could use the sample cause you's a tramp
but look how you react to this trigger like
when i call you a bigger dyke than the hoover dam
you're playing right in lex luthor's hand
it's such a ruthless plan, might even lose a fan
but fuck it, superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for stan
i'm a brand new being like grand puba's band
happy as anderson cooper having a tuba crammed
in his pooper with lubricant...wait, that's too... i can't
since honesty is the best policy i'll give you the old college try
try to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify
as a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that i swallow pride
and say that i'm sorry, sorry i can't apologize
i think of all them times i compromised my bottom lines
and thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds
then i'm like dollar signs
but i may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke
is more of a knockout than janay rice
play nice, bitch, i'll punch lana del rey right
in the face twice like ray rice in broad daylight
in plain sight of the elevator surveillance
til her head is banged on the railing
then celebrate with the ravens
never date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants
i'd meditate, but i may need a better way to escape
the aggression, rage and the anger
cause they restraints on the ankles
heavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains
this ain't enough to contain it
but i still get the same respect as jay if i came on
stage in a fucking negligã©e everyday and liz claiborne
devastated from breakup with kate hudson
wait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say
cause makeup ain't gonna cover
that eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut
peppersprayed with your face cut
made my bank like a lay up
off these effing skanks on the way up
oh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent
it's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches
yes, i said seven, i measured it
seven inches from the floor
while i'm standing on the fourth floor balcony
at the sheradon when i'm stretching it
bitch, i'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get
so if she's hesitant to get the hint
i'll bet you that i get the message sent who she's messing with
hella quick when i tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon
when i step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench
existential detriments to a lesbian devil
in the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level
that separatists like a chechnian rebel
impressionist with a pencil
a pessimist, with his lips pressed against
the edge of this red bull
pedal to the metal i'm rippin' this shit cause right away i'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever
you see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when i push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass
shadyxv as perplexing as
the last fifteen years and i'm predicting my next relapse
when i spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird
when i start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over britney spears
and these little disney queers
who use chicks for beards?
just made that up too...
oh and the shady two.zero
we wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the super bowls
cause it's supposed to confuse you hoes
the flows lose you as usual, so juvenile
two year old when i go to the studio
it's only music but don't be foolish though
you don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though
in my homie's buick
been known to lose it though so if i overdo it you drove me to it
when i step in the vocal booth like i'm supposed to do
and i murder you on a fuckin' track like tony stewart
in one take, if i fuck up and i don't redo it
you couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it
the day i don't say fuck you (w)all, you can throw me through it
rootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip
with the sentiments, eminem isn't penning them for the women
i'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot
but they consider me equivalent to chlamydia
they tryna get rid of me gadzooks
but i stiggity stand for the fliggity flag
of the united states and the freedom, i distribute these raps through
and if i catch you doing anything
hindering or prohibiting that after i give me that
tattoo of your lips on my ass i'mma be literally
pickin' up and deliberately whippin' the statue of liberty at you wooooh!

fuck it

got it somewhere in there probably


psst... hey, listen! 
lalalalala! i love my job. whoo! makes me feel like superman!
can you fly? i can. wanna see? 

<i>[chorus]</i> 
i'm only entertaining you 
my goal is to stimulate, making you high 
and take you and i 
to a place you can't see 
but i believe you can fly 
i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partying 
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian 
just a man who's on the mic 
so let me entertain you... 

<i>[eminem]</i> 
my lyrical content is constantly under fire 
no wonder why i constantly bomb back 
to combat attacks with constant concepts 
when lyrics are constantly took outta context 
failure to communicate with congress has 
been a problem for the longest, i guess 
but maybe one day we can make some progress 
food for thought - see how long it takes to digest 
feeling good when i should be ashamed 
sh*t, i really should've fell but i stood 
see i came like a flame in the night 
like a ghost in the dark; there's a ray, there's a light 
there's a hope, there's a spark 
but when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye 
until they decide to set their differences aside 
and this is why only one of us will survive 
so children follow my lead and feel the vibe, cause 

<i>[chorus]</i> 

<i>[eminem]</i> 
my music can be slightly amusing 
you shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing 
just trying to seperate the truth from entertainment 
it's stupid, ain't it? i get sick of trying to explain it 
see i could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond 
just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond 
cause i came here to uplift; let your woes be gone, 
tell 'em to get fu*ked and just mosie on 
constantly moving, constantly using the constitution 
as a form of restitution 
bless the children, nothing less than brilliant 
let me entertain you like robbie williams 
i'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuilding, 
world revolving, still evolving, still slim 
how many kids'll copy? probably millions, 
but i'ma do this as a fu*king hobby till then, cause 

<i>[chorus]</i> 

<i>[eminem]</i> 
my lyrical content contains subject matter 
that sucks up all these fu*ked up young kids 
at an alarming rate; common denominate 
add it up and you'll see just why i dominate 
i try to stimulate but kids emulate, 
and mimmick every move you make - "slim, you great!" 
but wait, can't you see i'm only here to entertain? 
i gotta be the one to go against the grain 
cause man, i see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane 
for me to see you be influenced but pretend you ain't 
but they don't understand that i've been through pain 
if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain 
but you can't just stand there and try to judge 
it hurts but you're jealousy probably tears you up inside as much 
and it's such a pleasure, every button that i touch 
i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust, but 

<i>[chorus]</i>


<i>[intro]</i>
"slim!"
hi my name is...
...bitch you make me hurl. 

<i>[verse one]</i>
they call me superman, leap tall hoes in a single bound
i'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
i'd never let another chick bring me down, in a relationship
save it bitch, babysit, you make me sick
superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on shady's dick
straight from the hip, cut to the chase, i tell a muthafuckin' slut, to her face
play no games, say no names, ever since i broke up with what's her face
i'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask
kiss my dick, get my cash, i'd rather have you whip my ass
don't put out, i'll put you out, won't get out, i'll push you out
puss blew out, poppin' shit, wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
am i too nice, buy you ice, bitch if you died, i wouldn't buy you life
what you tryin' to be my new wife, what you mariah, fly through twice...

<i>[pre-chorus]</i>
but i do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
saturday through sunday, monday, monday through sunday yo'
maybe i'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'...

<i>[chorus a]</i>
cause i can't be your superman (cry me a river)
can't be your superman 
can't be your superman (cry me a river-er)
can't be your superman
i can't be your superman
can't be your superman (cry me a river)
can't be your superman
your superman, your superman... (cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah)

<i>[verse two]</i>
don't get me wrong, i love these ho's
it's no secret, everybody knows
yeah we fucked, bitch so what, that's about as far as your buddy goes
we'll be friends, i'll call you again, i'll chase you around every bar you attend
never know what kind of car i'll be in, we'll see how much you'll be partying then
you don't want that, neither do i, i don't want to flip when i see you with guys
too much pride, between you and i
not a jealous man, but females lie
but i guess that's just what sluts do, how could it ever be just us two
i'd never love you enough to trust you, we just met and i just fucked you...

<i>[pre-chorus]</i>
but i do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
saturday through sunday, monday, monday through sunday yo'
maybe i'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'...

<i>[chorus b]</i>
cause, i know you want me baby, i think i want you too (cry me a river, cry me a river-er)
"i think i love you baby", i think i love you too (cry me a river)
i'm here to save you girl, come be in shady's world (cry me a river-er)
i want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl
you know you want me baby, you know i want you too (cry me a river)
they call me superman, i'm here to rescue you (cry me a river-er)
i want to save you girl, come be in shady's world (cry me a river)
"ooooh boy you drive me crazy", bitch you make me hurl... (cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah)

<i>[verse three]</i>
first thing you say, "i'm not fazed, i hang around big stars all day
i don't see what the big deal is anyways
you're just plain old marshall to me"
ooh ya' girl run that game
"hallie jade, i love that name, love that tattoo, what's that say?"
"rot in pieces, uh, that's great."
first off you don't know marshall, at all so don't grow partial
that's ammo for my arsenal, i'll slap you off that barstool
there goes another lawsuit, leave handprints all across you
good lordy whoadie, you must be gone off that water bottle
you want what you can't have, ooh girl that's too damn bad
don't touch what you can't grab, end up with two backhands
put anthrax on a tampax, and slap you till you can't stand
girl you just blew your chance, don't mean to ruin your plans...

<i>[pre-chorus]</i>
but i do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
saturday through sunday, monday, monday through sunday yo'
maybe i'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'...

<i>[chorus b]</i>
cause, i know you want me baby, i think i want you too (cry me a river, cry me a river-er)
"i think i love you baby", i think i love you too (cry me a river)
i'm here to save you girl, come be in shady's world (cry me a river-er)
i want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl
you know you want me baby, you know i want you too(cry me a river)
they call me superman, i'm here to rescue you (cry me a river-er)
i want to save you girl, come be in shady's world (cry me a river)
"ooooh boy you drive me crazy", bitch you make me hurl... (cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah)

<i>[chorus a]</i>
cause i can't be your superman (cry me a river)
can't be your superman 
can't be your superman (cry me a river-er)
can't be your superman
i can't be your superman
can't be your superman (cry me a river)
can't be your superman
your superman, your superman... (cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah)

<i>[outro]</i>

(cry me, cry me)


let's take them back to the future (bars)
bars, like paul rosenberg
the small frozen turd (don't censor me man)
alright look, i had class, i just got expelled
i excelled at nothing in school
so if you're tryna test my patience it just failed
but king mathers, i still get hailed
so call me sire, like i exhaled
after i had a deep ass breath held
i guess well, that'll make my size double xl
so kiss your highness's hinded ass
while i'm trying to stretch, it's time to exercise
i'm flexing, isometrics
twice the reps 'til i get extra-sized
and set my bis and pecs and triceps on fire
cause i'm coming out guns blazing
like flaming pythons, my suggestion is parental discretion
be advised, due to this mental aggression
we advise you to back up, like byron leftwich
i'm infectious, i rhyme like i got a sinus infection
a virus, i'm congested and i just ingested
five allegras but the side effects from these anti-depressants, they're tryna mess with my mind
i'm a regular hyde and jekyll
white with freckles but i silence hecklers
you might wanna head for the fire exits
i'm coming through like a wrecking ball
you would swear i think highly of miley
and i respect her, the way i backhand her
excuse my french, montana, but i am worried about nutting
god damn it, i'm a sexist, i drive a lexus
textses out of her mind, and i'm in texas
with a chainsaw, wait, what did i forget this
time, oh, my machetes getting upset, he said
he was ready for me to come get him from inside the shed
it was time, he's restless
he wants to make blood shed like a storage unit
but before i do it, let me think this through
cause if i behead this bitch then i'd be headless
mic check, one, two
i ain't barely check the mic just yet
and i just sweared like twice as many times
in less than ninety seconds
than andrew fucking dice ever did in his fucking life
but i guess i'm expected to make these kinds of violent records
it's why i keep rhyming reckless
fuck it, i swear, like a diamond necklace
since freestyling over phone tap, my line's connected
with rhymes that kept in touch with the fans, that's why the more bars, the better my reception
and i give a fuck about sales, and fuck pop, i don't even like refreshments
cindy crawford tryna fend me off with a bendy straw
at the waffle house, awful mouth
but if you don't like what i'm talking about then block me out
just then foxy brown, walks up and knocks me down
kicks me and socks me, ow
apparently still mad over what i said last year
on that vegas track, i just look stupid and stand there
and try to act like i can't hear
what? sorry dear, but i think pam grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear
that's when my man denaun porter ran behind me to pantomime
that if you wanna kick his ass, stand in line
hands inside my pants as i fantasize taking advantage
of brandy and janet by grabbing my spanish fly
like a blind hispanic guy with his zipper stuck
give a fuck, it's all part of my grand design
to get amanda bynes to come and fucking blow me like a dandelion
better watch your step, you 'bout to cross an outlandish mine
i'm what you get if aaron hernandez rhymed
so stand aside unless you plan to find out how handy i am with a branding iron
fuck talking clear so you all can hear
i'd rather rap like a fucking auctioneer
fuck around and walk from here to the southpaw premier
get on paul's back, rapping paul revere
so call me queer, cause i'm always weird
so praise a genius, hope this don't get taken out of text
but hillary, i promise to wipe my server clean if you face subpoenas
got a name that speaks for itself like anthony weiner
hands in between my pants in a theater, jacking my meat
a fan of trina, angelina, and christina and serena and selena
scarlett johansson, tiffani amber thiessen
give me a damn good reason and not wanna slip an ambien in the cappuccino
and try to have a three-sum with janet reno
i'm fucked worse than donald trump
on lexapro in mexico across from a texaco in mcdonald's drunk
broke and out of gas, busted water pump
getting fondled up by ronald, feeling him on his rump
oh yeah, and me and alyssa milano hump
we do
bringing the horror to emcees like the aura of the run dmc fedora
addidas and diadoras but i need at least three to four of those rita oras
in a four seater taurus but tell them my face is the best seat in the house
i'll let them bleed in my mouth while i'm eating them out (that's disgusting, ow jesus)
heat seeking missile, duck, demented, sick, hate and see who gives a fuck
i invented prick, and that's a true statement, i see the bitch in you caitlyn
i keep the pistol tucked like bruce jenner's dick
no disrespect though, not at all, no pun intended, that took a lot of balls (ay god damn)
oh and azealia banks just wanna tell you thanks
now i got trailer skanks sending me ballpark franks in the mail as pranks
and hot pockets, thanks a lot
awful, i made monopoly off misogyny
sodomy, how many chocolatey jell-o pops can he possibly lace, walking atrocity
no wonder you scoff at me, it's still obvious i'm as off-putting as bill cosby is
treat women like property, possessive like a noun with an apostrophe
s's, i'd probably stalk broccoli, yes it's
socrates with a block of cheese and a dollar stuck in this soda pop machine
got emcees dropping to knees, copping a plea bargain
they keep sobbing, like, âplease stop itâ
aftermath, bitch, still detoxing
looking for us? we over here
like we're eavesdropping


well jimmy moved in with his mother
cos he ain't go no place to go
and now i'm right back in the gutter
with a garbage bag that's full of clothes

cause you live at home in a trailer
what the hell you gonna do (yee-hah!)
cause i live at home in a trailer
mom i'm coming home to you

well my name is jimmy
he's name's greg buehl
me and him and you, - we went to the same school
this ain't cool... i'm in a rage
he's tapping my mom and we're almost the same age
on the microphone i drop bombs
look at this car... 'thanks a lot, mom!'
"here and happy birthday rabbit! here's a brand new car, you can have it. a one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-eight delta..."
this shit won't even get me to the shelter
and i can't even say i'm from mowtown
cause i'm back in the eight hundred and ten now

cos i live at home in a trailer
mom i'm coming home to you


it's not about lyrics anymore, it's about a hot beat and a catchy hook

<i>[eminem]</i>
if we gotta dumb down our style and abc it
then so be it
.cause nowadays these kids, jeez
don't give a shit about lyrics
all they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
long as they can go to the club and get blitz
pick up some chicks and get some digits
and the dj's playing them hits
oh, this my jam, this my shit
we don't know a word to a verse,
all we know is the chorus
'cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
and the songs ginormous, the whole formula's switched
'cause we don't know anymore, what are hits
is it the beat, is it the rap?
is it a finger snap or the same eight hundred and eight clap?
and how do we adapt and get trl votes
when thirteen year olds control the remote
and ashley's got a brand new nose
we gotta put some new emphasis on our syllables

<i>[jay-z]</i>
if the emphasis on the compact disc isn't the beat
than i'm gonna feature em and get rich
and let dre mix the shit and drive off in the range ro
'cause everywhere i go they love the bling bling flow
bang bang look at the way my chain glow
the ring on my fing' cost jermaine a lot of dough, oh
the fuck am i busting my brain for?
it's just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
you call this a lame flow
you bought the shit
i guess you to blame too
i just found the angle
no more reality flow
i'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
cock the mac eleven in front of hot ninety-seven
and call my publicist, tell her, "we're in press heaven"
no one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet
so you want the chat room or the house of malibu, em?
your emphasis is on the wrong syllable

<i>[dr dre]</i>
they said thirty's the new twenty
funny, must mean forty's the new thirty
interesting 'cause ever since then it's been innocence
an extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
of the shit coming out right now
it's all trash
the torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
jay said it's his last and fifty and em
then what? detox drops what we got then
so now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
gambling everytime we put a record out
just looking for that hook

<i>[eminem]</i>
(wait, dre, look)
shorty i love you
and you love me too
we were meant to be 'cause shorty
you love me
and i love you too
and i promise i'll be true to you

<i>[fifty cent]</i>
go shorty, it's your birthday
you made it just in time to hear my wordplay
it's the kid that flip flows who used to flip o's
and run g for days used to see how i get hoes
i'm international, i get my dick licked round the globe
i'm sick right into shows, riding on lolo's
puffing on coco, my bitch in manolo's

sunny bunny money and funny

<i>[stat quo]</i>
there once was a time everywhere he turned
shady aftermath was all you heard

and em got soft
and they say dre just fell the fuck off
well, fuck the "fuck off"s
all y'all eat salt, be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault, oh!
new syllables eat ball, you fucks off's
your house, your bitch i'm getting sucked off
east, south, midwest, even up north
falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
all for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
catch me if you can, i'm running past while y'all walk

<i>[ca$hi$]</i>
shady made me for bringing it back
for the history of rap
it's gone with a snap, a sneer and a clap
what happened to just spitting about living in the motherfucking city you at
in the grimiest condition, i breath in drama
king mathers and cash me, that's freak karma
i'm everything, anything, you could never be
it's a hitting, rhyme in the month deep
i speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
i repeat every evil deed done of mine
no rest contest, contract to sign
by blood i'm in this squad for life
hear out my wind pipes and i just chime
i'm the reason you guys won't say that line
i'm crazy renegade like em and jay-z
i'm rosemary's baby, i want you to hate me

<i>[eminem]</i>
shorty i love you
and you love me too
we were meant to be cause shorty
you love me
and i love you too
and i promise i'll be true to you

<i>[talking]</i>
it is not about lyrics anymore,
it is not about lyrics anymore
it's about a hot beat, a hot beat
it's about a hot beat, a hot beat
a hot, hot, hot beat
and a catchy hook
a hot, hot, hot beat
and a catchy hook
nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are
i don't care if you gotta rhyme smo, joe, toe and glow
now get out there and sell some god-damn records


don't ask me what's up with the hoes
i'm still working the kinks out
love stinks, that explains all this anger that's spillin' out
and i ain't chillin now
i got an oscar, i'm still a grouch
i use it as a doorstop, and the prop
for the broken leg for the couch
yelawolf, shady, tony, touch slaughterhouse
yeah the swat team bout to break them flyswatters out
go to hell in a drought, break ice waters out
nice try, shorty what? we can window shop
the jewelry store

besides only thing i ever had iced out was my heart since i started out
it's f.y.i if ya ain't knowing

oh wait, you want a date oh? well in that case ho it's june eight oh
kinda like beethoven composin' a symphony of hate
so much hate woved into these raps
shit i'm beginning to hate clothing
i hate overalls because they remind me of hoes
for christ sake they're shaped like a h woah, and
you know what else starts with h, though?
hockey, shit thought i had the place flowing
i hate to put you on ice but
you already had three periods in sixty minutes, great going
plus you remind me of cocaine ho
you always in the mirror with your face off
i feel an urge to put you all in a line
and chop you with a razor blade, yo wait
i'm an a-hole, devil with a halo
hell yeah i nailed j-lo, to the railroad
say i won't, better hope you can stay afloat
when i take the wind out your sail boat
i ain't playing yo! go for shady don't kid yourself
bitch, you ain't even a baby goat


now i don't really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
these bitches knew as soon as they saw me
it's never me to get the privilege to know
i roll like a desperado
now i never know where i'm gonna go
still i ball like there's no tomorrow
until it's over and it's all she wrote

you're staring straight into a barrel of hate terrible fate
not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
cupid shot his arrow and missed
wait sarah you're late, your train left
mascara and eggs smeared on your face
night's over goodbye, hoe
i thought that i told you that spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
never shoulda came within range of my rover
shoulda known i was trouble soon as i rolled up
any chick who's dumb enough after i blind-fold her
to still come back to the crib
must want me to mess with her mind
hold up
she mistook me for some high roller
well i won't buy her soda unless it's rock &amp; rye cola
(faygo's cheaper)
buy you a bag of fritos i wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
if you was bleach and i was hair i wouldn't dye/die for you
tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
you get your eyes swoll' up i'm on my straight grizzly
so why would i buy you a gay-ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar

now i don't really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
these bitches knew as soon as they saw me
it's never me to get the privilege to know
i roll like a desperado
now i never know where i'm gonna go
still i ball like there's no tomorrow
until it's over and it's all she wrote

tip told me on this hoe tip
best tip i could give you to hip you
is never to let these tricks trick you
mighty ambiguous of you to think i love you slut, shit
dig you ho
take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
if i should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
like double stick, it's you, but fuck it tip, it's cool
i'm chilling like a villain
like the penguin in its fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
i'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
'fore i tie a fucking knot i'd tie you in one bitch
you think this is some nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
i'll give you some lumps before i split some lump sums with you
so here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger
but a nickel might just get you one pickle
fuck it, it's official so blow the whistle i got a trust issue
there's a bombshell, scud missile
like i just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
like before i rapped i was a motherfucking stud
slut, this'll teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way for shizzle
i still live like i budget a gilbert's lodge check stub, bizzle
so fuck sizzler. this check is a bust like a blood blister

now i don't really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
these bitches knew as soon as they saw me
it's never me to get the privilege to know
i roll like a desperado
now i never know where i'm gonna go
still i ball like there's no tomorrow
until it's over and it's all she wrote

yeah i guess life is a bitch ain't it tip
and each one thinks they the shit
shirt off my back i wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
i'm giving these hoes a dose of their own medicine
let 'em get a good taste of it
i'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
but in case you didn't, iâll stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
life is too short and i got no time to sit around just wasting it
so i pace this shit a little bit quicker
that clock i'm racing it
double timing it, but i still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
that it may take you pricks to catch on
while you strong arm like stretch armstrong
man i still say k-mart's like there's an apostrophe "s" on it dog
and they say mcdonald's isn't a restaurant well i guess i'm wrong
but if you gonna tell me that a&amp;w ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "f" on dawg

now i don't really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
these bitches knew as soon as they saw me
it's never me to get the privilege to know
i roll like a desperado
now i never know where i'm gonna go
still i ball like there's no tomorrow
until it's over and it's all she wrote

all she wrote, all she wrote
i said it's over and that's all she wrote
all she wrote, all she wrote
goodnight, it's over
and that's all she wrote


how the fuck he got an oscar?
passed out in his red mazda
with his fucking head in his pasta
in the parking lot of k-mart plaza
across from the red lobster
looking like the lochness monster
dressed like a cross-dressed mobster
talk is cheap it costs less to gossip
iâd probably be a lot less
hostile if you snots kept your shnozzes out the airholes
or get fucked in all seven holes
ass, mouth, pussy, yeah both ears and hah! yes nostrils
at the ozzfest with nas bumping das efx in wrecked up datsun
and dropped two extra strength watson vicodin out my pocket
they cost less i'm a hot mess cause i tripped and got my head stuck
in a waspâs nest in the process awesome

drunk as fuck
one sock pulling my boxers up with boxing gloves
but i keep dropping my fucking binoculars
got two fucking hydroxycuts and four oxy's stuck in my esophagus
these three lesbian little stocky sluts
thought i swallowed two hockey pucks
started screamin' "serves you right you cocky fuck!
that's what you get for mockin' us
ain't as cool as you thought you was."
bitch all i did when i walked up was have my dick in a sock
and it's a sock puppet so no strings attached you can all suck it
(chick-uh) get it? ah fuck it
shits about to get hairy as motherfucking chewbacca's nuts
cocksuckers


it's all bad now, man, it's all bad
it's all fucked up now

yeah. ha-ha. new shit. hey yo.
i just want the whole world to know that i did not start this, but i will finish it

coming up
it never mattered what color you was
if you could spit then you could spit,
that's it, that's what it was back
when motherfuckers was straight back-packing
cyphering, fighting for life in this rap
for the mic to get passed
and you psyched and you gassed
and you hype 'cause you last
and you might whoop some ass
if you lost then you lost
shake hands like a man
and you swallowed it,

when the unsigned hype column
in the source was like
our only source of light
when the mics used to mean something,
a four was like you were the shit,
now it's like the least you get
three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
four and a half or five means you're biggie, jigga, nas, or benzino.

shit, i don't even think you realize
you're playing with motherfuckers' lives,
i done watched dre get fucked on the chronic,
probably 'cause i was on it

now you fucked me outta my mics twice i let it slide
i said i wouldn't hold my fucking breath to get a five
shit i was right, i'd've fucking died already trying
i swear to god i never lie

i bet that's why
you let that bitch give me that bullshit review
i sat and took it, i ain't look at the shit we knew
you'd probably try to fuck us with obie and fifty too
fuck a relationship. we're through

no more source with street cred,
them days is dead
ray's got aks to dave mays's head
every issue there's an eight page made men spread
will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
that i am not afraid of this fucking waste of lead
on my pencil,
for me to write some shit this simple

so listen closely,
as i break it down and proceed
this old g's 'bout to get smoked like rolled weed

you don't know me or my motherfucking mother, you motherfucking punk
put me on your fuckin' cover just to sell your little sell-out mag

i ain't mad
i feel bad,
here's an ad,
here's a poster of ray-ray and his dad

you wanna talk about some shit that you don't know about? yeah
let's talk about how you're putting your own son out there
to try to eat off him 'cause you missed your boat
you're never gonna blow, bitch
you're just too old

no wonder you're sore now
lordy you're bored now
i'm pushing thirty
you're kicking forty's door down

bitch, this is war now,
and you'll never beat me
all you do is cheat me
out of quotables
but you know that you'll always see me
on your tv
'cause you gotta stay up 'til three in the morning
to see your video played once on bet

so hee-hee-hee who has the last laugh?
aftermath yeah so on behalf of our whole staff
kiss our ass-hole cracks
we'll never fold or hold back
just know that benzino's wack
no matter how many times i say his name,
he'll never blow jack

you're better off trying to bring r-s-o back
look at your track record that's how far it goes back
it's extortion,
and ray owns a portion
so half of the staff up there is fresh outta jail from boston

bullying and bossing,
dave like a slave
they've completely brainwashed him
and forced him to stay locked in his own office
afraid of the softest fakest wanna-be gangster in new york
and it's pitiful,
'cause i would have never said shit
if you'd have kept your mouth shut

bitch, now what?
hit it, clue. spit it, slay.
new shit, exclusive,
yo lantern, yo whoo kid
you know what to do with this: use it
i'm through, this is stupid,
i can't believe i stooped to this
bullshit to do this...

and who you're calling a bitch, bitch?
you owe me.


it's the calm before the storm right here
wait, how was i gonna start this off?
i forgotâ¦ oh, yeah

that's an awfully hot coffee pot
should i drop it on donald trump? prob'ly not
but that's all i got 'til i come up with a solid plot
got a plan and now i gotta hatch it
like a damn apache with a tomahawk
i'ma walk inside a mosque on ramadan
and say a prayer that every time melania talks
she gets a mouâahh, i'ma stop
but we better give obama props
'cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze
that'll prob'ly cause a nuclear holocaust
and while the drama pops
and he waits for shit to quiet down he'll just gas his plane up and fly around 'til the bombing stops
intensities heightened, tensions are risin'
trump, when it comes to giving a shit, you're stingy as i am
except when it comes to having the balls to go against me, you hide 'em
'cause you don't got the fucking nuts like an empty asylum
racism's the only thing he's fantastic for
'cause that's how he gets his fucking rocks off and he's orange
yeah, sick tan
that's why he wants us to disband
'cause he can not withstand
the fact we're not afraid of trump
fuck walkin' on egg shells, i came to stomp
that's why he keeps screamin', "drain the swamp!"
'cause he's in quicksand
it's like we take a step forwards then backwards
but this is his form of distraction
plus, he gets an enormous reaction
when he attacks the nfl so we focus on that in
-stead of talking puerto rico or gun reform for nevada
all these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather
cause a twitter storm with the packers
then says he wants to lower our taxes
then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips
back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
same shit that he tormented hillary for and he slandered
then does it more
from his endorsement of bannon
support for the klansmen
tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black
and comes home from iraq
and is still told to go back to africa
fork and a dagger in this racist ninety-four-year-old grandpa
who keeps ignoring our past historical, deplorable factors
now if you're a black athlete, you're a spoiled little brat for
tryna use your platform or your stature
to try to give those a voice who don't have one
he says, "you're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!"
unless you're a pow who's tortured and battered
'cause to him you're zeros
'cause he don't like his war heroes captured
that's not disrespecting the military
fuck that! this is for colin, ball up a fist!
and keep that shit balled like donald the bitch!
"he's gonna get rid of all immigrants!"
"he's gonna build that thang up taller than this!"
well, if he does build it, i hope it's rock solid with bricks
'cause like him in politics, i'm using all of his tricks
'cause i'm throwin' that piece of shit against the wall 'til it sticks
and any fan of mine who's a supporter of his
i'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against
and if you can't decide who you like more and you're split
on who you should stand beside, i'll do it for you with this:
fuck you!
the rest of america stand up!
we love our military, and we love our country
but we fucking hate trump!


<i>[intro: eminem]</i>
only reason i dissed you in the first place

and that goes for nick too, faggot you think i'm scurred of you?
you're gonna ruin my career you better get one

and only spread her legs to let me hit once
yeah, what you gonna say i'm lucky? tell the public 
that i was so ugly that you fuckin had to be drunk to fuck me?
second base, what the fuck you tell nick pumpkin?
the second week we were dry humpin, that's gotta count for somethin

and don't you dare say it isn't true
as long as that song's gettin airplay i'm dissin you

i just think this shit is funny when i pounce you on a rhyme
but fuck it now i'm 'bout to draw the line
and for you to cross it that's a mountain that i doubt you wanna climb
i can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
on an episode of "cribs," a blow below the ribs
if i hear another word so don't go openin your jibs
cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
i ain't sayin this shit again hoe, you know what it is
it's a warnin shot, 'fore i blow up your whole spot
call my bluff and, i'll release every fuckin thing i got
including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
when me and luis were tryin to stick two cd's in the same slot

<i>[interlude]</i>

<i>[eminem]</i>
nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands we are dealt
we have to take these cards ourselves
and flip them. donât expect no help
now i could have 
either just
sat on my ass
and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which i am placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid
to wait by the door and pack his bags
who sat on the posch hoped and prayed 
for a dad to show who never did
i just wanted to fit in
at every single place
every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it means acting stupid
aunt edna always told me
keep making
that face itâll get stuck like that
meanwhile i am just standing
there holding
my tongue tryna talk like this
till i stuck my tongue 
on that
frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
i learned my lesson then
cauz i wasnât tryna impress my friends no more
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
cauz where you see it from where you are sitting
its probably one hundred and ten% different
i guess we would have to walk a mile
in each others shoes
at least 
what size you wear??
i wear tens
letâs see if you can fit your feet

<i>[chorus]</i>
i am going up
i am going all the way through the fire
i get up and go higher 
so please donât bring me down
and nothing is gonna bring me down
i am going all the way thru the fire
i will get up and then go higher
so please donât knock me down
and nothing is gonna knock me down


sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
when you feel weak, you feel like you just wanna just give up
but you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.

<i>[verse: eminem]</i>
till i collapse i'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
till the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killin' 'em
cause when i am not, then i'm a stop pinnin' 'em and
i am not hip-hop and i'm just not eminem
subliminal thoughts, when i'm a stop sendin'
'em, women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not
get the illin' to stop, amoxacillin's just not real enough

<i>[verse: fifty cent]</i>
now don't think i won't hit you, cause i'm popular
i got a p-ninety-roog that'll pop at ya
catch you slippin' i'm a give ya what i got for ya
my clip loaded for sixteen shots for ya
ya'never had a hot gun on ya waist or blood on ya shoes
cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you
homie you ain't been through
what i been through
you not like me
and i'm not like you
i'm like a animal when i spit it's crazy
got semi-autos that put wholes in niggas tryna play me
one shot is not enough, you need at least an oozie to move me
after four bottles of don
the kid start feelin' woozie
i write my life
you write what you've seen in gangsta movies
i'm gangsta to the core, nigga you can't move me
i find my space at the top
i got this rap shit locked
i've never heard of you
you've heard of me, i'll murder you
spit shells at your convertable
as long as you notice
richard poor hallows still go through ya door
this is war
you scared of me
your not prepared for me
the kid is back
fifty cent i know you like that

<i>[verse: eminem]</i>
the criminal cop killin' hip-hop villiana
minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
your comin' with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
like i showed ya the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot lyrics to shock,
is it a miracle
or am i just a product of pop fizzin' up?
fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot
listen up,
you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck

<i>[verse: eminem]</i>
music is like magic, there's a certain feelin'
you get when you're real, and you spit and people are feelin' ya shit
this is your moment,
and every single minute you get try'n hold on to it
'cause you may never get it again
so while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over
just admit when it's at it's end
'cause i'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
i got a list
here's the order of my list that it's in -
it goes reggie, jay-z, tupac... <i>[echoes]</i>

<i>[verse: twopac]</i>
where my thugs at
huh, increase the doses, bustin whoever closest
thug livin, hell or prison, never losin my focus
i'm makin money moves manditory
in a discussion my past records tell a story
picture niggaz we rushin and still bustin
til the cops come runnin, duck in abandoned buildings
ditchin my gun, homeboy the motherfuckin villain
i live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legit list
so i laugh til i cry, when the law come get me
no baby momma drama, nigga miss me, why plant seeds
in a dirty bitch, waitin to trick me, not the life for me
livin carefree, til i'm buried - and if they dare me
i'm bustin on niggaz until they scurry, i'm clearly
a man of military means in my artillery
watchin over me through every murder scene
from adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
sellin dope to all the fiends, at times i wanna cry
and still, we try to change the past, in vain
never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed
of cocaine, the product of the devil, am i sellin my soul?
got tired of small time livin, niggaz tellin me no
i got mine, fuck them other suckers, that's the mentality
jealous-ass bustaz <i>[xtwo]</i>
i know you niggas been waiting for this shit for a long time
well here it is nigga here it is

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse: twopac]</i>
no insanity plea for me, i ride the beef til i burn
sensimilla bar your kids from the lessons i learned
and in turn i'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social
niggaz shakin like they caught the holy ghost when i approach em
try to politic, before i smoke em, like sun zu
niggaz do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
and if the cops come arrest me in the evening
best believe they comin for my dogs in the mornin
and if i die by a slug, the death of a true thug
tell me will my niggaz mourn me? gettin blowed out
high, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
strikes, walkin close to my third, i live a trouble life
and if you dream be a part of my team
from long beach to queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends
keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustaz

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse: eminem]</i>
soon as a verse starts i eat at an mcs heart, what is he thinkin'
about to go against me?, smart
and it's absurd how people hang on every word
i'll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i'll never be served, my
spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth
that would be the death of me first
'cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin' could
ever be worse that's why i'm
clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic, i act like
i'm an addict
i rap like i'm addicted to smack,
like i'm kim mathers
but i don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a full blown attack i'm launchin'
at them, the track is on some
battlin' rap who wants some static
'cause i don't really think that the fact that
i'm slim matters
a plaque and platinum status is wack if i'm not the baddest

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[outro: eminem &amp; nate dogg]</i>
until the roof, (until the roof)
the roof comes off (the roof comes off)
until my legs, (until my legs)
give out from underneath me,
i, i will not fall,
i will stand tall
feels like no one can
beat me


<i>[eminem]</i>
yo, speed racer, ninety-seven' burgundy blazer
wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer
i'm on some low ish, 
i'm fed up wit the being broke ish
i'm not to joke wit
bitch, i don't sell crack, i smoke it
my brains dusted; i'm disgusted at all my habits
too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets
loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause i'm always too blunted
walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' like, "who want it?"
thug and crook; every drug in the book i've done it
my nine's at your frame,is that your chain? run it
who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor?
aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your progressive pager
spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
stole your mom's acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her
( right right right ! ! ! ) (( ding ! ! ! ))
the doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics 
i'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you, 
and i'ma make sure you come back for it
so barricade your infants, put up some extra fences
a woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses ( ooh )
..take em' on long vacation trips
kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships
mess up your face and lips
slit your stomach and watch your gut split
gut you wit that razor that i use to shave my nuts wit ((laughter))
mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone
i'm so high, i don't even know what label i'm on
i'm messed up, feelin' like an over worked plumber
i'm sick of the crap, what's dr. kevorkian's phone number? ( ha.. hot )


<i>[eminem talking]</i>
yeah yeah
tricky
let's show 'em some love
welcome to detroit

<i>[chorus - eminem]</i>

<i>[verse two - trick trick]</i>
homie it's been a long time comin' and i'm straight with that

my bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
my name is trick trick, head of the goon squad
and gangsta been bangin' the underground since 'ninety-five, we're bangin'
elected to be the villain and certified a menace
holdin' it down since i paroled up outta prison
you heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
all the treacherous, evil deeds of the d you never see
pickin' that kid up in the game, i just wasn't chasin' the fame

accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
a quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
and my boy holdin' me up, shady done put it out
trick trick and eminem, detroit back in the house

<i>[chorus - eminem]</i>

<i>[verse three - trick trick]</i>
ayo em, you ever need one of these weapons come get it
from now on every beef that you get in, homie i'm in it
i been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
i been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
so it's evident, it's time for trick to get it fast
the public, see they appreciate my criminal past
authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
i'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
and i freak from the precinct for violent crimes
i ain't sayin' the shit that i'm sayin' so girls can fear me
only speakin' on what i know so the world can hear me
so peace to jimmy and dre for signin' my nigga
he reached back to detroit and grabbed a winner
so the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
and beat the hell outta anybody that fuck with us

<i>[chorus - eminem]</i>

<i>[outro]</i>

<i>[introduction:]</i>
â i remember... the first time i came here, it's been a rough six years,
and i'm just happy to not be that person anymore and so as my wife.
thank you for letting me do this.
that's all i have to share right now.
â is there anyone else who would like to share with us tonight?
<i>[eminem:]</i> uuh yeah.
<i>[eminem:]</i> my name is marshall.
<i>[crowd:]</i> hello marshall.

<i>[eminem:]</i>
yeah...
it's my life...
my own words i guess...

<i>[verse one]</i>
have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
when they know they're your heart
and you know you were their armour
and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
but what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
and everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
what happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"daddy look what i made", dad's gotta go catch a plane
"daddy where's mommy? i can't find mommy where is she?"
i don't know go play hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
i'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
and put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
that's slim shady, yeah baby, slim shady's crazy
shady made me, but tonight shady's rocka-by-baby...

<i>[chorus]</i>
and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
just smile back
and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
just smile back...

<i>[verse two]</i>
i keep having this dream, i'm pushin' hailie on the swing
she keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"you're making mommy cry, why? why is mommy crying?"
baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, "daddy you're lying
"you always say that, you always say this is the last time
"but you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine"
she's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
"daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!"
goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
it's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe daddy, take it withcha'"
i look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
these fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man i can hear 'em
they're saying "you've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight
now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
and just as i go to walk out of my bedroom door
it turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
and i'm singing...

<i>[chorus]</i>
and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
just smile back
and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
just smile back...

<i>[verse three]</i>
sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
the curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
i take a bow and thank you all for coming out
they're screaming so loud, i take one last look at the crowd
i glance down, i don't believe what i'm seeing
"daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,"
but baby we're in sweden, how did you get to sweden?
"i followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
"you lied to me dad, and now you make mommy sad
"and i bought you this coin, it says 'number one dad'
"that's all i wanted, i just want to give you this coin
"i get the point - fine, me and mommy are going"
"but baby wait,
"it's too late dad, you made the choice
"now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
that's what they want, they want you marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
it's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
yeah, i bet you will. you rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
i hear applause, all this time i couldn't see
how could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
i turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
put it to my brain and scream "die shady" and pop it
the sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that i was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
that's when i wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
it's spring and hailie's outside swinging, i walk right up to kim and kiss her
tell her i miss her, hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
almost as if to say..

<i>[chorus/outro]</i>
and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
just smile back
and when i'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
just smile back...

<i>[ending:]</i>
<i>[eminem:]</i> thank you, thanks for letting me share.


<i>[hook: anna]</i>
keep on going, you just gotta fight it
keep on going cause it's not too late
you can't back down, you can't back down
<i>[twox]</i>

<i>[verse one:]</i>
they ask me am i ok. they ask me if i'm happy
are they asking me that because of the shit thats been thrown at me
or am i just a little snappy
and they genuinly care
doody, most of my life its just been me and you there
and i continuosly stare at pictures of you
i never got to say i love you as much as i wanted to but i do
yeah i say it now and you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now
but somehow i know you're near me in presence
or i went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
and dawg you'll never believe this
but sharonda actually talks to me now
jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
man how you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
if its true, how the fuck am i supposed to get over you
difficult as it sounds

<i>[hook: anna]</i>
keep on going, you just gotta fight it
keep on going cause it's not too late
you can't back down, you can't back down
<i>[twox]</i>

<i>[verse two:]</i>
doody, thats what we call eachother
i don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
we was always brothers
never thought about eachothers skin colours
til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
it was like ninety degrees, i was catching a sun burn
tryna walk under the trees
just to give me some comfort
i'm moaning i just wanna get home
when i look over and his shirt is off
i'm like you gon fry and like
"no i wont, i'm black stupid
black people they got melatonin
in their skin, we don't burn"
meanwhile, my face is glowing and i felt
like i'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughing at me
and snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
and i still have to get you back for that shit
and by the way them playboy rings
my mother stole from you
well nate finally got em back shit
it must have been at least sixteen years ago
well i put em in your cask-owww
moving past it, it still aint registered yet
but you can bet you're legacy they'll never forget
the motor city mo-town
hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads
it don't stop there
yeah, as difficult as it sounds

<i>[hook: anna]</i>
keep on going, you just gotta fight it
keep on going cause it's not too late
you can't back down, you can't back down
<i>[twox]</i>

<i>[verse three:]</i>
and this may sound a little strange but i'mma tell it
i found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and i picked it up to smell it
i wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass
and hang up in the hallway so i can always look at it
and as for all of me and dtwelve we feel like fuck rap
it feels like our general just fucking died in our lap
we shut off all our pages,
all our cell numbers is changed
our two-ways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and i know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is there all still here and you ain't
purple gang, you gotta pressing on
don't ever give up the dream dog
i got love for you all
and doody, it's true you bought people together who never
woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker doody
i know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation
and truly hated the feuding
but you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
if it had to happen, it had to happen
believe me, i know you're the one who taught me to
throw them balls back on dresden
from making cars to paintballing
getting arrested
to sitting across from eachother in cells laughing and jesting
they tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
i guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality, left sweating
me, you and whats his face
i forgot his fucking name
shame he even came to your funeral
he betrayed our team
and if i see him again i'ma punch him in the fucking face
and thats on hallie jade, whitney lane and alaina's name
i let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
for you and pour some liquor out for you with obie in the parking lot of fifty-four
just before we were supposed to get in cars
to come and see you once more
difficult as it sounds

<i>[hook: anna]</i>
keep on going, you just gotta fight it
keep on going cause it's not too late
you can't back down, you can't back down

<i>[verse one:]</i>

remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
gazelle shades, and corn braids
pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews
with the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues
turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
niggaz is gettin smoked g, believe me
talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project
hallways, shootin dice all day
wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
we get hype and shit and start lifin shit
so step away with your fist fight ways
motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though

<i>[verse two:]</i>

no more cocoa leave-io, one two three
one two three, all of this to me, is a mystery
i hear you motherfuckers talk about it
but i stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
and i'm down with the shit too
for the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kung-fu
instead of a mac-ten he tried scrappin
slugs in his back and, that's what the fuck happens
when you sleep on the street
little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep
and we comin to the wake
to make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake
back in the days, our parents used to take care of us
look at em now, they even fuckin scared of us
callin the city for help because they can't maintain
damn, shit done changed

<i>[verse three:]</i>

if i wasn't in the rap game
i'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
because the streets is a short stop
either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
shit, it's hard being young from the slums
eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from
and now the shit's gettin crazier and major
kids younger than me, they got the sky grand pagers
goin outta town, blowin up
six months later all the dead bodies showin up
it make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
but i gotta go identify the body
damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
everytime i turn around a nigga gettin took out
shit, my momma got cancer in her breast
don't ask me why i'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed


yeah. motherfuckers better know... huh, huh
i'm a bad bad bad
lock your windows, close your doors
biggie smalls
huh...yeah
i'm a bad bad bad

my man inf left a tec and a nine at my crib
turned hisself in, he had to do a bid
a one-to-three, he be home the end of 'ninety-three
i'm ready to get this paper, g, you with me?

motherfucking right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
and i'm stressed, yo biggie let me get the vest

no need for that, just grab the fucking gat
the first pocket that's fat the tec is to his back
word is bond, i'mma smoke him yo don't fake no moves (what?)
treat it like boxing: stick and move, stick and move

nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
i've been robbing motherfuckers since the slave ships
with the same clip and the same .forty-five
two point-blank, a motherfucker sure to die
that's my word, nigga even try to bogart
have his mother singing "it's so hard..."

yes, love, love your fucking attitude
because the nigga play pussy that's the nigga that's getting screwed
and bruised up from the pistol whipping
welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
then i'm dipping up the block and i'm robbing bitches too
up the herring bones and bamboos
i wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
give me the baby rings and the number one mom pendant

i'm slamming niggas like shaquille, shit is real
when it's time to eat a meal i rob and steal
'cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
so for the bread and butter i leave niggas in the gutter
huh, word to mother, i'm dangerous
crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
when i bust my gat motherfuckers take dirt naps
i'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

when he's sticking you and taking all of your money

gimme the loot, gimme the loot! (i'm a bad, bad man)
gimme the loot, gimme the loot! (i'm a bad, bad man)
gimme the loot, gimme the loot! (i'm a bad, bad man)
gimme the loot, gimme the loot! (i'm a bad, bad man)
(what's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)

gimme the loot, gimme the loot! (i'm a bad, bad man)
gimme the loot, gimme the loot! (i'm a bad, bad man)
gimme the loot, gimme the loot! (i'm a bad, bad man)
gimme the loot, gimme the loot! (i'm a bad, bad man)
(what's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)

big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
and i'm shooting niggas quick if you hiccup
don't let me fill my clip up in your back and head piece
the opposite of peace sending mom duke a wreath
you're talking to the robbery expert
step into to your wake with your blood on my shirt
don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
'cause when i lick shots the shits is persistent

huh, goodness gracious the papers
where the cash at? where the stash at?
nigga, pass that before you get your grave dug
from the main thug, .three hundred and fifty-seven slug
and my nigga biggie got an itchy one grip

one in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga peel
before you find out how blue steel feel

from the beretta, putting all the holes in your sweater
the money-getter motherfuckers don't know better
rolex watches and colourful swatches

<i>[verse one:]</i>

so you wanna be hardcore 
with your hat to the back, talkin bout the gats in your raps 
but i can't feel that hardcore appeal 
that you're screamin, baby i'm dreamin 
this ain't christopher williams, still some
mc's got to feel one, caps i got to peel some 
to let niggaz know... that if you fuck with big-and-heavy 
i get up in that ass like a wedgie
says who? says me, the lyrical 
niggaz sayin, "biggie off the street, it's a miracle" 
left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me 
just for niggaz actin shifty 
sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker 
especially when i'm drunk off the liquor 
smokin funk by the boxes, packin glocks is 
natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates 
the funk baby 

<i>[chorus (repeats eightx)]</i>

"i live for the funk, i'll die for the funk" (lotug, chief rocka) 

<i>[verse two:]</i>

all i want is bitches, big booty bitches 
used to sell crack, so i could stack my riches 
now i pack gats, to stop all the snitches 
from stayin in my business, what is this?  relentless 
approach, to know if i'm broke or not 
just cause i joke and smoke a lot 
don't mean i don't tote the glock 
sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen 
until we motherfuckin meet again 
huh, i'm doin rhymes now, fuck the crimes now 
come on the ave, i'm real hard to find now 
cause i'm knee deep in the beats 
in the land cruiser jeep with the mac-ten by the seats 
for the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the (car sirens) 
i'll make you prove that it's bulletproof 
hold ya head, cause when you hit the bricks 
i got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin dick 
the funk baby 

<i>[repeat chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three:]</i>

so i guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side 
how i smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside 
bed-stuy, the place where my head rests 
fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test 
the rocket launcher, biggie stomped ya 
high as a motherfuckin helicopter 
that's why i pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor 
beatin motherfuckers like ike beat tina 
(what's love, got to do)
when i'm rippin all through your whole crew 
strapped like bamboo, but i don't sling guns 
i got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons 
niggaz wanna know, how i live the mack life 
making money smoking mics like crack pipes
it's type simple and plain to maintain 
i add a little funk to the brain 
the funk baby 

<i>[repeat chorus]</i>

and all the niggas in the struggle, you know what i'm sayin'?

uh-ha, it's all good baby bay-bee, uh

it was all a dream
i used to read word up magazine
salt'n'pepa and heavy d up in the limousine
hangin' pictures on my wall
every saturday rap attack, mr. magic, marley marl
i let my tape rock 'til my tape pop
smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
way back, when i had the red and black lumberjack
with the hat to match
remember rappin' duke, duh-ha, duh-ha
you never thought that hip hop would take it this far
now i'm in the limelight 'cause i rhyme tight
time to get paid, blow up like the world trade
born sinner, the opposite of a winner
remember when i used to eat sardines for dinner
peace to ron g, brucey b, kid capri
funkmaster flex, lovebug starsky
i'm blowin' up like you thought i would
call the crib, same number same hood
it's all good

uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh

you know very well who you are
don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
you had a goal, but not that many
'cause you're the only one i'll give you good and plenty

i made the change from a common thief
to up close and personal with robin leach
and i'm far from cheap, i smoke skunk with my peeps all day
spread love, it's the brooklyn way
the moet and alize keep me pissy
girls used to diss me
now they write letters 'cause they miss me
i never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
i was too used to packin' gats and stuff
now honies play me close like butter played toast
from the mississippi down to the east coast
condos in queens, indo for weeks
sold out seats to hear biggie smalls speak
livin' life without fear
puttin' five karats in my baby girl's ear
lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
considered a fool 'cause i dropped out of high school
stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
and it's still all good

uh...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

you know very well who you are
don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
you had a goal, but not that many
'cause you're the only one i'll give you good and plenty

super nintendo, sega genesis
when i was dead broke, man i couldn't picture this
fifty inch screen, money green leather sofa
got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
phone bill about two g's flat
no need to worry, my accountant handles that
and my whole crew is loungin'
celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
thinkin' back on my one-room shack
now my mom pimps a ac' with minks on her back
and she loves to show me off, of course
smiles every time my face is up in the source
we used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
no heat, wonder why christmas missed us
birthdays was the worst days
now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
uh, damn right i like the life i live

i'm living every day like a hustle
another drug to juggle
another day another struggle

i don't wanna live no more
sometimes i hear death knocking at my front door
i'm living every day like a hustle
another drug to juggle
another day another struggle

i know how it feel to wake up fucked up
pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
people look at you like you's the user
selling drugs to all the losers mad buddha abuser

but they don't know about the stress-filled day
baby on the way mad bills to pay
that's why you drink tanqueray
so you can reminisce and wish
you wasn't living so devilish shit

i remember i was just like you
smoking blunts with my crew
flipping oldies sixty-twos
'cause ged wasn't big, i got paid
that's why my moms hate me

she was forced to kick me out, no doubt
then i figured out nicks went for twenty down south
packed up my tools for my raw power move
glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps trying to stop my flow
and what they don't know will show on the autopsy
went to see papi, to cop me a brick
asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it
smoking mad newports 'cause i'm due in court for an assault
that i caught in bridgeport, new york
catch me if you can like the gingerbread man
you better have your gat in hand
'cause man

i don't wanna live no more
sometimes i hear death knocking at my front door
i'm living every day like a hustle
another drug to juggle

i had the master plan
i'm in the caravan on my way to maryland
with my man two-tecs to take over this projects
they call him two-tecs, he tote two tecs
and when he start to bust
he like to ask who's next?
i got my honey on the amtrak
with the crack in the crack of her ass
two pounds of hash in the stash
i wait for hon' to make some quick cash
i told her she could be lieutenant bitch got gassed
at last i'm literally lounging black,
sitting back counting double digit thousand stacks
had to re-up see what's up with my peeps
toyota deal-a-thon had it cheap on the jeeps
see who got smoked, what rumors was spread
last i heard i was dead with six to the head
then i got the phone call
it couldn't hit me harder
we got infiltrated
like nino at the carter
heard tec got murdered in a town i've never heard of
by some bitch named alberta over nickel-plated burners
and my bitch swear to god she won't snitch
i told her when she hit the bricks i'll make the hooker rich
conspiracy she'll be home in three
until then i looks out for the whole family
a true g, that's me blowing like a bubble
in the everyday struggle

i don't wanna live no more
sometimes i hear death knocking at my front door
i'm living every day like a hustle
another drug to juggle
another day another struggle

i don't wanna live no more
sometimes i hear death knocking at my front door
i'm living every day like a hustle
another drug to juggle
another day another struggle

i'm seeing body after body and our mayor giuliani
ain't trying to see no black man turn to john gotti
my daughter use a potty so she's older now
educated street knowledge i'mma mold her now
trick a little dough buying young girls fringes
dealing with the dope fiend binges
seeing syringes in the veins
hard to explain how i maintain
the crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
breaking days on the set no sweat drunk off moã«t
can't bag yet because it's still wet
but when i dry bagging five at a time
i can clock about nine on the check cashing line
i had the first and the third
rehearse that's my word
thick in the game ds knew my first name
should i quit? shit no!
even though they had me scared
yo they got a eight i got a tec with air holes

that's just how the shit go in the struggle motherfucker
hah, come on, what you say?

sometimes i hear death knocking at my front door
i'm living every day like a hustle
another drug to juggle
another day another struggle

stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes

<i>[verse one]</i>

nineteen-seventy somethin', nigga i don't sweat the date
my moms is late so i had to plan my escape
out the skins, in this world of fly girls
tanqueray and hennessy until i cold hurl
ten months in this gut, what the fuck
i wish moms'd hurry up so i could get buck
wild, juvenile rippin' mics and shit
new york new york, ready for the likes of this, uh
then came the worst date, may twenty-onest
two:nineteen, that's when my momma water burst
no spouse in the house so she rode for self
to the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
i'm seein' my death and i ain't even took my first step
i made it out, i'm bringin' mad joy
the doctor looked and said, "he's gonna be a bad boy"

<i>[verse two]</i>

now i'm thirteen, smokin' blunts, makin' cream
on the drug scene, fuck a football team
riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
hearin' the coach scream at my lifetime dream, i mean
i wanna blow up, stack my dough up
so school i didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
mom said that i should grow up and check myself
before i wreck myself, disrespect myself
put the drugs on the shelf?  nah, couldn't see it
scarface, king of new york, i wanna be it
rap was secondary, money was necessary
until i got incarcerated--kinda scary
cseventy-four-mark eight set me straight
not able to move behind the great steel gate
time to contemplate, damn, where did i fail?
all the money i stacked was all the money for bail

<i>[verse three]</i>

ninety-four, now i explore new horizons
mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'
honeys is tantalizin', they freak all night
peep duckin' cops on the creep all night
as i open my eyes and realizin' i changed
not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
and to my niggas livin' street life
learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'
in the streets without a gat?  nah, nigga you're slippin'
if i'm pimpin on the f with weed on my breath
original hustler with the muffler on the tec
respect to the mac's and the ac's
to the freaks in the jeeps, lick shots to my peeps


<i>[intro]</i>

no...fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes, all my
niggas know...junior mafia click, gucci don, you know how we play.
fuckin' skanless-ass bitches. you know how it go boots...i
meet a bitch, fuck a bitch, next thing you know you fuckin'
the bitch.  you just pass it around and shit, pass the shit like
a cold and shit.  fuck'em.

<i>[verse one]</i>

now when i'm fuckin' those jen i'm invincible
don't love no hoe, that's my priciple
'cause uh, bitches come (and uh) bitches go
that's why i get my nut and i be out the fuckin' door
(you know) they might be the one to set me up
wanna get their little brother to wet me up
that's why i tote tecs and stuff to get'em off my case
just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
i don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
and when i see the semen i'm leavin'
bitches be schemin', i kid ya not
that's why i keep my windows locked and my glock cocked
one hoe said, "big, why you so hard on us?
why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?"
thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend bitch
'cause when i like ya, then ya go and fuck my friend bitch
(and you know that ain't right)

<i>[chorus]</i>

you know that ain't right

with a friend of mine   <i>[xfour]</i>

<i>[verse two]</i>

you see, i don't sweat these hoes
i keep'em in flavours like timbo's and jibbo's
bitches just like to play the mary though
(yeah we know, drop the scenario)
it was me, dee, the mpv
the blunts and brew thang, knockin' some wu-tang
m-e-t-h-oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
dee hit the dip, so i can drop my mackadocious shit
light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
needless to speak, the gee's obsolete
don't sleep!  banged the skins in a week
on the creep up the avenue
i seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?
that's my nigga dee, damn he got gee
now she fuckin' him and fuckin' me, see
you know that ain't right

<i>[repeat chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three]</i>

uh...now i play her far like a moon play a star
she still sweat me hard 'cause i'm a rap star
i be cruisin' up the block, i be passin' her
pimpin' hard with the female passenger
and the only time i call her to hang
is when me and dee blunted up, pissy, schemin' on a gang-bang
she should've used her intuition
then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
she's sayin' i dissed her 'cause i'm fuckin' her sister
a message to the fellas, that really gets'em pissed, uh
but she started that fuckin' family
she fucked my man dee, so why she mad at me?
plus your sister look better than you
give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
so break the fuck out like a rash
i'm glad i ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass


<i>[verse one:]</i>

live from bedford-stuyverson, the livest one

gats i pull it, bastards duckin when big be buckin
chickenheads be cluckin in my bathroom fuckin
it ain't nuttin, they know big be handlin
with the mac in the ac door paneling
damagin' mc's, oxygen they can't breathe
mad tricks up the sleeve, wear boxers so my dick can breathe
breeze through in the q-forty-five by my side, lyrical high
and those that rushes my cluthes get put on crutches
get smoked like dutches from the master
hate to blast ya, but i have ta, you see i smoke a lot
your life is played out like kwame, and them fuckin polka dots
who rock the spot?  biggie!

<i>[verse two:]</i>

b-i-g, g-i-e, aka, b.i.g.

also known as the bon appetit
rappers can't sleep need sleepin big keep creepin
bulelts heat-seekin, casualties need treatin
dumb rappers need teachin
lesson a - don't fuck with b-i, that's that, oh i, thought he was wack
oh come come now, why y'all so dumb now
hunt me or be hunted, i got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
to summer sautee, i'm the winner all day
lights get dimmer down biggie's hallway
my forte causes caucausians to say
he sounds demented, car-weed scented
if i said it, i meant it
bite my tongue for no-one
call me evil, or unbelievable

<i>[verse three:]</i>

buck shots out the sun roof of lexus coupe's
leave no witnesses, what you think this is
ain't no amateurs here, i damage and tear
mc's fear me, they too near not to hear me
clearly, i'm the triple beam dream
one thousand grams of uncut to the gut
it seems fucked up, the way i touched up the grill
tryin to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer
the gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
get ready to die, tell god i said hi
and throw down some ice, for the nicest mc
niggaz know the steelo, unbelievable


hello? aw shit, nigga. what the fuck time is it, man?
oh god damn. nigga do you know what time it is?

aw, nigga what the fuck is wrong with you?)

when i die, fuck it i wanna go to hell
'cause i'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
(what you're talking about man?)
it don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
dressed in white, i like black timbs and black hoodies

god'll probably have me on some real strict shit
no sleepin' all day, no getting my dick licked
hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
fuck that shit, i wanna tote guns and shoot dice
(you're talking some crazy shit now nigga)

all my life i been considered as the worst
lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out of her purse
crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
i know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion

she don't even love me like she did when i was younger
(get a hold of yourself nigga)
suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
i wonder if i died,
would tears come to her eyes?
forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

my baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
who's to blame for both of them
(no nigga, not you)

i swear to god i wanna just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
throw the magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
(ok nigga what the fuck)
and squeeze, until the bed's completely red
(it is too late for this shit man)
i'm glad i'm dead,
a worthless fuckin' buddha head
(wait a minute...)

the stress is buildin' up, i can't,
(yo, i'm on my way over there, man)
i can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
i wanna leave, i swear to god i feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
but no you wouldn't understand
(nigga, talk to me please, man)

you see it's kinda like the crack did to pookie (the fuck), in new jack
except when i cross over
(ayo man, ayo man)
there ain't no comin' back
(i'm how i'mma call when i got the car),
should i die on the train track, like ramo in beat street

people at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
(yo where your girl at man?)
my baby mama kiss me
but she glad i'm gone
(yo put your girl on the phone nigga)
she know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on

i reach my peak,
(ayo, you listening to me, motherfucker?)
i can't speak,
call my nigga chic,
tell him that my will is weak.
(ayo come on nigga)
i'm sick of niggas lyin',
(cut that...)
i'm sick of bitches hawkin',
(hey yo...)
matter of fact,
(i don't yo, yo big)
i'm sick of talkin'.
(hey yo chill)

(hey yo big, hey yo big)

(please hang up and try your call again)
(please hang upâis a recording)

ooh regina belle, she'd probably do me swell
jasmine guy was fly, mariah carey's kinda scary
wait a minute, what about my honey mary?

hold your horses, i'mma show you who the boss of intercourse is
sex, i'm taking no losses
even groups like swv and tlc
can't see b.i.g. with telepathy
the recipe, a pinch of hardcore with a gun
pimping ain't easy but it sure is fun
when i bust my nuts i bust 'em one by one
so what's the four-one-one hun?

<i>[intro/chorus: the lox]</i>

can i live til my last day
hittin honies that be na-sty
gettin money in the fast way
and i only care halfway
but i still can't let you pass me

<i>[the lox]</i>
yo what's beef to you, three niggaz with hoodies and bats
that ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
when we came here we cut off all kind circulation
breathin, eatin, the whole situation
when we do our shit we do our shit for real
while you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
i'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
rock top shit you know how the lox get
then you can see me flyin in the bentley cockpit
lox and b-i, hold our grica down for years
gang not, but we been had our black tears
niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got
underground, all above must get shot
you couldn't book me dano, see luciano put the burners
to all y'all, what nigga bring it i'm callin y'all

you already know what it's about when i run up in your house
put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
i give this faggot a french kiss
black gloves, no prints, dark tints
word on the street they ain't heard from him since
you know about life after kicked the kid in
since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
scri-dam the flow is forbidd-en
either you ridin or you dyin cause we swingin iron
lox and poppa, turning niggaz into jim hoffa
who gon stop us, it's your last joint double copper
you gettin money or your runnin from the feds
ain't nothin over here but sixteen and one in the head
and i solemnly swear
that all y'all niggaz out there got a problem this year

<i>[the lox]</i>
before you think of keepin me down, heatin me down
the flow like water get deepe and you drown
with no soul, many niggaz roll with no dough
even the small dunn got a little black hole
your destiny is somethin you can never figure out
niggaz is never happy til there's blood up in your mouth
there's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to play in this?
a lot are dead, how the hell you take the pain?
live with it got money you better get with it
my man had the thug in him did his bid with it
get married to the game but never have a kid with it
advice from the wise, slice the pies
too many schemes divides, when dreams collide
teams provide, war for the street to absorb
stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
only a blind dove'll fall in love with a whore

<i>[notorious b.i.g.]</i>
uhh, uhh, uhh
who the fuck wanna squeeze?
my desert ease make mc's freeze
you wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams
you still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
you just pop wines i must pop nines
genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
you're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
we can hook up, all i see is the future
disrespect, i shoot ya
by the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
i be the mob fiance, about to marry it
illegal transactions in farragut with arabics
why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
my first lp, beef with me is unhealthy
fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
collapsed lung, look how many gats i brung
for them homos, still doin promos
break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shined to glow mo'
nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need for mo'

hah, what, how real is this?
uh, uh, how real is this?
what? uh, what?

<i>[jay-z:]</i>
we push the hottest vs, peel fast
through the city, play monopoly with real cash
me and biggie and the models be shaking they sadiddy ass
and prada be, something you cats got to see

and the watches be all types and shapes of stones
being broke is childish and i'm quite grown
run up in the club with the ice on, me and paisan
scope the spot out, see something nice and i'm gone

you cats is home, screaming the fight's on
i'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watching tyson
same night, same fight
but one of us cats ain't playing right
i let you tell it

people place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
and tell me you won't ball every chance you get
and any chance you hit, we live for the moment
makes sense don't it?

now make dollars
cats pop bottles
bone chicks that favor idalis
and rack up frequent flier mileage

snatch the peighty-nines that we pack in the drawers
and we clap the doors of your acuras

snap like cameras on amateurs
make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours
jig and big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
everybody got a part to play, back to yours

run up in your crib now, crack your doors
watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
play the charts like the beatles, y'all adapt to loss
and toast cristal on behalf of y'all

too bad for y'all, ain't too many as bad as yours
truly, do we, we laugh at y'all
little bastards y'all
uh, uh

we hit makers with acres
roll shakers in vegas, you can't break us
lost chips on lakers, gassed-off shaq
country house, tennis courts on horseback

riding deciding cracked crab or lobster
who say mobsters don't prosper?
niggas is actors, niggas deserve oscars

me. i'm critically acclaimed
slug past your brain
reminisce on dames who coochie used to stink
when we rocked house pieces and puffy gucci links
now we buy homes in unfamiliar places
tito smile every time he see our faces

cases catch more than outfielders
half these rapping cats ain't seen war
couldn't score if they had point game, they lame
speak my name, i make 'em dash like dame

i hit maxipriest at least twelve times in the chest
spinned around, shot the chick in the breast
she crying, head shot's put her to rest
pop open the briefcases, nothing but franklin faces
the spots hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
that's when other guests start to slip in
its time for us to get to dipping
i know them niggas in the range is on they way up
flipping, pistol gripping
i load the clip in
the hallway, got real loud and crowded
they walked right past us

<i>[verse one: notorious b.i.g.]</i>

i remember sellin three bricks of straight flour

got some fishscale, ain't no competition that could sour
got the coke cooked up, a crackhead heaven
in eighty-eight, when kane ruled, with half steppin
a thirty-eight, a lot of mouth, was our only weapon
we was king till the g's crept in
and now i'm missin em

ooh, i'm missin you
tell me why the road turns, why it turns
ooh, i'm missin you
nah nah nah nah nah, oh tell me why why why why

<i>[verse two: notorious b.i.g.]</i>

we work all week, we dancin, play the movies
we rock flatops, our girls rocked doobies
made a killin, even though the d's knew me
eventually, you know they try to do me
fuck it
fed up, my nigga want to take it down south
sick of cops comin, sick of throwin jacks in his mouth
gave him half my paper, told 'em go that route
few months, he got his brain blown out
now i'm stressed
his baby's mother, she trippin, blamin me
and his older brothers, understand, the game it be
kinda topsy turvy
you win some, you lose some
damn, they lost a brother
they mother lost a son

i'm a thug, but i swear for three days i cried
i look in the sky and ask god why
can't look his baby girls in the eye
damn i miss you

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three: notorious b.i.g.]</i>

there was this girl around the way that make cats drool
her name's drew, played fools out they money in pool
people swore we was fuckin but we was just cool
she used to hang while i slang my drugs after school
she'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries
my little sister, the girl was kinda close to me
a little closer than the average girl's supposed to be
far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her
then she started messin with some major players
handled keys, niggas called them the bricklayers
a dread kid, had a baby fore that bitch taya
found out her baby's father cheatin, now drew she gotta slay her
one night, across from the corner store
taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four
squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
the dude lived, what my baby had to die for
we missin her

<i>[chorus]</i>


<i>[biggie:]</i> yeah... fuck you

i need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

<i>[notorious b.i.g.:]</i>
i know he don't treat you like i treat you
time to explain your game is see-through
sex is lethal, i ain't gon' lie
means to get ya back, i ain't gon' try

like this y'all, my girl sucked another nigga dick y'all
light-skinned with the chromed-out six y'all
thought they was creeping, took trips to v-a every third weekend

while you was sleeping, he hit you on the box
sixty-nine code non-stop
should've left ya then, but my heart said not
you knew too much, the relationship grew too much

you knew about the crack vials, means to be trialled
where i hid dough under the bathroom tile
waited for a while, thought you would do the right thing
then things got frightening

peep the scene, sorta like sam rothstein
guess you ginger, huh, go figure
never thought you could be a gold-digger
take my dough and spend with the next nigga

asked my man jigga, my ace boon coon
told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
now i'm like brandy, sitting in my room
pissy drunk listening to stylistics tunes
or the o'jays, thinking 'bout the old days
my nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play

baller, if she beep you, don't call her
guess who i seen, that freak bitch paula
she was asking 'bout ya whereabouts
here's the digits, i know you can wear that out
tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
we'll be all fuckin' tonight, know what i mean?! uh
(i'm fuckin' you tonight)

<i>[lil kim:]</i>
what do ya do when your man is untrue?
do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?
i need another man, in my life

<i>[lil kim:]</i>
'member when you said you would die for me, shit
all of that was just lies to me
motherfucker should've never said bye to me
now you cry for me, like jodeci

it's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
black nasty and mad fat y'all
should've seen the whore, nigga pack your shit
you out the door, oh

what about the fight in the mirage?
i seen ya benz parked outside my sister's garage
said it was your friend rog, bullshit
i ain't gonna keep putting up with the bullshit

and still i, never sweat these bitches
q.b. hanged like plaques on the wall in your pictures
scale them fishes, my love is concrete
stashing your heat in the passenger seat
of the nautica jeep, we've been down for so long
still a bitch like me trying to hold on
teary-eyed, damn a bitch steaming
girls steady screaming, 'kim you need to leave him!'

when i testified in court, couldn't think straight
thinking bout the bitches i fought
over you, you can have the shit you bought
and fuck you, leaving is my last resort

you see nine outta ten niggas, ain't shit
one outta five niggas suck a dick
you're mad at me, too bad she ain't bad as me
should've kept the freak bitch off my canopy

now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
when i sucked your dick, it's like smoking a roach
uh, why go from first class to coach

what do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue?
you cut that hooker off and find someone new
i need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

what do ya do when your man is untrue?
do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?
i need another man, in my life

what do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue?
you cut that hooker off and find someone new
i need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

it's the ten crack commandments what
nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed
to my hustling niggas
niggas on the corner i ain't forget you niggas
my triple beam niggas, word up

<i>[chuck d:]</i>
one two three four five six seven eight nine

ten

i been in this game for years, it made me a animal
there's rules to this shit, i wrote me a manual
a step-by-step booklet for you to get
your game on track, not your wig pushed back

rule number uno: never let no one know
how much dough you hold,
'cause you know
the cheddar breed jealousy especially
if that man fucked up
get your ass stuck up

number two:
never let 'em know your next move
don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence
take it from your highness
i done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips

number three:
never trust nobody
your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
hoodied and masked up
shit, for that fast buck
she be laying in the bushes to light that ass up

number four:
know you heard this before
never get high on your own supply

number five:
never sell no crack where you rest at
i don't care if they want a ounce,
tell 'em "bounce"

number six:
that goddamn credit, dead it
you think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it

seven: this rule is so underrated
keep your family and business completely separated
money and blood don't mix
like two dicks
and no bitch
find yourself in serious shit

number eight:
never keep no weight on you
them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too

number nine shoulda been number one to me
if you ain't getting bagged stay the fuck from police
if niggas think you snitching they ain't tryna listen
they be sitting in your kitchen, waiting to start hitting

number ten:
a strong word called "consignment"
strictly for live men,
not for freshmen
if you ain't got the clientã¨le say "hell no!"
'cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow

follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
if not, twenty-four years, on the wake up
slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
caretaker did your makeup,
when you passed
your girl fucked my man jake up,
heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half of cake up
heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up

crack king, frank wiz-zhite

sucking on the tits!  had the hooker beggin for the dick
and your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick

hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
slit the wrist of little sis
after she sucked the dick, i stabbed her brother with the icepick
because he wanted me to fuck him from the back

anybody step into my path is fucking feeling it!

stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push.. me

everything you can imagine is real man

caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
hey yo biggie tell these niggaz i'ma hit em where it hurts
the big city it don't spare no bodies
call me papichulo, to all the spanish mamis
i'm about ten blunts down, drank three or fo' stouts
seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
hey yo money that's yo' stock, yo bigs pass the glock
i'ma tell him it can happen, don't play me with that rap shit

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[notorious b.i.g.]</i>

biggie smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
the two weed spots, the two hot glocks
hah, that's how i got the weed spot
i shot dread in the head, took the bread and the landspread
lil' gotti got the shotty to your body
so don't resist, or you might miss christmas
i tote guns, i make number runs
i give emcees the runs drippin;
when i throw my clip in the a.k., i slay from far away
everybody hit the d-e-c-k
my slow flows remarkable
peace to matteo

my voice excels from the avenue to jailcells
oh my god i'm droppin shit like a pigeon
i hope you're listenin, smackin babies at they christening

smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
so i grab it, never run, the outcome
is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
or where you're from, west or east coast, squeeze toast
leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
the rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
it's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
it's more than i expected, i thought your jewels was rented
but they wasn't, so run it, cousin
i could chill, the heat doesn't
ran up in your shell about a dozen
you never see bank like frank white
your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate
you 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high

<i>[redman]</i>
yo.. yo yo
i don't brownnose out of town hoes
i'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh

i'm out there, i bought it with george jetson here
your time is near, so get your body dropped off
i stopped trustin niggaz since gotti got caught
it's bricks keep your wrist covered, or piss colored
by the waist got a gun as dark as kris brother
i.c.u., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
i break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
the doc was born with a grenade palm

"this rule is so underrated.." -&gt; <i>[b.i.g.]</i>

slash gorilla, slash illest turned killer

<i>[method man]</i>

mentally my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side
that's infinity -- too many sick niggaz, nickel nines;
bring the remedy -- when you play the field, what's the penalty
unnecessary roughness, career endin injuries for suckers
stuck on stupid, shoot em with a dart like cupid
until they got love for my music
star wars i'm han solo, with three egoes
and three charges, i got to "see-three-p.o.'s"

eyeball blower with no equal, niggaz swingin swords in the war

and who better for the job than biggie?  the notorious
jeee-zus, "unbelievable" rhyme that reaches
and touch individual, small frame buck and change

niggaz knows, not to fuck with my dough
niggaz know not to fuck with this little bro i'm ten seconds hit'n'go

strongest of calibers, is what we only travel wit
you gotta get hit, your man did, so you got a hand in it
extort y'all, once friends, now we gotta cross y'all
you know the niggaz with the biggest balls set the new laws
and flip fours, have em washin drawers while you up north

overhearin niggaz situation, sayin, "like we thought"
sittin on the stand with no remorse

cash in my carharts, it ain't hard to get em

could it be the fame, maybe it's the two benz or

fuckin with, hoes ??
cock sucker beat it while you bleed it on the dashboard

i know how it feel to wake up fucked up
pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
people look at you like youse the user
selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
but they don't know about your stress-filled day
baby on the way mad bills to pay
that's why you drink tanqueray; so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
i remember i was just like you
smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over sixty-two's
cause g-e-d, wasn't b-i-g
i had to get p-a-d, that's why my moms hate me
she was forced to kick me out, no doubt
then i figured out licks went for twenty down south
packed up my tools for my raw power move
glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
and what they don't know will show on the autopsy
went to see papi, to cop me a brick
asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin to hear it
smoking mad newports cause i'm due in court
for an assault, that i caught, in bridgeport, new york
catch me if you can like the gingerbread man
you better have your gat in hand, cause man

<i>[notorious b.i.g.]</i>
i had the master plan
i'm in the caravan on my way to maryland
with my man two-tecs to take over this projects
they call him two-tecs, he tote two tecs
and when he start to bust he like to ask, "who's next?"
i got my honey on the amtrak
with the crack in the crack of her ass
two pounds of hash in the stash
i wait for hon to make some quick cash
i told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
at last, i'm literally loungin black
sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
toyota deal-a-thon had it cheap on the jeeps
see who got smoked, what rumors was spread
last i heard i was dead with six to the head
then i got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
we got infiltrated, like nino at the carter
heard tec got murdered in a town i never heard of
by some bitch named alberta over nickel-plated burners
and my bitch swear to god she won't snitch
i told her when she hit the bricks i'll make the hooker rich
conspiracy, she'll be home in three
until then i looks out for the whole family
a true g, that's me, blowing like a bubble;
in the everyday struggle

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[notorious b.i.g.]</i>
i'm seeing body after body and our mayor guiliani
ain't tryin to see no black man turn to john gotti

<i>[nas]</i>
guns and diamonds
bitches put they tongues where the sun ain't shinin
take ki's til they spot us, snakes flee with consignment
this kid he got his krib rated, police found grams
they locked up, his whole fam; moms sister his old man
nigga bailed his moms out, then he told on his man
now they home, actin like nuttin wrong, hustlin again
he tried to be the next frank white, and escobar
pickin up coke a fiend holds it in a seperate car
cooks it up til it's bright white, cut it tight right
then he slings it to the fiends, lookin like fright night
coppin the motorbikes, the scooters, countin dough on computers
high technology dealers, to the users and losers
half-leg didi, try to swap drug for tv's
stores run out of baking soda from bk to qb
my niggaz die for the cause, .forty-five on the drawer
city laws made by big nas and biggie smalls
bitches, holdin my weight in they titties and drawers
my bitches out of state get bust while they pushin my cars
callin me up, callin me baller, call for they cut
pretty hoes bring me my cash, swallow all of this nut
seats on the bent' stay nasty, push the dash 
for the stash box is where the cash be; watchin for task force
cause i know they comin but i'm reachin my goal
fuck bummin, i'm makin sure i leave this whole game wit somethin
crib in west palms for my dime, crib for my moms
ridiculous, you lookin at the next nicholas barnes, baby

<i>[chorus (repeat to fade)]</i>


<i>[jamaican host]</i>
ladies and gentlemen
we're gonna ask you for some fanfare...the band fanfare because...ladies and gentlemen...sting has always gone ahead of itself.
they have done it again and again and again.
i remember the year they brought in the fat boys they were hotter then ten thousand fire sides.
and if you know...and if you enjoy hip-hop...if you want one of the coldest brothaz out of north america...a brotha that gave you a song like
juicy...
<i>[bigge]</i> uh-huh...
<i>[jamaican host]</i>
you hear a crew in jamaica with something that goes like this
"who the heck is this
paging me in the morning
at the crack of dawning"
<i>[bigge]</i> yeauh! 
<i>[jamaican host]</i>
please welcome...for the first time...in sting ninety-six...please welcome (welcome...welcome)
the notorious....the notorious...b.i.g...aka bigge!


<i>[eminem + {b.i.g.}]</i>
ih.. ih, ih (it has been)
it has been, it has been, it has been
it has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
over bread, men who have bled to death, dead {what?}
strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
money power respect, street cred, yeah
it's scary ain't it? picture yourself goin out as a hero {uhh}
picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
notorious tried to warn us
we watched, so many biggie backed off of {ha ha ha}
biggie's back and 'pac's, landmarks, history in rap
statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
these tragic events, which lead us back
to where we left off on march nineth
to come from such hard knock lifes
and make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
and, once they're on us this is our lives
thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
and he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest {uh-huh}
in this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
it's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin
or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
and applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
to the point that you know that he's gangster
he ain't just say shit, you just believe it

<i>[obie trice + {b.i.g.}]</i>
since b.i.b. taught us niggaz to think big
i'm been about my business since then, so anxious {what?}
it ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for brooklyn
this i took in, sent chills through my skin
vicious, i'm experiencin the same sights as him
it's what excited obie to write these poems
rollin, goin through the same shit he spoken
open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
when _ready to die_ was a sick part of my life {yeah}
palmin that forty-five, plottin to pop my mind
then that crooked eye jamaican i'd so many times rewind
got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
get up out the system, who could give him better signs
no pop of mine could top big poppa rhymes
so possibly i'd be popular huh? {uh-huh}
that's the inspiration i got from my nigga b.i.

<i>[diddy + {b.i.g.}]</i>
i took him from coal to diamond, i molded his mind
enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
i made a frankenstein, my design impressed
backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
critics lashed, said i made a fortune off of his passin {what?}
all i did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
and i'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
the original king of new york, christopher wallace...
this is a promise on diddy's honor, i'm a father t'yanna
and teach her that with all the drama don't even bother...
on repeat, all of your albums play back to back {yeah}
and i visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
an immaculate concept, extravagant progress
bullet wounds left in my heart, i'm yellin "god bless"
regardless to critics yellin that east/west
i seen the game losin, i'm just pressin the reset {uhh}
and when the ressurection of you shines through an individual
lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally!
i'ma pay homage, brooklyn's finest
whether it's queens or harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga!

<i>[just blaze]</i>
welcome to the house of pain, just blaze niggaz

<i>[intro: mary j. blige]</i>
theres no way out, it seems i can't get free
somebody tell me what's happening to me

<i>[notorious b.i.g.]</i>
the country bud got me chocking
i'm on a mission to the point motherfuckers think i'm smoking
yea that sick nigga biggie wit the h-shot fifth
wit the extra clip for that extra shit
don't you know that killing is thrilling
all the blood spilling, is all up on the drug dealing
a broad gangsta my daddy was a thug
had a .thirty-eight wit the hallow point slug
so when he lit shots
niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor
a little nigga tried to squeeze .twenty-two's in my reebok shoes
paying dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's
now i'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
got the mac .eleven's swinging from my shoulder
it's a damn shame i got to put my mom through the strain
i'm living in a house of pain

<i>[twopac]</i>
when the motherfucker dust kicker, who can you trust?
who gave you the heart to see a nigga?
before you bust, my name is spoken on the tongue so many foes
bustin motherfuckers out the blocks and i ain't even go
now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame
from doing fix to bustin tricks out the fucking frame
got these bitches on my jock niggaz on my block
jealous ass suckers got it ducking for my fucking glock
and bustin niggaz ass is to stay alive
skinny ass player watching victim motherfuckers fry
they ask me how i'm living? how i'm a hustler?
bucking busters 'til they die
now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
niggaz got they ak's heading for the bird
aiming at free ass bitches let 'em rain
giving 'em, wettin 'em, welcome to the house of pain

<i>[nas]</i>
mjb, be worried niggaz, yea, nas...

wendy williams say i stayed dust maybe i should
cause these rappers'll have your phone tap like savion glover
and on the west the police corrupt, some are bloods
but these teflon i loaded exploding some mugs
i'm like furious in "boyz in the hood"
but at the drive through i'm ain't running i'm dumping
crazy like a paru and load up, know how nas do
i'm calling henchmen to save shit, to organize a black truth
and we party hard party wit nas
since they ain't no more - mardi gras
and bush won't apologize
i got gangsta hoes kobe bryant scared to sodomize
and .forty-five's for them suckers y'all idolize
ya'll yelling my name but y'all soon die in
trying to portray real but they be ly-in
cause they want the real niggaz to die so they can game
but never that, this ain't never lasting this is the house of pain

<i>[intro: jim jones]</i>
r.i.p big
we some niggaz that's gonna make you proud of this game
smell me? (jones, capo)
cash money (santana)
dipset (lil weezy)
let's ride

cause real g's know the feeling (it's murda)
it's hard body, no remorse for the killing (watch it)
cause real g's know the feeling (it's murda)
it's hard body, no remorse for the killing (weezy)

<i>[verse one: lil wayne]</i>
mad trees and bitches in dungarees
the city under seas, kitchen one hundred degrees
i love that summer breeze, i'll stand in it until it freeze
i'm from another breed, them sss, southern g's
i sip phemetrazine, i lean, i stand tall
i'm mean, i'm mad raw, i'm coming like fastball
steee-rike, yup, so get it right
nigga, one of my sniplets'll end your whole life
you ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife
in a fork, i'm a pig myself, i eat schwork
so be smart and play your own part
if you don't love yourself, i'll make you see your own heart
and we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell
hey, i'ma shoot it out if i'm facing the ail
yea, so tell your girl to come and make me rich
weezy baby nigga, nine to five, ten to six

<i>[verse two: juelz santana]</i>
it's showdown time, throwdown time
same d-off, four pound time
clack clack, go get yours, i'll go get mine
check it man, i'm wit whatever
goodness gracious the paper
where the cash at? where the stash at?
i'll blow that ass back for fronting on a nigga like me
you got nothing on a nigga like me, you'll see
i'm on the grind from sun up to sun down
if i'm lying, may lightning come down and strike me right now
i'll turn a dollar to a twenty to a fifty to a hundred
keep it coming til i'm full on my stomach
i'm stuck in my ways, i'm stuck puffing my hase
hand on my pistol, front of it sprays
i'm stuck living the life of a ghetto nigga
trying to get rid of the life, alright?

cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

<i>[verse one: notorious b.i.g.]</i>
when i die, fuck it i wanna go to (hell)
cause i'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
it don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
dressed in white, i like black tims and black hoodies
god will probably have me on some real strict shit
no sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
fuck that shit, i wanna tote guns and shoot dice
all my life i been considered as the worst
lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
i know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

<i>[verse two: notorious b.i.g.]</i>
i swear to god i just want to (slit) my wrists and end this bullshit
throw the magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
and squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
i'm glad i'm (dead), a worthless fuckin' buddah head
the stress is buildin' up, i can't,
i can't believe (suicide's) on my fuckin' mind
i want to leave, i swear to god i feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
naw you wouldn't understand
you see its kinda like the crack did to pookie, in new jack
except when i cross over, there ain't no comin' back
should i die on the train track, like remo in beatstreet
people at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
my baby momma kissed me but she glad i'm gone
she knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
i wonder if i died, would tears come to her eyes?
forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

<i>[verse three: notorious b.i.g.]</i>
i reach my peak, i can't speak,
call my nigga chic, tell him that my will is weak

<i>[biggie]</i>
niggaz in my faction don't like asking questions
strictly gun testing, coke measuring
giving pleasure in the benz-ito
hitting fanny, spendin chips at manny's
hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
run up in your crib, wrap you up in your polo sheets
six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
muah!, may you rest in peace
with my sycamore style, more sicker than yours
four-four, and fifty-four draw
as my pilot, steers my leer
yes my dear shit's official, only the feds i fear
here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
the kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying
so don't you get suspicious
i'm big dangerous you're just a likkle vicious
as i leave my competition, respirator style
climb the ladder to success, escalator style
hold y'all breath, i told y'all, death controls y'all
big don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)
i spit phrases that'll thrill you, (thrill you)
you're nobody till somebody kills you (i don't wanna die)

<i>[biggie (chorus)]</i>
do you know where your going too
just a memory...everybody dying
when i throw my clip in the ak
may you rest in peace
your nobody till somebody kills you

do you know where your goin too
just a memory...so you better pack a pistol
everybody dying, death controls y'all
your nobody till somebody kills you

<i>[pusha t]</i>
label limbo, i treat it like the wind blows
my back don't bend, see papi is my kenfolk
spin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke
soul benefactor the benz, he made the rims poke
trust me they can't touch p, in one touchie
turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
that carried my niggaz, and had the church mothers cursing
imagine the glamour that comes out the flow
of a nigga who still play in the snow like santa
the wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
and the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)
on the flipside, the steel i'm gripping
you thought all the floss had me slipping?
think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
lead give permanent concussion, your nothing

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[malice]</i>
ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad
on the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
a mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
bentley coupe another short of the arnage
even as a youth i was laudering the stoop
underneath the nose, and the feds had no clue
i was pushing keys in a v with no roof
rich, black, two big guns and no coof
things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
and that pretty much leave malice at the table
or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
because im a provider as long as i am able
this here hughe the most foolish of blues
when i tell my mom the price
she damn near sent me to my room
it's the m-a-l-i-c-i-o-u-s
you don't wanna try nigga, you next uhh

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[diddy]</i>
biggie duets...
born again...
life after death...
legacy lives on..and on, and on
these motherfuckers still can't see you big
shit you ain't even here..
motherfuckers better step their game up..
greatest of all time, greatest of all time!
motherfuckers...

what you expected from his next of kin
i'm loco bro, but ain't no mexican
i got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen
a shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while i'm shittin
the lesson from the smith and wessun is depressin
niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
how many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
and my body start to shake, if i should die before i wake

<i>[korn + (notorious b.i.g.)]</i>
i'm here, i'm watching you (if i should die before i wake)
love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through (if i should die before i wake)
this, can be, reality (if i should die before i wake)
wake, up, my dead face i see (if i should die before i wake)
my dead face i see, my dead face i see!!

<i>[korn electric guitar w/ indistinct shouting]</i>

<i>[notorious b.i.g.]</i>
on your mark, get set, when i spark you're wet
look how dark it get when you're marked wit death
should i, start your breath or should i let you die
if he start to cry, ask why?
lyrically, i'm worshipped, don't front, the word's sick
you cursed it, but rehearsed it
i drop unexpectedly like bird shit
you herbs get, stomped quickly for raw t's and show money
don't forget the publishin, i'm punishin
i'm done wit them, son i'm surprised you run wit them
i think they got cumin, cause they nothin but bitch
tryna blow up like nitro wit dynamite sticks
mad i smoke, but yo i rock diamonds that's sick
got paper off my flow, ride wit my own click
take chicks to cairo, layin wit yo' bitch
i know you playin you was rich
fuck you prick, when i see you i'ma..

<i>[korn + (notorious b.i.g.)]</i>
i am here, i'm watching you (when i see you i'ma..)
love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through (when i see you i'ma..)

wake, up, my dead face i see (when i see you i'ma..)
my dead face i see (when i see you i'ma..), my dead face i see!!

<i>[biggie mom]</i>
lets say many times as i looked and soroow reflexes of my son (biggie) i argue sometimes and saltied i soroow thoughts and said "well done" i thoght of
him (biggie) instinly and slighty ask why i tried formly and just can`t say goodbye i live with visions twin and twisted passion so cold and withored
thoghts batored shattered i dream dreams cherish memory`s house friendships and promise that mattered in the end time is trausured like love for my son
love is everlasting


i was a terror since the public school era
bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezing asses
smoking blunts was a daily routine
since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
i used to have the tre` duce
and the deuce deuce in my bubblegoose
now i got a mac in my knapsack
loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
and sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
honeys want to chat
but all we wanna know is "where the party at?"
and can i bring my gat?
if not, i hope i don't get shot
but i throw my vest on my chest
'cause niggaz is a mess
it don't take nothin' but frontin' 
for me to start somethin'
buggin' and barkin' at niggaz like i was duck huntin'
dumbing out, just me and my crew
cause all we wanna do is...

hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
seen my man sei that i knew from the projects
said he had beef, asked me if i had my peice
sure do, two .twenty-two's in my shoes
holler if you need me love i'm in the house
roam and strollin' see what the honeys is about
moet popping, hoe hopping, ain't no stopping big poppa, i'm a bad boy
niggaz wanna front, who got your back? (biggie!)
niggaz wanna flex, who got the gat? (biggie!)
it ain't hard to tell i'm the east coast overdoser
nigga you scared you're supposed to
nigga i told ya, put fear in your heart
fuck up the party before it even start
pissy drunk, off the henny and skunk
or some brand-nubian shit beatin' down punks!

<i>[chorus]</i>

bitches in the back looking righteous
in a tight dress, i think i might just
hit her with a little biggie one hundred and one, how to tote a gun 
and have fun with jamaican rum
conversations, blunts in rotation
my man big jacques got the glock in his waist and
we're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
if money smell bad than this nigga biggie stinking
is it my charm? i got the hookers eatin out my palm
she grabbed my arm and said "let's leave calm"
i'm hittin' skins again
rolled up another blunt, bought a heineken
niggaz start to loke out, a kid got choked out
blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

<i>[music stops, indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing, 
biggie breaks it up yelling "yo chill, man, chill!"]</i>

can't we just all get along?
so i can put hickies on her chest like li'l shawn
get her pissy drunk off of don perrignon
and it's on, and i'm gone
that's that.

<i>[chorus w/ puff talking after selected lines]</i>

<i>[intro:]</i>
a whole lotta niggaz want big to make a demo tape 'specially that...
bum-ass nigga, uhh!
this goin' out to you nigga recognize
yo fifty, what's this?

<i>[verse:]</i>
microphone murderer, mass mayhem maker
b.i.g.'s on the mic, call the undertaker
make an appointment. - schedule a interview
because you know what big man's about to do.
fifty gran' on the technic - at the right peak
brothers wanna hear the words big man speak!
the microphone i rip it! - the burner got the clip in
slammin mc's like scottie pippen. ("paaaapeerrrr! ")
flippin on old gold, cold as the rhymes you stole
puffin' on dime bags and i been told.
my words are harder than a brick, chinese arithmetic
a thick stick and my dick!
makes me sick when you pick the whick-whack rhyme g
you get what you pumpin' is tic-tac time z.
the b.i.g. moves swifter than a ninja
even on stickups i'm the masked avenger! ("paaaapeerrrr! ")
keep my eyes open and the case closed
no eyewitnesses, no names or expos!
just the heavyset one with the big gun
and a sweet tongue shakin down everyone.
loot like michael jackson kicks like bo jackson
benz like freddie jackson. - no need to ask in the crew!
oooh! - no frontin', no fakin' moves
fightin' or fuckin'. - resort to the stick and move. ("paaaapeerrrr! ")
smack the fool that disagree, recognize the pedigree
rhyme is mine cause i said it's me!
step to a big man grippin the mic stand
keep a bankroll and so do fifty gran'.
and - i give you my hand cause you deserve a pound
tryna blow up the spot - in my part of town.
braves, because you get no praise
i teach you like a {censored} did the a's. ("paaaapeerrrr! ")
recognize, i don't fuck with the st. ides
b.i.g. down with "o.g.b."
"old gold brothers" for the others that missed me
the crew stay deep on bedford and quincy.
rhymes in the pocket for a quick hand to hand,
you want it to be on, there's a tec in the garbage can!
i pull bitches like kim fields, brooke shields
shelley long, connie chung. - i can go on and on! ("paaaapeerrrr! ")
word is bond i'm a don!
i split 'em and run up in 'em i fuck 'em and then i duck 'em.
i hit 'em in the shitter and forget her!
and it gets better! - b.i.g. - are the letters! niggaz know the pedi'...

<i>[outro:]</i>

sometimes in my waist. - if they come opponent
run upstairs, change my skimmer and my coat and
i'm floatin' - to your punk part of town.

want me to drop the drama kid? (yeah!) <i>[beat starts]</i>

<i>[intro two:]</i>
yeah, dedicatin this to you man
cause my man fifty gran' told me straight up and down man
i ain't 'sposed to love no ho!
knahmsayin'?
i tried to tell her fifty!
i got three rules in life!
i'm not to be played with... played on or played out!
i'm a drop it like dis!

<i>[verse one:]</i>
lyin' in my bed. - i'm lookin' at four walls
echo in my head sayin i got a lot of gall.
grippin my cap, my pen in my teeth
thinkin' what this ho said, she called me a: "thief"!
she said i stole her heart. - and didn't leave a trace
i told her i was sorry and she said get out my face.
walked out my door with my walkman in my pocket
playin' +love is a house+! -aand thinkin' how she jocked it.
when she had the key - to open up my door
adore - that prince scam that got me on the floor.
i know that she loved me, i couldn't ever fake it,
i say: "go buy a pie! " - the girl would go bake it.
makin' a record was important to me
more important than her that's what made her flee, see?
the mistake was not payin' no mind
all her posse said we was two of a kind.
i call her back twice. - your sister said you're broke
she said: "when you left, your ears was full of smoke! "
chokin' on a cigarette you don't even smoke
jumped in the train station put in a token.
coulda been my partner, my amigo my peer,
just waitin for them three words that all girls wanna hear.
"i love you! " huh! - you would start to cry if
i would reply with i-l-y!
then i tell your friends - that you played me out
said i wouldn't say: "i love you! " just to make you shout!
so i, call up seven digits that would pick up your phone,
your sister picked it up and said that you wasn't home.
i heard you in the back cryin' up a storm
screamin how you wish that i never was born.
"i hate him! i hate him! " that's what she kept sayin'
she'll come to her senses is what i kept prayin'.
but now i'm gonna lay the cards on the line,

i try to effect by kicking the facts
and stacking much mail
i'm packing a gat 'cause guys wanna jack
and fuck going to jail
'cause i ain't a crook, despite how i look
i don't sell yayo
they judging a brother like covers on books
follow me into a flow
i'm sure you know, which way to go
i'm hitting 'em out of the doors
so slip on the slope, let's skip on the flow
i'm fucking the sluts and hoes
the bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
the gimminy jimminy grows
then whaddaya know, it's off with some clothes
rowd when the crowd says ho
that let's me know, they know i can flow
love when they come to my shows
i get up and go with skins before
when i'm collecting my dough
i never respect, the one that i back
the quicker the nigga can rap
the bigger the check
now watch how they sweat
what kind of style is that?
the style of a mack, and ready to jack
i rendered up piles of black
the wacker the pack, the fatter the smack
i hate it when real niggas bust
they hate when i cuss, they threaten to bust
i had enough of the fuss
i bust what i bust and cuss when i must
they gave me a charge for sales
for selling the tales... of young black males

yes, nigga, n-i-g-g-a, niggas
ay, nigga, you can't handle that shit!
pass that man!
hit that shit, that's the shit!
it smells like skunk, skunk smells like that nigga, momma
we ain't nuttin' but some low down dirty niggas
keep it real, nigga! fuck you, nigga!
you ain't giving me near a dime on this real motherfucker
fuck st. ides, it's an old e thing, baby
strictly some of that hennessy
can i drink with you, fellas? can i get it on it?
fuck you, capo. you ain't in, baby
i tell you what! you guys are not gonna be talking
all that shit, when i come back, ok?
we gonna say who the big mouth, when i come back
young black male!


you know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness, living on the streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me
'cause they never talk peace in the black community
all we know is violence, do the job in silence
walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for the big pen
niggas comin' out worse-off than when they went in
over the years i done a lot of growin' up
getting drunk, throwin' up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route, way out
to money and fame, i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harasses me i just might go psycho
and when i get 'em, i'll hit 'em with the bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the uzi
they got me trapped

uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
they got me trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down

they got me trapped
can barely walk the city streets
without a cop harassing me, searching me
then asking my identity
hands up, throw me up against the wall
didn't do a thing at all
i'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on the concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didn't know this was the wrong street
bang, bang, count another casualty
but it's a cop who's shot for his brutality
who do you blame? it's a shame because the man's slain
he got caught in the chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all the things they did to me?
sweated me, hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day i'm gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me?
i couldn't find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie, don't play that
it's time i let 'em suffer the payback
i'm trying to avoid physical contact
i can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
they got me trapped

uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
they got me trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down

now i'm trapped and want to find my getaway
all i need is a 'g' and somewhere safe to stay
can't use the phone
'cause i'm sure someone is tapping in
did it before
ain't scared to use my gat again
i look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant
but now he's the devil's friend
too late to be tellin' him
he shot first and i'll be damned if i run away
homie is done away, i should've put my gun away
i wasn't thinking, all i heard was the ridicule
girlies was laughin', tup saying, "damn homies is dissing you."
i fired my weapon
started steppin' in the hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin' a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin' for my getaway
coppers said, "freeze, or you'll be dead today."
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldn't see the light
thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
what do i do? live my life in a prison cell?
i'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped

uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
they got me trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down

is it my fault just 'cause i'm a young black male?
cops sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sales
only fifteen and got problems
cops on my tail, so i bail 'til i dodge 'em
they finally pull me over and i laugh
"remember rodney king?" and i blast on his punk ass
now i got a murder case...

keep my shit cocked, 'cause the cops got a glock too
what the fuck would you do? drop them or let 'em drop you?
i chose droppin' the cop
i got me a glock, and a glock for the niggas on my block
momma tried to stab me, i moved out
sold a pound a weed, made g's, bought a new house
i'm only seventeen, i'm the new king
got me a crew, bought 'em jewels, and a uz'-thick

and now i'm in the back of the paddy wagon
while this cop's bragging about the nigga he's jackin'
i see no justice, all i see is niggas dying fast
the sound of a gun blast, then watch the hearse pass
just another day in the life, g

the cabs, they don't wanna stop for a brother, man
but damn near have an accident to pick up another man
i went to the bank to cash my check

the grammy's and american music shows
they pimp us like hoes, take our dough, but they hate us though
you better keep your mind on the real shit
and fuck trying to get with these crooked-ass hypocrites
the way they see it, we was meant to be kept down
just can't understand why we getting respect now
mama told me there'd be days like this

they say we niggas like to do niggas
so me an' a cop are just two niggas

'cause a nigga like p, don't really give a fuck

<i>[twopac:]</i>
walked in the store, what's everybody staring at?
they act like they never seen a motherfucker wearing black
following a nigga and shit â ain't this a bitch?
all i wanted was some chips
i wanna take my business elsewhere â but where?
'cause who in the hell cares
about a black man with a black need?
they wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
i wonder if he knows that my income
is more than his pension, salary and then some
your daughter is my number one fan
and your trife-ass wife wants a life with a black man
so who's the mack, in fact who's the black jack?
sit back and get fat off the fat cat
while he thinks that he's getting over
i bust a move as smooth as casanova

they claim that i'm violent
just 'cause i refuse to be silent
these hypocrites are havin' fits
'cause i'm not buyin' it, defyin' it
envious because i will rebel against
any oppressor - and this is known as self-defense
i show no mercy, they claim that i'm the lunatic
but when the shit gets thick, i'm the one you go and get
don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
'cause i'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
in every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
i'm never ignorant, getting goals accomplished
the underground railroad on an uprise
this time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
i told 'em fight back, attack on society
if this is violence, then violent's what i gotta be
if you investigate you'll find out where it's comin' from
look through our history, america's the violent one
unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
this time the payback for evil shit you did to me
they call me militant, racist 'cause i will resist
you wanna censor somethin', motherfucker censor this!
my words are weapons and i'm steppin' to the silent
wakin' up the masses, but you, claim that i'm violent

"they claimin' that i'm violent."
"fuck the damn cop!"
"just because we play what the people want."
<i>[threex]</i>

the cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
call me a dope man, 'cause i rock dope beats
jacked by the police, didn't have my id
i said, "excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?"
he had the nerve to say that i had a curfew
("do you know what time it is?
get out the fucking car, or i'll hurt you!")
get out the car - or i'll hurt you
so here i go, i better make my mind up
pick my nine up or hit the line-up
i chose b, stepped into the streets
the first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
they grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
(ay man... aiyyo... ay man, just c'mon?)
("what you doing, man?")
they tried to frame me
they tried to say i had some dope in the back seat
but i'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
my homie panicked ("i'm out!") he tried to run 
(freeze, nigga!) i heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
my homie dropped, so i hit the cop
i kept swingin', yo, i couldn't stop
before i knew it, i was beatin' the cop senseless
the other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
(argh, fuck you! ungh!)
now i'm against this cop who was racist
givin' him a taste of trading places
and all this 'cause the peckerwood was tryin' this frame up,
but i came up
now they claimin' that i'm violent

"they claimin' that i'm violent."
"fuck the damn cop!"
"just because we play what the people want."
<i>[threex]</i>

as i was beatin' on a cop, i heard a gun click (uh-oh)
then the gun shot, but i wasn't hit
i turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
he shot the cop (damn!). now he's a dead man
i said, come on, it's time for us to get away
(let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here.)
they called for backup, and they'll be on their way
jumped in the car and tried to get away quick
the car wouldn't start (damn!). we in deep shit
so we jumped out (c'mon, let's take the cop's car)
we drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
but i looked up and all i saw was blue lights
(that's a lotta of one time)
if i die tonight, i'm dying in a gunfight
i grabbed the ak, my homie took the twelve gauge
(yeah, it's on now)
load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray
we'll shoot 'em up with they own fuckin' weapons
and when we through sprayin' then we steppin'
this is a lesson to the rednecks and crooked cops
you fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
so here we go, the police against us
dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust
(what's next, man?) what's next? i don't know and i don't care
one thing fo' sho', tommorrow i won't be here
but if i go, i'm takin' all these punks with me
(pass me a clip) pass me a clip, g, now come and get me
you wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
givin' them a reason to claim that i'm violent

"they claimin' that i'm violent."
"fuck the damn cop!"
"just because we play what the people want."
<i>[threex]</i>


killing us one by one
in one way or another
america will find a way to eliminate the problem
one by one
the problem is the troublesome black youth of the ghetto's
and one by one
we are being wiped off the face of this earth
at an extremely alarming rate
and even more alarming is the fact
that we are not fighting back
brothers, sisters, niggas
when i say "nigga" it is not the nigga we have grown to fear
it is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
but to me it means never ignorant getting goals accomplished, nigga
niggas, what are we going to do?
walk blind into a line or fight
fight and die if we must die, like niggas

this is for the masses, the lower classes
the ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living
but we were kept out
made to feel inferior, but we're superior
break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya
pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
honour a man that refuses to respect us
emancipation proclamation? please!
lincoln just said that to save the nation
these are lies that we all accepted
say no to drugs but the governments' kept it
running through our community, killing the unity
the war on drugs is a war on you and me
and yet, they say this is the home of the free
but if you ask me, it's all about hypocrisy
the constitution, yo, it don't apply to me
and lady liberty? stupid bitch lied to me
this made me strong, and no one's gonna like what i'm pumpin'
but it's wrong to keep someone from learning something
so get up, it's time to start nation building
i'm fed up, we gotta start teach the children
that they can be all that they want to be
there's much more to life than just poverty

this is definitely uh... words of wisdom
america! america! amerik-k-ka
i charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
for suppressing and punishing my people
i charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history
i charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
trapped in the projects
and the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
and you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
prosecutor, do you have any more evidence?

words of wisdom
based upon the strength of a nation
conquer the enemy armed with education
protect yourself, reach for what you want to do
know thyself, teach by what we've been through
armed with the knowledge of the place we've been
no one will ever oppress this race again
no malcolm x in my history text, why's that?
'cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
why is martin luther king in my book each week?
he told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
i don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
i get sweated, they act like asking questions is a crime
but forget it, cause one day i'm gonna prove them wrong
not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
the american dream, though it seems like it's attainable
they're pulling your sleeve, don't believe
'cause it will strangle ya
pulling the life of your brain, i can't explain
beg as you can obtain from which you came
swear that your mother is living in equality
forgetting your brother that's living in poverty
thought they had us beaten when they took out king
but the battle ain't over till the black man sings
words of wisdom
the battle ain't over 'till the black man sings
words of wisdom

nightmare! that's what i am
america's nightmare
i am what you made me
the hate and the evil that you gave me
i shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people
for four hundred plus years
you should be scared
you should be running
you should be trying to silence me
ha, but you cannot escape fate
for it is my turn to come
just as you rose you will fall
by my hands
america, you reap what you sow
twopacalypse, america's nightmare
ice cube and da lynch mob, america's nightmare
above the law, america's nightmare

ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
we been coochie-coo all through school, you and me, g
back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on
all through high school, girls by the dozens
saying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't
but like the old saying goes
times goes on, and everybody grows
grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
you chose the dope game, my microphone pays
in many ways we were paid in the old days
so far away from the crazies with ak's
and though i been around clowning with the underground
i'm still down with my homies from the hometown
and if you need, need anything at all
i drop it all for y'all, if my homies call

"if you ever need a place to stay"
"well, alright, y'all"
"brothers and sisters"

it's a shame, you chose the dope game
now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name
it was plain that your aim was mo' 'caine
you got game now you run with no shame
i chose rapping tracks to make stacks
in fact i travel the map with raps that spray cats
but now i don't wanna down my homie
no matter how low you go, you're not lowly
and i, hear that you made a few enemies
but when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
if you need my assistance, there'll be no resistance
i'll be there in an instant
who am i to judge another brother, only on his cover
i'd be no different than the other
h-to-the-o-to-the-m-to-the-i-to-the-e
i'm down to the e-n-d
'cause it's a fall in no time at all
i'm down for y'all, when my homies call
word, if my homies call

"if you ever need a place to stay"
"well, alright, y'all"
"brothers and sisters"

well, it's ninety-one and i'm living kinda swell now
but i hear that you're going through some hell, pal
but life making records ain't easy
it ain't what i expected, it's hectic, it's sleazy
but i guess that the streets is harder
trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
my homies is making it elsewhere
striving, working nine to five with no health care
we both had dreams of being great
but his deferred and blurred and changed in shape
it's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
to be great, i'm giving it all it takes
trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
i gotta take my place or fall from grace
the foolish way, the pace is quick and great
smiling face to hide the trace of hate
but my homie would never do me wrong
that's why i wrote this song, if you ever need me, it's on
no matter who the foe they must fall
us against them all i'm down to brawl if my homies call

"if you ever need a place to stay"
"well, alright, y'all"
"brothers and sisters"


<i>[dave hollister:]</i>
brenda's got a baby

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i hear brenda's got a baby
but brenda's barely got a brain
a damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
that's not our problem, that's up to brenda's family
well let me show you how it affects our whole community
now brenda really never knew her moms
and her dad was a junkie putting death into his arms
it's sad, cause i bet brenda doesn't even know
just cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
but oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when the check came they got first dibs
now brenda's belly's getting bigger
but no one seems to notice any change in her figure
she's twelve years old and she's having a baby
in love with a molester, who's sexing her crazy
and yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
and dreams of a world where the two of them are together, whatever
he left her and she had the baby solo
she had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so
she didn't know, what to throw away and what to keep
she wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
i guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
she didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
now the baby's in the trash heap bawling
momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her calling
brenda wants to run away
momma say, you making me lose pay
there's social workers here every day
now brenda's gotta make her own way
can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
no money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
she tried to sell crack but end up getting robbed
so now what's next, there ain't nothing left to sell
so she sees sex as a way of leaving hell
it's paying the rent, so she really can't complain
prostitute, found slain and brenda's her name, she's got a baby


<i>[twopac:]</i>
oh shit, jumped on my man's dick
heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick
who's to blame, the guy or the groupie

cause i'm out to show that i'm a dope mc

bitches on my dick like a motherfuckin' condom
niggas wanna flip, let 'em step, and i'll bomb 'em
see somethin' you want, why don't you come and get it
and then get waxed and taxed, like the government
then i leave you sittin' there, wonder where your money went
while your bitch is callin' me, tellin' me to come again
nigga i'm loc'ed, when i smoke, from the indo
but we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
that's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out

rebel... rebel
rebel
rebel... rebel

they just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain
from a man like me, who goes against the grain
sometimes i do it in vain
so with a little bass and treble
hey mister, it's time for me to explain that i'm the rebel
cold as the devil
straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
they came to see the maniac psychopath
the critics heard of me, and the aftermath
i don't give a damn and it shows
and when i do a stage show i wear street clothes
so they all know me
the lyrical lunatic, the maniac mc
i give a shout out to your homies
and maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, g
on the streets or on tv
it just don't pay to be, a truth tellin' mc
they won't be happy 'til i'm banned
the most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
so point blank in your face
pump up the bass, and join the human race
i throw peace to the bay
cause from the jungle to oaktown, they backin' me up all the way
you know you gotta love the sound
it's from the rebel - the rebel of the underground

rebel, he's a rebel
rebel of the underground
<i>[fourx]</i>

now i'm face to face with the devils
cause they breedin' more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
and police brutality
shit, it put you in the nip and call it technicality
so you reap what you sow
so reap the wrath of the rebel, jackin' 'em up once mo'
now the fox is in the henhouse
creepin' up on your daughter while you sleep i got her sneakin' out
twopac ain't nothin' nice, i'll be nothin' how i wanna
and doin' what i'm gonna
now i'm up to no good
the mastermind of mischief movin' more than most could
so sit and slip into the sound
peep the rebel - the rebel of the underground

rebel, he's a rebel
rebel of the underground
<i>[fourx]</i>

they say they hate me, they wanna hold me down
i guess they scared of the rebel - the rebel of the underground
but i never let it get me
i just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me
in fact, they tryin' to keep me out
try to censor what i say
cause they don't like what i'm talkin' 'bout
so what's wrong with the media today
got brothers sellin' out cause they greedy to get paid
but me, i'm comin' from the soul
and if it don't go gold, my story still gettin' told
and that way they can't stop me
and if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
it's sloppy, don't even try to
i'm a slave to the rhythm, and i'm about to fly through
so, yo, to the people in the ghetto
when ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
now everybody wanna gangbang
they talkin' street slang, but the punks still can't hang
they makin' records 'bout violence
but when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
it kinda make you wanna think about
that ya gotta do some sellin' out, just to get your record out
but twopacalypse is straight down
so feel the wrath of the rebel - the rebel of the underground

twopac is a rebel
rebel of the underground

used to be fat now weighs less than a tic tac
now what's that say about this big epidemic
this hypocritical world and the people in it
now speakin' of, in it cindi loved to get buckwild
fuck with a smile single file she'll bust enough styles
that would be cool, if she was your lover
but fuck that, cindi was my dope fiend mother
welfare checks never stepped through the front door
cause moms would run to the dopeman once more
all those days, had me fiendin' for a hot meal
now i'm a crook; got steel, i do not feel
so don't even trip, when i flip with my thirty-eight
revenge is a bitch and my hit shake the murder rate
word to the mother, i'm touched
when moms come by, niggas hush or get rushed
maybe one day she'll recover
but what will it take, to shake, or break
my part time mutha

i gotta live with a part time

<i>[scratched w/ minor variations â twopac &amp; poppi:]</i>
she's a part time mutha

<i>[angelique:]</i>
i grew up in a home where no-one liked me
moms would hit the pipe, every night, she would fight me
poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest
he's feelin' on my chest, with his hand in my dress
just another pest and yes i was nervous
was this a test? i just don't deserve this
i wanna tell mom, but would she listen
she's bound to be bitchin' if she hasn't got a fix in, so
now i lay me down to sleep, lord don't let him rape me
if he does my soul to keep, don't let the devil take me
can't concentrate i contemplate in my classroom
thinkin' how my step dad raped me in the bathroom
every day i make class and yet i'm missin' periods
the thought of pregnancy is in my head and now i'm fearin' it
i gotta tell mom before she sees me
i told her how he treated me and she didn't believe me
callin' me a slut cause my butt's kinda big so
still that ain't no way to be talkin' to your kids though
i can't believe the way he caught her
got her believin' him and dissin' her own daughter
time for me to break and find another
that's when i discovered
the ways of the days of a part time mutha

i'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block
here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cock
she's gone and i'm thinkin' that my game's so strong
pat myself on the back and move on
is this just how it is hell no
cause she came back with the kid and yo
i been payin' ever since
the clothes the food the cars and, oh, the rent
all of my time gets spent at the workplace
no time to kiss her got me this in the first place
so, i do the dishes and clean the floor

and the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
we can have peace someday, g

to my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
and accept no substitutes

oh no, i won't turn the other cheek
in case ya can't see us while we burn the other week

i'll be swinging like a one man, clan
here we go, turn it up, don't stop
to my homies on the block getting dropped by cops
i'm still around for ya
keeping my sound underground for ya
and i'mma throw a change up
quayle, like you never brought my name up
now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
they feel me when they rolling in they fat jeeps
this ain't just a rap song, a black song
telling all my brothers, get they strap on
and look for me in the struggle
hustling 'til other brothers bubble -

will i quit, will i quit?
they claim that i'm violent, but still i keep
representing, never give up on a good thing
wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
and now i'm like a major threat
cause i remind you of the things you were made to forget
bring the noise, to all my boyz
know the real from the bustas and the decoys
and if ya hustle like a real g
pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
learn to survive in the nine-tre'
i make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
whatever it takes to live and stand
cause nobody else'll give a damn
so we live like caged beasts
waiting for the day to let the rage free

<i>[statements â twopac (dan quayle):]</i>
i was raised in this society so there's no way
you can expect me to be a perfect person cuz i'm a do what i'm a do
i am still thirsty
(there is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published
it has no place in our society.)
they gotta understand me
(withdraw on this record.)
that's how i feel i'm a do whatever i like. i am not a role model


"you could get the finger.. the middle!"

i thought i'd bring a little truth to the young troops
i brought proof that the niggas need guns too
it's not to be a racist, but let's face this:
wouldn't you if we could trade places?
i got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
them same motherfuckers on the beat getting major paid
but when i get my check they taking tax out
so, we paying for these pigs to knock the blacks out
ain't that a bitch, some officers are getting rich
whooping on thugs and robbing drug dealers for they shit
as far as jealousy, being a celebrity
no matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
and the media is greedier than most
you could sell em your soul or they'll be on ya til a niggas ghost
and everyday i read the paper there's another lie
they show my picture for the crimes of another guy
now how's that for the life of a big shot
a dead cop, a law suit, a little kid shot
i play them nuttin ass marks in the park
for trying to earn they stripes in the dark
just cause i come there, don't mean i from there, peep:

let's get along with the mexicans
and we can all have peace on the sets again
imagine that if it took place (ha ha ha)
keeping the smile off they white face
i ain't racist but lets trade places
trace the hate 'n face it

<i>[stretch of live squad:]</i>
struggling, juggling, got it to the black man
eating the scams like i was motherfucking pac man
cops step off, you know the flavor
they fear the ruffneck niggas with the lunatic behavior
and now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
stabbing for a fee, it gets hard on the fucking streets
it's like a madness, fuck making gravy
i rhyme and do crimes, cause either way pays me
a little rough with a hardcore... theme
couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams
mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip
with that roughneck nigga named twopacalypse
representing yg'z yo

seek and po can't forget money bags
sticking up spots and jumping in jags
gotta get ahead and always stay bumbling
and always keep a hand on the gat
cause a niggas straight strugglin'

"stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
still don't nothin' move but the money"

<i>[majestic of live squad:]</i>
i'm used to being poor, but now i'm sick of struggling
i thought about bumping, but mother-fuck juggling
i know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
but i'd rather use my gun cause i get the money quicker, so bust it
look as i cut the records hard to eject
a quick clip threw my body down uhh! it's another hit
i got energy to blast now you want the task here
cuz of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
but rugged and rough is how i'm stepping
mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
eye on the mac cause the dogg got it going on
if you come up stepping you'll be lit like a hick
so you better chill, cause i got too much money to get
a street thug in the motherfucking house, i'm struggling
get drunk but i don't think
i'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
when i yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
cause ya know if you do, you'll be laying in a ditch
you'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
cause i'm playing to win, and survive in the game
i'm strugglin'

"stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
still don't nothin' move but the money"

<i>[twopac:]</i>
big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
ain't nothing changed set it off i let the brains hang
guess who's back, to put niggas on they back
till i call back, niggas running free better fall back
i'm fifty niggas deep beat sleep
with a mossberg wrapped in my seats
three deep in my jeep chief run with the young gunz
struggling and striving, that's how the dough come
now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
throw a bolo so low when i flow yo
much too high to read the signs, i'm blind
clicking on the nine, out to get mine
i go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
blowing motherfuckers to the moon
niggas need to feel me a real g, home from the bumbling
see me on the block, struggling
and rolling with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed
i get in niggas ass, blast
straight strugglin'

"stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
still don't nothin' move but the money"


guess who's back?

two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
better press rec on your deck
here we go, set? pass the moã«t
my trickery's more slippery when wet
wicked as i flip, don't trip, get a grip
it'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
but more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin' to rob me!
and little man wants to be a rap, star
make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
it ain't easy, sleazy even
deceivin those we believe in
no benefits, just tricks and chicks
knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
i shoot a gift, til there ain't none left
and if i find that the track sound def
i catch wreck till i lose my breath
that's how it goes in the land of broke
i dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough

i went from hustlin dicks to makin hits, bustin flicks
now i'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
i pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
i try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
good thoughts i wait, cause they hate my black tape
yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
but if ya got a black face, it's a rat race
i struggle to be rugged and raw, dukes
tryin to survive in the trials and lawsuits
everybody wants to test me, why me?
no lie, niggas cried when they try me
givin up the roughness, justice
i'mma bust as i'm rippin up 'nuff hits
and guess who's back? no longer trapped
cause i snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact

quit now, nigga, eat a dick up
huh, i'm representin'


little something for my godson elijah
and a little girl named corin

some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
i say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
i give a holla to my sisters on welfare
twopac cares if don't nobody else care
and i know they like to beat you down a lot
when you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
but please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep your head up
and when he tells you you ain't nothing, don't believe him
and if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'cause, sister, you don't need him
and i ain't trying to gas ya up, i just call 'em how i see 'em
you know what makes me unhappy? when brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
i think it's time to kill for our women
time to heal our women, be real to our women
and if we don't we'll have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man can't make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up?
i know you're fed up, ladies, but keep your head up

keep ya head up, ooh, child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things'll get brighter
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things'll get brighter

ayo, i remember marvin gaye used to sing to me
he had me feeling like black was the thing to be
and suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
and though we had it rough, we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize momma really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had to give her was my pipe dream
of how i'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
i'm trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
it's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
and in the end it seems i'm heading for the pen
i try to find my friends, but they're blowing in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
it's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems the rain'll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up
you know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
they got money for wars but can't feed the poor
say there ain't no hope for the youth
and the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
we ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a set-up
and even though you're fed up
huh, you got to keep your head up

keep ya head up, ooh, child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things'll get brighter
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things'll get brighter

and uh, to all the ladies having babies on they own
i know it's kinda rough and you're feeling all alone
daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'cause i think we can make it, in fact, i'm sure
and if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
'cause ain't nothing worse than when your son
wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
you can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man, feeling helpless
because there's too many things for you to deal with
dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
while tears is rolling down your cheeks
you steady hoping things don't fall down this week
'cause if it did, you couldn't take it
and don't blame me, i was given this world, i didn't make it
and now my son's getting older and older and colder
from having the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is driving benz
i'm still trying to hold on to surviving friends
and it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
but please, you got to keep your head up


<i>[twopac speaking: ]</i>
yo, law!
is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one?
yeah! mr. fuck-a-cop is back
and i still don't give a fuck, yaknahmsayin'?
puffin' on this indo
in the studio with my partners out here
pacific heights in the house, know what i mean

i was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga
you gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga
cause the police love to break a nigga
send 'em upstate cause they straight-up hate the niggas
so what i do is get a crew of zoo niggas
straight fools into rules and do niggas
and one-time had enough of me
i'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me
they wanna send me to the pen, punk, picture that
i stay strapped, motherfuckers better get your gat
it ain't easy bein' me, i can't take it
life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
and ever since the movies these hoes try to do me
if they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
now can you picture me coolin' at a night club?
nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
since i wear a lot of gold, they plot
don't know what i got and get shot with the hot ones
and, aw yeah, i wanna feel guilty
but you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
you'll get smacked behind the hill with my phone on my pager
it's beepin' while i cut you with my razor
i'm not violent, i'm petrified and nervous
i got no mercy for these niggas tryin' to serve us
but if you catch me outta pocket, then i'm got
you love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop
now drop it

strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggas <i>[threex]</i>

strictly for my niggas, makin' g's

reflected and disrespected, plus i'm rejected
you're just another rapper, who swears he's makin' records
that's what they said - whenever i would walk by
i never tripped though - always kept my head up high
eventually i knew, that i would find my way
after the darkest night always comes a brighter day
and some would say, that turned away is all you'll get
i just said "bet!," and never let 'em see me sweat
cause in the end, i knew that i would have it all
while non-believers were prayin' for my downfall
and some would call and tell me that they wish me well
but in my heart, i'm knowin' that they wish me hell
yo, get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent
i hit the studio, cause that's where all my money went
never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
don't ever stop, just push it til you hit the top
and if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
be true to you, and that way you can never fall
but beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke
just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
and when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
and there you are, can't even pay your car, nope
and when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed
remember how it felt and then remember this
be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
cause they can all suck dick - it's strictly for my niggas

strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggas <i>[threex]</i>

this is for the critics if you live up
pick up my shit or i'll be back doin' stick-ups
i better see five stars next to my picture
if not, twopac will cop the glock and come knockin' to get 'cha
i told you once, motherfucker, i'm a nut
play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked
niggas know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down
i'm comin' outta oaktown, bitch fuck around
and it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore
nigga it's the way you throw them thangs in the war
and to the marks that be talkin' all that shit
screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch
and the niggas that i ran into recently
the motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
you little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin' trigga
now you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga
mr. troublesome; niggas tried to play me with the gat
but like terminator, nigga, i'll be back
yeah! and i'll be back with a fuckin' army
you tried to harm me - ring the alarm, g
cause most motherfuckers love to act up
without they backup
when they get jacked up they crack up
it's strictly for my niggas at the show
so they know, not to play me like a ho
strictly for my...

strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggas <i>[threex]</i>


growing up as an inner city brotha
where every other had a pops and a motha
i was the product of a heated lover.
nobody knew how deep it screwed me
and since my pops never knew me
my family didn't know what to do with me.
was i somebody they despised?
curious look in they eyes
as if they wonder if i'm dead or alive
and poor momma can't control me
"quit tryin' to save my soul, i wanna roll with my homies!"
a ticken timebomb, can't nobody fade me
packin' a three hundred and eighty and fiendin' for mercedes
suckers scatter but it don't matter i'm a cool shot
punks drop from all the buckshots the fools got
i'm tired of being a nice guy
i've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
so they label me a lunatic 
could care less death or success
is what i quest 'cause i'm fearless
now the streets are deathrow

('cause i'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
the streets are deathrow.
<i>[twox]</i>

i just murdered a man, i'm even more stressed wearin' a vest
hopin' that they're aimin' at my chest
much too young to bite the bullet
hand on the trigga
i see my life before my eyes each time i pull it
i hope i live to be a man
must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in the state pen
counting pennys over the years i'd done stacked many
proving wrong those
who swore i'd wouldn't live till twenty
now they gotta cope
since it's the only thing i know
it's difficult to let it go
i'm startin' to lose my hair 'cause i worry
hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
but now i gotta move away now
'cause these suckers love ta' spray where i lay down
my homie lost his family, he snapped;
shot up half the block to bring them back
the streets are deathrow

('cause i'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
the streets are deathrow.
<i>[twox]</i>

i'm dangerous when drunk i only drink beer
gin makes me sin
unable to think clear
henessey makes me think my enemy is getting close
boom boom boom 
got me shooting at a ghost
some call me crazy but this is what you gave me
amongst the babies who raised up from the slavery
i sport a vest and hit the sess to kill the stress
moved out west and i invest in all the best
those who test will find a bullet in they chest
put to rest by a brotha who was hopeless
grow up broke on the rope of insanity
how many pistols smoking coming from a broken family
i'm sick of being tired
sick of the sirens, body bags, and the gun firing
tell bush, "push the button!" 'cause i'm fed
tired of hearin' these voices in my head
the streets are deathrow

('cause i'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
the streets are deathrow.

('cause i'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')

what you mean you don't know? i get around
the underground just don't stop for hoes, i get around
still down with the underground, i get around
yeah, ayo, shock, let them hoes know!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
finger tips on the hips as i dip
gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships
it's a trip, i love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'
put a little twist in her hips 'cause i'm watchin'
conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
now we're all alone: why the lights on?
turn them off! time to set it off, get you wet and soft
somethin' is on your mind, let it off
you don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
well, if i couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?
it's a lot of real g's doin' time
'cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
you picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
you need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'cause i only got one night in town
break out or be clowned, baby doll, are you down? i get around


<i>[twopac:]</i>
daddy's home...

heh, so?
you say that like that means something to me
you've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
for you to be comin home talkin that "daddy's home" shit (nigga)
we been gettin along fine just without you
me, my brother, and my mother
so if you don't mind, you can step the fuck off, pops... fuck you!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
a pitiful plight, so i pray for a starry night
please send me a pops before puberty
the things i wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
moms always work, i barely see her
i'm startin to get worried without a pops i'll grow to be her
it's a wonder they don't understand kids today
so when i pray, i pray i'll never grow to be that way
and i hope that he answers me
i heard god don't like ugly well take a look at my family
a different father every weekend
before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
i'm gettin sick of all the friendships
as soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
how can i be a man if there's no role model?
strivin to save my soul i stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
i'm so sorry...

i'm so sorry
for all this time (i'm so sorry)
for all this time
for all this time (don't lie)
i'm so sorry
for all this time (so, sorry)
for all this time
for all this time, so sorry baby!

<i>[wycked:]</i>
moms had to entertain many men;
didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again.
i'm gettin a bit older and i'm startin to be a bother;
moms can't stand me cause i'm lookin like my father
should i stay or run away? tell me the answer
moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough;
couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
that's why i'll never be a father;
unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother
(that's when i started hatin' the phony smiles
said i was an only child)
look at mama's lonely smile!
it's hard for a son to see his mother cry
she only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
i'm so sorry...

i'm so sorry
for all this time (i'm so sorry)
for all this time
for all this time (don't lie)
i'm so sorry
for all this time (so, sorry)
for all this time
for all this time, so sorry baby!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
and ohh -i guess ya didn't know 
that i would grow to be so strong
lookin kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?
where was the money that you said, you would send me
talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
ask about school and my welfare
but it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
you think i'm blind but this time i see you comin, jack!
you grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back
ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
so don't even start with that "born to be a father" shit
don't even bother with your dollars i don't need it
i'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, g
now that i finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
you're so sorry

i'm so sorry
for all this time (i'm so sorry)
for all this time
for all this time (don't lie)
i'm so sorry
for all this time (so, sorry)
for all this time
for all this time, so sorry baby!

<i>[twopac impersonating his father:]</i>
i never meant to leave but i was wanted
crossed too many people every house i'd touch was haunted
had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger;
if i wanted to to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number
made me watch my back i had no happy home to run to
maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast
but livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
i wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
it took a little longer than i thought
i slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
now i'm doin time and i wish you'd understand
all i ever wanted was for you to be a man
and grow to be the titan you was meant to be
keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
i'm so sorry...

i'm so sorry
for all this time (i'm so sorry)
for all this time
for all this time (don't lie)
i'm so sorry
for all this time (so, sorry)
for all this time
for all this time, so sorry baby!

a coward dies a thousand deaths
a soldier dies but once

they say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
puffing weed as i position myself to clock g's
my enemies scatter in suicidal situations
never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin'
pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches
bitches is bad-mouth, âcause brawling motherfuckers is bold
but charge them hoes; the game should be sold
i'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me
addicted to drama, so even mama couldn't raise me
even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
i run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps
i'm duckin' the cops, i hit the weed as i'm clutchin' my glock
niggas is hot when i hit the block; what if i die tonight?

<i>[twopac + dr. dre:]</i>
if i die tonight
if i die tonight
fuck it, if i die tonight
tonight's the night i get in some shit

polish your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump
when i get to poppin', niggas is droppin' then they done
calling the coroner, come collect the fucking corpse
he got hit by a killer, preoccupied with being boss
revenge is the method
whenever steppin', keep a weapon close
adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
hit the block and fill your pockets, making crack sales
picture perfection, pursuing paper with a passion
visions of prisons for all the pussies that i blasted
running with criminals individuals with no remorse
try to stop me, my pistol posse's using deadly force
in my brain all i can think about is fame
the police know my name
a different game, ain't a thing changed
i'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
conversating like they still here; if i die tonight

<i>[twopac + dr. dre:]</i>
if i die tonight
scare to die nigga, is ya, ha?
if i die tonight
never fear, never worry
if i die tonight
tonight's the night i get in some shit

pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
pray to the heaven's, .three hundred and fifty-seven's to the sky
and i hope i'm forgiven for thug livin' when i die
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
a stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when i lay her
pistol whippin' these simps, for being petrified and lame
disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
going insane, never die, i live eternal, who shall i fear?
don't shed a tear for me, nigga, i ain't happy here
i hope they bury me and send me to my rest
headlines reading 'murdered to death', my last breath
take a look, picture a crook on his last stand
motherfuckers don't understand; if i die tonight

<i>[twopac + dr. dre:]</i>
nigga! if i die tonight
no fear nigga, never worry
if i die tonight
bury me a motherfucking g, closed casket fuck it
if i die tonight
you know
tonight's the night i get in some shit

kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
"tonight's the night i get in some shit"
kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder

it's just me against the world
nothin' to lose
it's just me against the world, baby
i got nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world
stuck in the game
me against the world, baby

<i>[twopac:]</i>
can you picture my prophecy?
stress in the city, the cops is on top of me
the projects is full of bullets, though bodies is droppin'
they ain't no stoppin' me
constantly movin' while makin' millions
witnessin' killings
leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
can't reach the children 'cause they're illin'
addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
hard headed bastard
maybe he'll listen in his casket; the aftermath
more bodies being buried, i'm losin' my homies in a hurry
they're relocatin' to the cemetery
got me runnin', stressin', my vision's blurry
the question is will i live? no one in the world loves me
i'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
put one in the chamber whenever i'm feeling this anger
don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
what's the use? unless we're shootin' no one notices the youth
it's just me against the world, baby

<i>[twopac &amp; puff johnson:]</i>
me against the world
it's just me against the world
it's just me against the world
me against the world
cause it's just me against the world, baby
me against the world
i got nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
i got nothin' to lose

<i>[yaki kadafi:]</i>
could somebody help me? i'm out here all by myself
see ladies in stores, baby capone's, livin' wealthy
pictures of my birth on this earth is what i'm dreamin'
seein' daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
already crazy and screamin'
i guess them nightmares as a child
had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
is there another route? for a crooked outlaw
veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

<i>[e.d.i. mean:]</i>
everyday there's more death, and plus i'm dough-less
i'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
i'm about to act up, go load the mac up, now watch me klacka
tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
and evil's lurkin', i can see him smirkin' when i gets to pervin'
so what? go put some work in, and make my mail
makin' sales, riskin' twenty-five with a l, but oh well

<i>[twopac &amp; puff johnson:]</i>
me against the world
with nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world
it's just me against the world, baby
me against the world
i got nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world
it's just me against the world, baby
with nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
me against the world
me against the world
i got nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world, baby (eleven million, forty-seven thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
with all this extra stressin'
the question i wonder is after death, after my last breath
when will i finally get to rest through this oppression?
they punish the people that's askin' questions,and those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
the message i stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
be grateful for blessings, don't ever change, keep your essence
the power is in the people and politics we address
always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
and when you get stranded
and things don't go the way you planned it
dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
if i'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
it wasn't nothin' like the game, it's just me against the world

<i>[twopac &amp; puff johnson:]</i>
me against the world
nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
me against the world
got me stuck in the game, it's just me against the world
nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
me against the world (eleven million, forty-seven thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
hahaha, that's right
i know it seem hard sometimes
but uh, remember one thing
through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
so no matter how hard it get
stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it!


i shall not fear no man but god
though i walk through the valley of death
i shed so many tears
if i should die before i wake
please god walk with me
grab a nigga and take me to heaven

back in elementary, i thrived on misery
left me alone i grew up amongst a dying breed
inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
until i got that thug life tatted on my chest
tell me can you feel me
i'm not living in the past, you wanna last?
be the first to blast remember kato
no longer with us; he's deceased
call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace
is there heaven for a g? remember me
so many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

i! i suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
lord! i lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

now that i'm struggling in this business, by any means
label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
and fuck the world cause i'm cursed, i'm having visions
of leaving here in a hearse, god can you feel me?
take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
show me some happiness again, i'm going blind
i spend my time in this cell, ain't living well
i know my destiny is hell. where did i fail?
my life is in denial and when i die
baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

lord! i suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
lord! i lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

now i'm lost and i'm weary, so many tears
i'm suicidal so don't stand near me
my every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
to embrace an early death, now there's nothing left
there was no mercy on the streets, i couldn't rest
i'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace
and though my soul was deleted, i couldn't see it
i had my mind full of demons trying to break free
they planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame
inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
no memories, just a misery
painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep
will i survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun
please lord forgive me for my sins, cause here i come

lord! (god!), i suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
god! i lost so many peers

and lord knows i tried, been a witness to homicide
seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die
wonder why as i walk by
broken-hearted as i glance at the chalk line, getting high
this ain't the life for me, i wanna change
but ain't no future bright for me, i'm stuck in the game
i'm trapped inside a maze
see this tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy
disillusioned lately, i've been really wanting babies
so i could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison
i'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
i'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the lord to let me in
to heaven's door -- shed so many tears

lord! lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...
i lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...
lord! i suffered many years, and shed so many tears...
god! i lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

<i>[twopac:]</i>
a lotta people think it's easy
to settle down, got a woman that'll please me

i wanna take you to the movies, and the park
let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
now that it's passion, hold me tight
don't need lights, i can see you by the moonlight
i know your man ain't lovin' you right
you're lonely and depressed you need a thug in your life
enough talkin', you want me to leave, i'll get to walkin'
see you later, 'cause baby i'm a player, and all i heard was

i wanna dedicate this one to robert 'yummy' sandifer
and all other lil' young niggas that's in a rush to be gangstas

as a young nigga, i'm almost runnin' in the wind
give anything, to be that innocent again, when i was ten
i didn't bang but i was hangin' with the homies
'til them niggas started slangin', now they don't know me
i got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
lately i've been tryin' to make a mill-ion, can you blame me?
with that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
if them cowards really want me, come get me, and even i
someday will die but i'm cautious, i'm fin' to ride
put down the top, now we flossin'
hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
workin' with a twenty sack of indo, feelin' good
stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
and i can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, though it's bad
but all we had was our hopes and dreams
couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
as young niggas

he's the kind of g like everybody knows
(as a strung nigga)
he's always g'd up, from head to toe
(my memories as a young nigga)
always got it blown like al capone
(strung nigga)
he's the downest g i've ever known

back in junior high, when we was barely gettin' by, when daddy died
that's when my momma started gettin' high
my neighborhood was full of drive-bys, couldn't survive
all our homies livin' short lives, i couldn't cry
told my momma if i did die, just put a blunt in my casket
let me get my dead homies high
come follow me throughout my history, it's just
me against the world stuck in misery; as a young nigga
my only thing was to be paid
life full of riches avoid snitches cause they shady, back in the days
we always found the time to play
but that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
not just l.a., but in the bay and in chicago and even st. louis
every stadium that i go, when will they change?
stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
remember how it was, to be a young nigga

he's the kind of g like everybody knows
(as a young nigga)
he's always g'd up, from head to toe
(my memories as a young nigga)
always got it blown like al capone
(young nigga)
he's the downest g i've ever known

<i>[ad-lib:]</i>
i'm tellin' you
...to be young, have your brains and have every limb and all that
yo, y'all niggas don't know how good you really do got it
muh'fuckers need to just calm down
and peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life
'fore you end your life before you begin your life
you dumb nigga

now that i'm grown, i got my mind on bein' somethin'
don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin' nuttin
tryin' to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real
and i will even if it kills me, my young niggas
break away from these dumb niggas
put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come figure
fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin'
puttin' niggas in a casket, murdered for hangin'
at the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin'
cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day
i watch the murder rate increases, and even worse
the epidemic and diseases, what is the future?
the projects lookin' hopeless, where
more and more brothers givin' up and don't care
sometimes i hate when brothers act up, i hit the weed
and i proceed to blow the track up, for young niggas

he's the kind of g like everybody knows
(for the young niggas)
he's always g'd up, from head to toe
(my memories as a young nigga)
always got it blown like al capone
(this for nigga.., this for the young nigga)
he's the downest g i've ever known

he's the kind of g like everybody knows
he's always g'd up, from head to toe
he always got it blown like al capone
he's the downest g i've ever known

<i>[collision over the last four lines:]</i>
this go out to the young thugs, the have-nots (you know)
little bad motherfuckers from the block (that's right)
them niggas that's thirteen and fourteen
drivin' cadillacs, benzes and shit (i see you boy)
young motherfuckin' hustlers (make that money boy)
stay strong nigga
you could be a fuckin' accountant, not a dope dealer
you know what i'm sayin'? (go to school nigga, go to school)
fuck around and, you pimpin' out here
you could be a lawyer (really doe)
niggas gotta get they priorities straight
(don't see johnny cochran out in this motherfucker)
really doe. young niggas. little rahrah
(sup nigga) especially my little cousins don't be no dumb guy
(don't be a dumb nigga, listen, young niggas)


<i>[lady levi:]</i>
oh, you thug life is yours?
life ain't no something you can rap with
ooh come no ordinary game
the game no something you can rap with
me's a player you know?
i do not, play in no game
me just, make money, dollars.
every time, seen?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now how can i explain how this game laced me, plus with this fame
i got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
got to the point where i was driven, twenty-four/seven
money's my mission, just a nigga tryin' to make a livin'
these busta tricks don't want no mail
they spendin' they riches on skanless bitches, who'll stay petrified in jail
it's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
jealous-ass bitches, player-hatin' but we still kick it
always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin' no sleep
but still, i get my money on major, continuously
communicatin' through my pager, niggas know me
don't have no homies since they jealous, i hustle solo
'cause when i'm broke i got no time for the fellas listen
ain't nothin' poppin' 'bout no broke nigga, i ain't no joke
fuck what they say and get your dough nigga

<i>[richie rich:]</i>
(well let me shoot some of this how heavy type of shit)
certain niggas wanna stick to the game, you's a trick to the game
waitin' upon your turn, son when will you learn?
ain't no turns given, niggas be twistin' and takin' shit
puttin' they sack down, then puttin' they mack down
me myself i hustle with finesse yes i'm an oakland baller
rule number one â check game, and fo' sho' you gon' respect game
be your own nigga meanin' buy your own dope
cause that front shit is punk shit, something i never funked with
be true to this game and this game will be true to you
that's real shit; disrespect, see what this here do to you
that jackin' and robbin', despisin' your homie
ain't healthy, niggas be endin' up dead 'fore they get wealthy
but not me though, i'm sewin' somethin' major
so what i reap is boss â that's why my public status is floss

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
my only way to stack mail, is out here doin' dirt
my decisions do or die, been hustlin' since junior high
no time for askin' why, gettin' high, gettin' mine
put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five shells
cause life is hell, and everybody dies
what about these niggas i despise
them loud talkin', cowards shootin' guns into crowds, jeopardizin' lives
shoot 'em right between them niggas' eyes, it's time to realize
follow the rules or follow them fools that die
everybody's tryin' to make the news
niggas confused, quit tryin' to be an o.g. and pay your dues
if you choose to apply yourself
go with the grain then, come into riches and the bitches and the fame
heavy in the game

<i>[ad-libs â lady levi (eboni foster):]</i>

<i>[*coughing harder*]</i>
lord knows	
<i>[*one final cough*]</i>

i smoke a blunt to take the pain out
and if i wasn't high, i'd probably try to blow my brains out
i'm hopeless, they should've killed me as a baby
and now they got me trapped in the storm, i'm goin' crazy
forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
and if i don't blast i'll be the victim of them bastards
i'm losin' hope, they got me stressin', can the lord forgive me
got the spirit of a thug in me
another sip of that drink, this hennessey got me queasy
don't wanna hurl, young nigga take it easy
picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
don't underestimate the power of a fiend
to my homies on the block
slangin' rocks with your glocks put this tape in your box
when you're runnin from the cops -- and never look back
if they could be black, then they would switch
open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and lord knows...

i wonder if the lord will forgive me or bury me a g
i couldn't let my adversaries worry me
and every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
and still a nigga stressin' over death
if i could choose when a nigga die, figure i'd
take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
when everyday it's another death, with every breath
it's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
you could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
murderin' niggas, look what it's come to
my memories bring me misery, and life is hard 
in the ghetto, it's insanity, i can't breathe
got me thinking, what do hell got?
cause i done suffered so much, i'm feelin' shell-shocked
and drive-by's an everyday thang
i done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin' game

done lost too many niggas to this gangbangin'
homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin', fucked up!
i had to tell him it was alright, and that's a lie
and he knew it when he shook and died, my god
even though i know i'm wrong man
hennessey make a nigga think he strong, man (heh heh)
i can't sleep, so i stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
try to calm me down, i ain't givin' up
i'm gettin' lost in the weed, man, gettin' high

<i>[twopac:]</i>
you are appreciated
when i was young, me and my mama had beef
seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought i'd see her face
ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
suspended from school
and scared to go home, i was a fool
with the big boys breaking all the rules
i shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddies, the same drama
when things went wrong we'd blame mama
i reminisce on the stress i caused, it was hell
huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
and who'd think in elementary, hey
i'd see the penitentiary one day?
and running from the police, that's right
mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
and even as a crack fiend, mama
you always was a black queen, mama
i finally understand
for a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
you always was committed
a poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
there's no way i can pay you back, but the plan
is to show you that i understand; you are appreciated

<i>[reggie green and "sweet franklin" (twopac):]</i>
lady, don't you know we love ya? (dear mama)
sweet lady, place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
no love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
he passed away and i didn't cry, 'cause my anger
wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
they say i'm wrong and i'm heartless, but all along
i was looking for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs
and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin'
i needed money of my own, so i started slangin'
i ain't guilty, 'cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good putting money in your mailbox
i love paying rent when the rent is due
i hope you got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
'cause when i was low you was there for me
and never left me alone, because you cared for me
and i could see you coming home after work late
you're in the kitchen, trying to fix us a hot plate
you just working with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgivin'
but now the road got rough, you're alone
you're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
and there's no way i can pay you back, but my plan
is to show you that i understand; you are appreciated

<i>[reggie green and "sweet franklin" (twopac):]</i>
lady, don't you know we love ya? (dear mama)
sweet lady, place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
pour out some liquor and i reminisce
'cause through the drama i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that i'm hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act crazy
i gotta thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret, always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
everything will be alright if you hold on
it's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
and there's no way i can pay you back, but my plan
is to show you that i understand; you are appreciated

<i>[reggie green and sweet franklin (twopac):]</i>
lady, don't you know we love ya? (dear mama)
sweet lady, place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (dear mama)
sweet lady
lady (dear mama)
lady
lady


<i>[ad-lib:]</i>
keepin' it real

i take a shot of hennessy, now i'm strong enough to face the madness
nickel bag full of cess weed laced with hash
phone calls from my niggas on the, other side
two childhood friends just died, i couldn't cry
a damn shame, when will we ever change?
and what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain?
arguments with my boo, it's true
i spend mo' time with my niggas than i do with you
but everywhere it's the same thang, that's the game
i'll be damned if a thang changed, fuck the fame
i'll be hustlin' to make a mill-ion
lord knows ain't no love for us ghetto children
so we cold, rag-top slowin' down, time to stop for gas
beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass, uh
it ain't easy, that's my motto
drinkin' tanqueray straight out the bottle
everybody wanna know if i'm insane
my baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
and all the drama got me stressin' like i'm hopeless
i can't cope me and the homies smokin' roaches
cause we broke late night hangin' out 'til the sunrise gettin' high
watchin' the cops roll by
it ain't easy... that's right... it ain't easy

...easy, being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free?
it ain't easy, being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free?
it ain't easy, being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free?

i can't sleep, niggas plottin' on me, kill me while i'm dreamin'
wake up sweaty and screamin', cause i can hear them suckers schemin'
probably paranoid, problem is, them punks be fantasizin'
a brother bite the bullet, open fire and i died
i wonder why this just the way it is
even now lookin' out for these killa kids
cause they wild
bill clinton can you recognize a nigga representin'
doin' twenty to life in san quentin
gettin' calls from my nigga mike tyson, ain't nuttin' nice
yo 'pac, do something righteous witcha life
and even though you're innocent you still a nigga, so they figure, rather have you behind bars than triggers
but i'm hold ya down and holla thug life
lickin' shots 'til i see my niggas free on the block
but no it ain't easy, hahahah
'til i see my niggas free on the block, uh
it ain't easy

it ain't easy, being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free?
it ain't easy, being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free?
it ain't easy, being me
will i see the penitentiary?..

lately been reminiscin'
'bout peppermint schnapps in junior high hit the block
keep an eye on the cops while d-boys slang rocks
just a project kid without a conscience, i'm havin' dreams
of hearin' screams at my concerts
me and all my childhood peers through the years tryin' to stack a little green
i was only seventeen, when i started servin' fiends
and i wish there was another way to stack a dolla
sold my impala cause these hard times make me wanna holla
will i live to see tomorrow, am i fallin' off?
i hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of y'all
ain't nobody down with me i'm thuggin'
i can't go home 'cause muh-fuckers think i'm buggin'
so now i'm in this high powered cell at the county jail
punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail
what, do i do in these county blues
gettin' battered and bruised by the you know who
and these fakes get to shakin' when they face me
snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
sittin' in this, livin' hell, listenin' to niggas yell
tryna torture 'em to tell, i'm gettin' mail
but ain't nobody sayin' much, the same old nuts
is makin' bucks while these sluts is gettin' fucked
they violated my probation
and it seems i'll be goin' on a long vacation
meanwhile it ain't easy..
no it ain't easy

it ain't easy, being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free?
it ain't easy, being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free?
it ain't easy, being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free?
it ain't easy, being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free?
it ain't easy, being me
will i see the penitentiary or will i stay free?

<i>[twopac and anya talking:]</i>
whassup? it's twopac. can you get away?

(of course he gon' mind)
let me take you to lunch, i'll have you back before he even get home, before anybody see

aww c'mon! please...
(nah)
oh aight â what's wrong with your eye?
why you got on glasses?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
ever since i met ya i could peep the pressure
it's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
i can see your state of misery from the introduction
ain't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion
maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
late night phone conversations â would that be ok?
i don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
i can see you're cautious and i'm careful not to scare you
the anticipation of love makin'
got you shakin' when i'm standin' near you
news of precision will prepare ya
in case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
now the picture's gettin' clearer
all he does is hit you hard
i tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in god
i don't understand, i just wanna bring ya home
i wonder should i leave you alone
and find a woman of my own
all the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
i contemplate â but in my heart i know you worth it
tell me, can you get away?

ebony, can you get away?
c'monâ¦ let's goâ¦ can you get away?
can you get away?

<i>[anya pinto (twopac):]</i>
so much pressure in the air (i know, i know)
and i can't get away (just for a little while love)
i'm not happy here (i know it's hard but, can you get away?)
so much pressure in the air
(let's go man, get up outta there, can you get away?)
and i can't get away (do you love him?)
i'm not happy here (do you love that man?)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
could it be my destiny to be lonely?
ain't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me
'cause they phony
but you was different, i got no need to be suspicious
'cause i can tell, my life with you would be delicious
the way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
i'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it
even though i got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it
slowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it
you blow me kisses when he ain't lookin'
now your heart's tooken
my only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
wanna take you there but you scared to follow
come see tomorrow
hopin' i can take you through the pain and sorrow
let you know i care â that someone's there for your struggle
depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
i wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
i told you before, no time to waste
we can hook up at the store. can you get away?

<i>[anya pinto (twopac):]</i>
so much pressure in the air (i know it is)
and i can't get away (yeah, you can)
i'm not happy here (you ain't happy, huh? can you get away?)
so much pressure in the air (i knowâ¦ is he beatin' on you?)
and i can't get away (did he punch you?)
i'm not happy here (throwin' you around the house?)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i sit here reminiscin' and i hope you listenin'
in the position to pressure and offer competition
me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
'cause now it's on for you and me, all i can see
a happy home â that's my fantasy
but my reality is problems with your man and me
what can i do? don't wanna lose you to this sucker
'cause if he touch ya, i got some drama for that busta
don't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast
nobody knows, on who controls will it last?
before i ask, i hope you see that i'm sincere
and even if you stay with him today i'm still here
i refuse to give up, 'cause i believe in what we share
you're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
'cause everything i feel for you i wanna let you know
passionately yours and i'll never let you go
tell me, can you get away?

<i>[anya pinto (twopac):]</i>
so much pressure in the air (can't get away why?)
and i can't get away
i'm not happy here
(let me take you away, all i wanna know, can you get away?)
so much pressure in the air (man)
and i can't get away (course you can get away)
i'm not happy here
(if you really wanted to get away, you could get away)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
you ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress

eric b. &amp; rakim was, the shit to me
i flip to see a doug e. fresh show, with ricky d
and red alert was puttin in work, with chuck chill

when de la soul was puttin potholes in the game
i can't explain how it was, whodini
had me puffin on that buddha gettin buzzed, cause there i was
them block parties in the projects, and on my block
you diggy don't stop, sippin on that private stock
through my speaker queen latifah, and mc lyte

i had, shell toes, and bvd's
a killer crease inside my lee's when i hit the streets
i'm playing skelly, ringolevio, or catch a kiss
before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch
i remember. way back, the weak weed they had
too many seeds in the trey bag
i'm on the train headin uptown, freestyling
with some wild kids from bucktown, profiling
cus the hoochies was starin, thinking, "what them niggas wearing?"
i'm wondering if that's her hair, i remember
stickball, humpin hoochies on the wall
or taking leaks on the steps, stinking up the hall
through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
a young nigga tryin to stay away from rikers isle
me and my homies breakin nights, tryin to keep it true
out on the roof sipping ninety proof, ain't nuttin like the old school

you don't work, you don't fuck, you don't
you don't do a goddamn thing

i see death around the corner, gotta stay high while i survive
in the city where the skinny niggas die
if they bury me, bury me as a g nigga, no need to worry
i expect retaliation in a hurry
i see death around the- corner, anyday
tryin to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
in a ball of confusion, i'm thinkin' 'bout my daddy
madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
i guess i seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
am i paranoid? - tell me the truth
i'm out the window with my ak, ready to shoot
ran out of indo and my mind can't take the stress, i'm out of breath
make me wanna kill my damn self; but i see death around the corner

i see death around the corner
("but having respect, that feels even better.")
i see death around the corner
("when we were kids, belonging felt good.")

i see death around the corner, the pressure's gettin' to me
i no longer trust my homies - them phonies tried to do me
smokin' too much weed, got me paranoid, stressed
pack a gat and my vest, under my clothes when i dress
here's hopin' i die the way i lived, straight thuggin'
huggin' my trigger for all them niggas that was buggin'
my homie told me once, don't you trust them other suckers
they front like they your homies but they phony motherfuckers
and even if i did die young, who'd care
all i ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
got homies in my head that done passed away screamin', please
young nigga, make g's
i can't give up, although i'm hopeless, i think my mind's gone
all i can do is get my grind on, death around the corner

("when we were kids, belonging felt good.")
i see death around the corner
("but having respect, that feels even better.")
i see death around the corner
("when we were kids, belonging felt good.")

drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
and smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household
and drinkin' liquor til' you out cold

(i'm eleven)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
cause all i see is, murder murder, my mind state
preoccupied with homicide, tryin' to survive through this crime rate
dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
gunfire now they require many closed caskets
who can you blame? it's insane what we been through
witnessin' evil that these men do, bitches sin too
in fact they be the reasons niggas get to bleedin'
pull 'n' fuckin' fire when i leave 'em, you shoulda seen 'em
hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) negroes disposed of
and snitches get dealt with, with no love
body bags of adversaries that i had to bury
i broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
but never worry, they'll remember me through history
causin' motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a

outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (they came in to sin)
outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (dear god, i wonder could you save me?)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
before i close my eyes i fantasize i'm livin' well
when i awake and realize i'm just a prisoner in hell
just as well, cause in my cell i'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
exercisin', visualizin', everyone inside a casket
picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks
sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
will i last? heaven or hell? freedom or jail?
shit's hard, who can you tell? and if we fail?
high speeds, and thai weed on the freeway
when will they learn to take it easy? uh
drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive
by makin' motherfuckers fry
got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
helicopters tryna hover over niggas 'til we drop
got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire
hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a liar
now it's time to expire, i see the judge, spray the bitch
"motherfuckers is crooked," is what i scream, and hit the fence
i commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
never missin', an early grave is my only mission
if i die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
may god forgive me, i was high, label me a

outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (they came in to sin)
outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (dear god, i wonder could you save me?)

<i>[dramacydal:]</i>
<i>[kadafi:]</i>
society lied to me, i ain't never gonna try to be
my mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
i witnessed niggas lose they chest

<i>[kastro:]</i>
so i just... swallow my beck's and holla, "fuck 'em!"
and if i'm next... just let a nigga step with somethin'
i ain't fearin' nuttin'
<i>[edi amin (kastro):]</i>

what really go on in the mind of a nigga
that get down for theirs
constantly, money over bitches
not bitches over money
stay on your grind, nigga
my ambitions as a ridah
my ambitions as a ridah

so many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
this life as a rap star is nothing without guard
was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public
my attitude was "fuck it," because motherfuckers love it
to be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
to catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
then i spit some game in her ear, "go to the telly, hoe!"
equipped with money in a benz 'cause, bitch, i'm barely broke
i'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feeling crucial
from player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
from hustlin' and prayers
to breaking motherfuckers to pay up
i got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
i'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so i'm wishin'
competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'
i'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
no guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
now it's on and it's on because i said so
can't trust a bitch in the business so i got with death row
now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
but thug niggas be on point and game tight
me, syke and bogart strapped up the same night
got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
these niggas is jealous
'cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya
hopin' you listen, i catch you payin' attention
to my ambitions as a ridah

i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah
you don't wanna fuck with me
got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g
let's get ready to rumble

peep it, it was my only wish to rise
above these jealous coward motherfuckers i despise
when it's time to ride
i was the first off this side, give me the nine
i'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
that's what they screaming as they drill me
but i'm hard to kill (that's all you niggas got?)
so open fire, i see you kill me, witness my steel
spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
i'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
mama, come rescue me, i'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
i'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when i'm caught
(shoot!) fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrificin'
won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga tyson
thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
when it's time to die, to be a man
and pick the way you leave
fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah
you don't wanna fuck with me
got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g
let's get ready to rumble

my murderous lyrics
equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
pay off the block, evade the cops
'cause i know they coming for me
i been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
now i'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
question my methods to switch up speeds
sure as some bitches bleed
niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
blast me, but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
didn't diminish my powers
so now i'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards
that's why they tried to set me up
had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed they wet me up
but i'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
at the time i contemplate the way that god made it
lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
for money i'll have these motherfuckers buried
i been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
knowin' when i get out, they gon' feel it
witness the realest! a hoo-ridah when i put the shit inside
the cry from all your people when they find her
just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
revenge on them niggas that played me
and all the cowards that was down with it
now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah
you don't wanna fuck with me
got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g
let's get ready to rumble

wise decisions, based on lies we livin'

bumpin' these walls as i pause, addicted to the fast life
i try to holla, but you tell me you taken
sayin' you ain't impressed with the money i'm makin'

fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity

she's so scandalous. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
(aiyyo. how the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be
you ever peep that shit? (nah)
a bitch can be like fifteen, fuckin with a nigga thirty-five
gettin him for ends
hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent
when these niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over then
that's aight though
keep a nigga heavy in the game, bout so long
watch them hoes
all you niggaz out there
beware these lyin ass scandalous bitches)


<i>[daz dillinger:]</i>
you find an mc like me who's strong
leavin' motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
and when i command the microphone i get deadly as khan though
with a bear and a snake and a panda, i'm all those
who can withstand the more power i gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star
finally realizin' who the fuck we are
when i penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded
would it be the greatest mc of all time when i created rhyme
for the simple fact, when i attack, i crush your pride
my intention to ride, every time on lye
i'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard, i'm faced what i'ma ride
breakin' in gas with the 'sixty-eight all day
in-and-out with my pay, i'm soon to count the bodies

<i>[twopac:]</i>
so mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation
so you can be more familiar with the nigga you facin'
we must be patient, nothin' better than communication
known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
sorry i left that ass waitin'
no more procrastination, give up to fate and get that ass shakin'
i'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
don't take your life for granted
put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet
it's similar to rhythm nation, but thugged out, forgive me, janet
who's in control, i'm activatin' your souls
you know the way the games get controlled
yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
told me alize and cristal blows your mind
bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme i wrote
takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat

<i>[method man:]</i>
i got my mind made up, come on
get in, get into
let it ride, tonight's the night
i got my mind made up, come on
get in, get into
let it ride, tonight's the night

<i>[kurupt:]</i>
well i comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylactics
for protection so my fuckin' sac won't collapse
cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the x-rays
sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave
i wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' mc's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
electrifyin' like thunder, i'm just too much
rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch
i'm an, mc with lyrics that's the fuckin' bombay
you got ten steps before instant death like bai mei
my rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind
as the deadly virus spread through your head like sand palm
there's no escape, nah, i ain't blastin'
i use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin''
opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
why is that? cause smilin' faces deceive
you best believe: to mc's, i'm the deadliest disease
my thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
your whole camp's under siege and i'm jason voorhees
in the heat of the night is when i defeat and ignite mics
my verbal snipe your vocabs on site
i'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
so all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
you already have an idea about the superior sphere
the greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator
i rock from here to there, to philly and back
to la on the spot where i rock and bust like straps
as your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

<i>[method man:]</i>
fuck you losers, while you fake jacks, i makes manoeuvres
like hitler, stickin' up jews with german lugers
the mr. meth-tical from staten isle
will be back after this message, don't touch the dial
rarely do you see an mc out for justice
got my gun powder and my musket, blaow
melons get swellings, i paint mental pictures like magellan
half of my clan's repeat felons
niggas best protect they joints for nine-nickel
man, i stay on point like icicles
now who wanna test tical, then touch tical
all up in your motherfuckin' mouth
headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with al doogie
method man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
better take one and pass or that's that ass
your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
johnny blaze out to get loot like johnny cash
play a game of russian roulette and have a blast

<i>[redman:]</i>
lyrical gats spittin' the criminal tactics
non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
let's face it, there's no replacement
taste this mad underground basement shit i'm laced with
avalanche on your whole camp when i'm spliffted
funk doctor who, spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
i got connects like federal express
to get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
got the clear spot from the rear block
to bust 'til every nigga here drop, men i fear not
hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
since your crew suit you to shift, now you claim that your gears locked
whiff this underground cannabis
i'm dangerous like john the bomb analyst
flip mc's like ki's
my degrees freeze consecutively like epmd lp's
lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
so i erase the whole front row at the wake
i planned my escape in case jake wann' snake bust it
i'm the one pushin' the hearse in the first place
confidence for you shaky-ass folks
pump for rockafeller for the day he got smoked
choke off this antidote, got you ope
get roast by my lyrical billy dee .forty-five colt
and i'm out for nine-nickel

"free twopac" is all that's on a nigga's mind
but at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
so i'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
and put together a million march for some gangsta shit

<i>[twopac:]</i>
so now they got us laced
two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
bitches get ready for the throw down
the shit's about to go down
me and snoop about to clown
i'm losin' my religion
i'm vicious on these stool pigeons
you might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
niggas be actin' like they savage
they out to get the cabbage
i've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

<i>[snoop dogg:]</i>
i've got a pit named petey, she nigerina
i've got a house out in the hills right next to chino
and i think i've got a black bimmer
but my dream's to own a fly casino
like bugsy siegel, and do it all legal
and get scooped up by the little homie in the regal
it feels good to you, baby-bubba
you see, this is for the g's and the keys, motherfucker

<i>[twopac:]</i>

motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the west side
and i can make you famous

bow down in the presence of a boss player

you might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
you doin' your job every day
and then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray

schemes for currency and dough-related
affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it

have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
let the hoes that i used to know
from way before kiss me from my head to my toe
give me a paper and a pen so i can write about my life of sin
a couple bottles of gin in case i don't get in
tell all my people i'm a ridah
nobody cries when we die, we outlaws, let me ride
until i get free, i live my life in the fast lane
got police chasing me
to my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
niggas that guided me through back in the old school
pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
see, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
and brothers, miss ya while your gone
you left your nigga on his own. how long we mourn?
life goes on

how many brothers fell victim to the streets?

life goes on homie
gone on, cause they passed away
niggas doing life, niggas doing fifty and sixty years and shit
i feel ya, nigga. trust me, i feel ya
you know what i mean
last year we poured out liquor for ya
this year nigga, life goes on
we're gonna clock now
get money, evade bitches, evade tricks, give playa haters plenty of space, and basically just represent for you baby
next time you see your niggas, you're gonna be on top, nigga
they're gonna be like, "goddamn, them niggas came up"
that's right, baby, life goes on and we up out this bitch

only god can judge me now

<i>[twopac:]</i>
perhaps i was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
i couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
will i succeed? paranoid from the weed
and hocus pocus, i try to focus, but i can't see
and in my mind i'm a blind man doin' time
look to my future, 'cause my past is all behind me
is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
i've been trapped since birth, cautious 'cause i'm cursed
and fantasies of my family in a hearse
and they say it's the white man i should fear
but it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
i can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
jealousy inside, make 'em wish i died
oh my lord, tell me what i'm livin' for
everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on heaven's door
and all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
and everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
'cause the media is full of dirty tricks

i hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' i can make it
got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
still i can't breathe, something's evil in my iv
'cause everytime i breathe i think they killin' me
i'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
i wake up stranglin', tangled in my bed sheets
i call the nurse 'cause it hurts to reminisce
how did it come to this? i wish they didn't miss 
somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
'cause even thugs cry, but do the lord care?
try to remember, but it hurts
i'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
i'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
there's a ghetto up in heaven and it's ours
"black power!" is what we scream
as we dream in a paranoid state
and our fate is a lifetime of hate
dear mama, can you save me? and fuck peace
'cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
no more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
and they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
mr. police, please try to see
that there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me

would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
he gon' get me first, if i don't get him fool start prayin'
ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
so judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
that's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
after talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
tellin' them niggas, "you can fade him," punk i wish you would
it be them same motherfuckers in your face
that'll rush up in your place to get your safe
knowin' you on that paper chase
grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
my new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
bitch, remember twopac and four-tay
them same two brothers dodgin' bullets representin' the bay
pac, when you was locked down
that's when i'll be around
start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
that's why they ride the bandwagon
still be draggin' sellin' lies
don't think i don't see you haters, i know y'all in disguise

<i>[twopac:]</i>

semi-automatic mac-eleven just to scare niggas
pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday 
and feared men grow on trees
criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
so niggas whisper when they mention
machiavelli was my tutor donald goines, my father figure
mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
henceforth, we thug niggas and we came in packs
every one of niggas strapped sippin' on âyak

quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line 
you was just a little smaller but you still rolled
got stretched to y.a. and hit the hood swoll
'member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
on the block, wit'cha glock, trippin' off sherm
collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
oh you's a muslim now? no more dope game
heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
it seems i lost my little homie, he's a changed man
hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
when i talk about money all you see is the struggle
when i tell you i'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
congratulations on the wedding, i hope your wife know
she got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
i know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
i used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
and i can see us after school, we'd bomb
on the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
go toe to toe when it's time to roll you got a brother's back
and i can't even trip, cause i'm just laughin' at 'cha
you tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
cause i ain't mad at 'cha

we used to be like distant cousins
fightin', playin' dozens, whole neighborhood buzzin'
knowin' that we wasn't
used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
i'm gettin' blitzed and i reminisce on all the times we shared
besides, bumpin' 'n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
in time we'd learned to live a life of crime
rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
i caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
and even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
don't give nobody no coochie while i'll be locked up state
i kiss my momma, goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
said i'll return but i gotta fight the fate's arrived
don't shed a tear, cause momma i ain't happy here
i blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
they got me goin' mad
i'm knockin' busters on they backs, in my cell, thinkin'
"hell, i know one day i'll be back"
as soon as i touch down
i told my girl i'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
the homies wanna kick it, but i'm just laughin' at 'cha
cause you's a down ass bitch and i ain't mad at 'cha

well guess who's movin' up, this nigga's ballin' now
bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
he went from nothing to lots, ten carats to rock
went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
he's mr. local-celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
see, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
so full of pain while the weapons blaze
gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
cause crime pays and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
you'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
so many changed on me, so many tried to plot
that i keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'til god return me to my essence
cause even as an adolescent, i refuse to be a convalescent
so many questions and they ask me if i'm still down
i moved up out of the ghetto, so i ain't real now?
they got so much to say, but i'm just laughin' at 'cha
you niggas just don't know, but i ain't mad at 'cha

my lyrics bang like a crip or blood
nigga what! it ain't nothing but a party when we thug
and there i was, a young nigga with heart

pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
d-r-e you got me heated
my words like a penitentiary dick
hitting bitches where it's most needed
money and weed, alize and hennessy
to my thug niggas in lock down: witness me

my enemies deceased, die like a bitch

nigga, i holla at these hoes and see how many i can go through
look to the star, and visualize my debut

said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug!
said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

was a nice middle-class nigga
but no one knew the evil he'd do when he got a little bigger
you'd often find him blazed, for puffing on a newport
plotting on a another way to catch a case
was only sixteen, yet convicted as a felon
with a bunch of old niggas, but you the only one ain't tellin'
i tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
you tell me it's a man's world, play the rules
and fade fools, break rules until we major
blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
was raised up, commence to money-makin' tactics
it's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
my finger's on the trigger
tell the lord to make way for another straight thug nigga
i'm sitting, getting buzzed, looking for some love
from the homies, âcause shorty wanna be a thug

said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
one day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he's wanna be, said he's wanna be
one day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

straight from the hall to the pen
an adolescent nigga standing way higher than six feet ten
he carried weight, like a mack truck
gonna bust on playa haters, if them mothafuckas act tuff
then that's when, a lethal weapon with the razor
this little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
no one could figure, when the guns blast, pull the trigger
could take the life of a young nigga, guns bigger
no mother and father, you see, the nigga's all alone
old timers my role model, the war zone
been laced with this game 'til it's a part of me
my heart don't beat no fear, and that ain't hard to see
the future is looking dim
i'm tryin' to make a profit out of living in this sin
i'm in the dark, getting buzzed, looking for some love
out with the homies, âcause shorty wanna be a thug

said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
one day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

shorty's gonna be a thug
little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas
gotta stay sharp, nigga, play your part!
got plenty of time (you bad mothafuckas)
you only get three mistakes, and then it's life, big baby
(niggas craaazy) watch the signs!
damn, nigga! sixteen, nigga?
sixteen?! too bad, mothafuckers

how could you do me like that?
i took ya family in
i put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again
and now you let the fear put your ass in a place
complicated to escape, it's a fool's fate
without your word you're a shell of a man
i lost respect for ya, nigga
we can never be friends
i know i'm runnin' through your head now
what could you do?
if it was up to you, i'd be dead now

and then i hit the studio, it's time to blow the block up
no hesitation
this information got you contemplatin'
heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
break him and let him see the face of a mental patient
it's a celebration of my criminal elevation, more participation
i want members that call the fifty states
to keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
will i be great, is it my fate?
to live the life of luxury, some niggas bought my tapes
so much jealousy it scares me
so be prepared, cause only the strong survive
life isn't fair (fair)
probably never knew the way it feels to die
so you see come fuck with me, i give that ass a try!

i should've saw the signs, i was blinded
criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
so many brothas framed in this dirty game
it's a shame, so much pressure on my brain while she blame me
secrets in the dark, only her and i know
now i'm sittin' in the state pen', doin' time slow
guess she made a bad decision
that got me livin' just like an animal
i'm caged up in state prison
my niggas dissin' cause hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn
a cemetery full of motherfuckers not knowin'
picture my prophecy i got some attacking me, on top of me
i'm runnin' from the coppers, but never let 'em stop me
cause i'm a soldier
hell, ever since i was a little nigga havin' fantasies of one day getting older
niggas is paranoid, trust; a no no
love is a mystery, fuck the po po
holla at me

you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch

look here, miss thang, hate to salt your game
but you's a money-hungry woman and you need to change
in the locker room, all the homies do is laugh
high fives 'cause another nigga played your ass
it was said you were sleezy, even easy
sleepin' around for what you need, see
it's your thing, and you can shake it how you wanna
give it up free or make your money on the corner
but don't be bad, play the game, get mad and change
then you wonder why these motherfuckers call you names
still lookin' for a way out, and that's okay
i can see you wanna stray, there's a way out
keep your mind on your money, enroll in school
and as the years pass by, you can show them fools
but you ain't tryin' to hear me 'cause you're stuck
you're headin' for the bathroom, 'bout to get tossed up
still lookin' for a rich man, you dug a ditch
got your legs up tryin' to get rich
i love you like a sister, but you need to switch
and that's why they called you bitchâi betcha!

you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitchâi betcha
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitchâi betcha, bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitchâi betcha
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch

you leave your kids with your mama
'cause your headin' for the club
in a skin-tight miniskirt, lookin' for some love
got them legs wide open while you're sittin' at the bar
talkin' to some nigga 'bout his car
i guess he said he had a lexus, what's next?
you headin' to his car for some sex?
i pass by, can't hold back tears inside
'cause lord knows, for years i tried
and all the other people on my block hate your guts
then you wonder why they stare and call you slut
it's like your mind don't understand
you don't have to kill your dreams plottin' schemes on a man
keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin' 
i'm hearin' rumors, so you need to switch
and niggas wouldn't call you bitchâi betcha!

you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitchâi betcha
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitchâi betcha, bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitchâi betcha
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch

i guess times gettin' hard, even harder for you
'cause hey now, got a baby on the way now
more money from the county, and thanks to the welfare
you're about to get your hair done
got a dinner date, can't be late
trick or treat, sweet thang got another trick to meet
the way he did it it was smooth
plottin' while he gamin' you so, baby, peep the rules
i should've seen it in the first case, the worst case
i should've never called you back in the first place
i remember back in high school, baby, you was fast
straight sex when you moved your ass
but now things change, 'cause you don't look the same
let the ghetto get the best of you, baby, that's a shame
caught hiv and now you 'bout to be deceased
and finally be at peace
so where your niggas at now? 'cause everybody left
they stepped, and left you on your own
see, i loved you like a sister, but you died too quick
and that's why we called you bitchâi betcha!

you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitchâi betcha, bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitchâi betcha, bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitchâi betcha, bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch
you wonda why they call you bitch

dear ms. delores tucker, keep stressin' me
fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mind
i figured you wanted to know
you know, why we call them hoes bitches
and maybe this might help you understand
it ain't personal, strictly business, baby, strictly business
so if you wonder why we call you bitch
you wonder why we call you bitch
if you wonder why we call you bitch
you wonder why we call you bitch

"know there's dope being sold", but i ain't the one sellin'

the federales wanna see me dead
niggas put prices on my head
now i got two rottweilers by my bed, i feed 'em lead
now i'm released, how will i live?
will god forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
one life to live, it's so hard to be positive
when niggas shootin' at your crib
mama, i'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
my homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
full grown, finally a man, just schemin' on ways
to put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
just picture me rollin'
flossin' a benz on rims that isn't stolen
my dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
i'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
my nerves is wrecked, heart beatin' and my hands are swollen

packin' forty glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
all that jealousy and envy comin' from my enemies
while i'm sippin' on rã©my
in front of black lexus, chevy's on the roam
'ninety-six big body, sittin' on chrome
as we head up out the zone, stone-facin' is on

will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in vegas
i'm a boss playa, death before i let these bitches break us
last night was like a fantasy, alizã© and hennessy
a hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
told her i was interested, picture all the shit we did
i got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
first you argued, then i fight it, 'til you lick me where i like it
got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it

<i>[kurupt:]</i>
they label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
my fantasies came true with janet on, i'm in a escapade
but did it all, end too soon
all the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
so i assume, since i'm a playa like my nigga syke
then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
my game's trump tight
so i find time to recline
sneak in your room, instant messiah, shit wines of all kinds
i ain't got that much time
so hurry up and pop the dom and let me hit it from behind
since i'm only here for one night
i got to get you hot and heated
play like micheal jackson, and beat it
one more thing i like to mention, i'm done and i'm out
cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
so all the homies round up in the lobby
cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
it's check out time

<i>[natasha walker:]</i>
we gotta go, we gotta go!
we gotta go, we gotta go!
we gotta go, we gotta go!

<i>[big syke:]</i>
hey, i'm livin' the life of a boss playa

my behavior is crazy from what you did to me baby
if walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
i'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
carressin' your thoughts, cause i'm livin' fed, heard what i said?
passion is crashin' the room
from the liquor we consumed i heard a boom
i'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out 'big syke daddy'
we did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
i'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night
five bottles of cristal and i'm still tight
out of sight from 'pac and kurupt
as i get it up, once the doors close, you stuck
in a heaty, sticky situation
get up baby, you ain't on vacation
it's check out time

<i>[natasha walker:]</i>
we gotta go, we gotta go!
we gotta go, we gotta go!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
you fucking with niggas that's insecure
watered down, my shit is pure
write down my number but don't call me 'til you sure
i ain't begging just trying to relocate between your legs
dripping wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
when you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
you straight begging to sex me got you undressing to test me and uh.

<i>[richie rich:]</i>
shut me down if you want, and miss the chance to do it live
when i stroll by, i see that look in yo' eye
you want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
if you scared, go to church, i know it hurts
to find out me and your man be sharing skirts

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i'm hoping you don't take this the wrong way
but your body is banging, got me attracted in a strong way
after a long day of trying to make my songs pay
making love all day against the wall in the hallway
your fantasies come alive, your heart rate
shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
you might think you're happy with him
but that's a lie, so give this thug a try
i'd rather be ya nigga

<i>[twopac:]</i>

my conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
i see you blushing like you want something, come get a taste
of amerikaz most wanted and let's get into some touching, erotic fuckin'
my up and down with no interruptions
have no intentions of busting until you learn your lesson
now many questions are often asked, a drop top, five hundred benz
and plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass

<i>[richie rich:]</i>
you can ride out with spoke coke, to get your lobster and crab
cause all i got is conversation and a gang of stab
and i'ma listen when it hurts, i'ma hang out but never stay
smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to super dave
i'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
that i's the nigga and spoke coke can be the man
he wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
and when i'm on the field keep you on the sidelines

<i>[twopac:]</i>

tongue kissing 'til yo' head swang
i'm so into you, witness a nigga make the bed bang
if it's all mine, then let me know
now scream my name out; do you want it fast or shall i hit it slow?
not to mention, the multiple positions i inflict
a boss player, freaky motherfucker, can i dig?

<i>[richie rich (twopac):]</i>
it's on and popping, now you see what i was seeing
why your eyes rolling? loosen up, girl, i ain't going
nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
while he's stressed out and knock i stretch out the cock
hold the boots, and let a nigga execute
and though you got it right, i'm going home tonight
(you say you don't need a man, but i don't care)
(you're in the presence of a player, i'd rather be ya nigga)

<i>[twopac:]</i>

hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
until i die; live the life of a boss playa
cause even when i'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
the futures in my eyes, cause all i want is cash and thangs
a five-double-oh benz flauntin' flashy rings, uh
bitches pursue me like a dream
been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
it seems, my main thing was to be major paid
the game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
one nigga's gettin' jealous, and motherfuckers die
depend on me like the first and fifteenth
they might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
we got four niggas, in low riders, and ski masks
screamin' thug life every time they pass - all eyes on me

where i spend most of my time, my california grind
watchin' for thievin', i'm cautious, it's like i'm barely breathin'
puttin' a bullet in motherfuckers, give me a reason
see me and hope i'm intoxicated or slightly faded 
you tried to play me, now homicide is my only payment
i'm addicted to currency in this life i lead
why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a g?
for the life of me, i cannot see
how motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
and if you don't like this rhyme 
then bring your big bad ass to california, 'cause we ain't hard to find

hopin' my information, alleviates the hesitation
i can see it clearly now
catch you smilin' through your frown
i'm askin' baby boo are you down
although i know you've heard about my reputation 
across the nation, mr. i-get-around
my temptation got me drippin' wet, perspiration
i'm activated by the moves you're makin'

a straight thug on a mission, until i get what i'm missin'
stop with the beeper, baby, listen
i know you're grown but pay attention

this is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
turn around one more time, heaven ain't hard to find

<i>[danny boy (twopac):]</i>
hea-ven!
(heaven ain't hard to find)
heaven ain't hard to find

heaven ain't hard to find
in fact you can have it just have faith
just like a little kid, still believin' in magic
it takes a lot of sacrifice
with all the lonely nights on tour
i need somebody i can trust in my life
let me apply the brakes 
baby, you're movin' to fast
my conversations are gettin' deeper, but first let me ask
are you afraid of a thug? 
and have you ever made love 
with candles and bubbles sippin' in your tub?
touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
this thug passion help the average man love better
picture me naked and glistenin' beneath the moonlight mist
take a shot of that alizã©, come give me a kiss
and maybe we can be better friends, perhaps we'll be closer
i'll be the thug in your life, baby, and you'll be my soldier
and i know it takes some time and you got a lot of questions on your mind
but relax, in due time

baby, the quicker i'm speakin'
i got a flight out to cabo
let's kick it this weekend
i'm sippin' hennessy and coke
though addicted to weed smoke

oh god, help me, identify me truest thoughts
your hidden motives full of passion
who would have thought?
come holler at me baby, love me for my thug nature
far from a playa hater, label me a money maker,
straight heart breaker
baby we can be friends, i can soup you in my benz
we'll ride, i'll let you floss it for your friends
once we begin 
until the end, it gets better with time
i'm makin' love to your mind, baby

<i>[*crowd noise*]</i>

<i>[press release:]</i>
in today's music news: the ever-controversial twopac shakur has just released another album under the alias "makaveli".
music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement.
although no one knows the exact cause of the new album resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only mr. shakur, but of death row records as well.
nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at twopacâexcuse meâmakaveli's verbal assault on mobb sleep, notorious p.i.g., and several other new york rappers.
jay z, from "hawaiian sophie" fame, big little whatever and several other corny sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release.
the question everybody wants to know is:
why'd they get this nigga started? twopacârather makaveliâwas not available for comment, but released this statement:

<i>[twopac talking:]</i>
it's not about east or west
it's about niggas and bitches, power and money, riders and punks â which side are you on?

<i>[*gunshots followed by several encroaching footsteps*]</i>

these niggas is still fucking talking?
you niggas still breathing? fucking roaches, aight
aight, it's the raid for you cockroaches
punk motherfuckers, this is it (makaveli the don)
killuminati style (all day) (up in your ass)
(bomb first) (outlaw ridahz) solo shit, bring it!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
allow me to introduce first: makaveli the don
hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the holy qur'an
niggas get shook like five-zero
my .forty-five is next to me when we ride for survival
money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
expose snakes 'cause they breed freely
see me ride! located worldwide like the art of graffiti
i think i'm tougher than nitti, my attitude is shitty
born on a dope fiend's titty
in every city you'll find me
look for trouble right behind me
my outlaw niggas down to die for me

niggas ducking from my guillotine stare
i'm right there, my every word a fucking nightmare
get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
this for my dogs down to die for y'all
extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in 'em
cut 'em down, to hell is where we send 'em
my whole team; trained to explode, ride or die
murder motherfuckers lyrically and i'm not gonna cry
me; a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
two big pits, i call them "my bitch-nigga eaters"
and not a whimper until i'm gone
thug life running through my veins, so i'm strong
bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
oh, how do we do these niggas, but i'm not gonna cry
i'm a bad boy killer, jay-z die too
looking out for mobb deep, nigga, when i find you
weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
how many niggas down to die for me? yay-yay
west coast rider, coming right behind ya
should have never fucked with me
i want money, hoes, sex and weed
i won't rest until my road dog's free; bomb first

<i>[twopac:]</i>
we bomb first when we ride
please, reconsider before you die
we ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
but it's my life or your life, and i'ma bomb first
we bomb first when we ride
please reconsider before you die
we ain't even come to fight tonight
but it's my life or your life, and i'ma bomb first

<i>[e.d.i. mean:]</i>
for so many days, in so many ways
we've been ducking strays they delivers
but still we some bad boy killers
got nothing to lose, i gots nowhere to go
i only got one home, see me stranded on death row
with outlawz, it's makaveli be the general
and i be a soldier on a mission
sent to do what you'll never do
and that's ride for the cause, yes, i'll die for the cause
you best believe, if i'ma leave this bitch
yo, i'm dying with yours
kamikaze, sicker than a motherfucking nazi
got a little question for that nigga that made "paparazzi"
if you ain't in this rap game
for the motherfucking cash, mane
then what is your motherfucking purpose?
non can serve us
e.d.i. mean, born worthless
that's until the day i decided to bomb first, bitch

<i>[twopac:]</i>
biatch! come on, bring it, down with it!
then we ride
come on, bring it
bomb first then we ride
hey, get that nigga!

<i>[young noble:]</i>

half rapper, half drug kingpin
you're telling fairy tales, dunn
"king of new york" like you the motherfucking one?
but i'm from jers' and we don't play that shit
from the clare down to north bricks, all my niggas flippin' chips, gettin' rich, even though it's hard
trying to creep through these halls and brawls
without scarred by a revolve
with no warning signs, 'cause yo, my man took five
now i'm the young one with the nine ready to put in my time

<i>[twopac:]</i>
shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
we bomb first when we ride
please reconsider 'fore you die
g's and thug niggas on the rise
plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
we bomb first when we ride
please reconsider 'fore you die
g's and thug niggas on the rise
plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first

<i>[start of "hail mary"]</i>
let us pray, my niggas
for we have definitely sinned


<i>[twopac:]</i>
makaveli in this, killuminati

that blows like a twelve-gauge shotty, feel me!
and god said he should send his one begotten son
to lead the wild into the ways of the man

<i>[twopac:]</i>
come with me!
hail mary, nigga, run quick, see
what do we have here now?
do you wanna ride or die?
la la-la-la la la la la

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i ain't a killer, but don't push me
revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
bow down, pray to god, hopin' that he's listenin'
seein' niggas comin' for me
through my diamonds, when they glistenin'
now pay attention: bless me please, father, i'm a ghost
in these killing fields, hail mary, catch me if i go
let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
activate my hate, let it break to the flame
set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
plus, mama told me never stop until i bust a nut
fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, hail mary

<i>[twopac:]</i>
come with me!
hail mary, nigga, run quick, see
what do we have here now?
do you wanna ride or die?
la la-la-la la la la la

<i>[twopac:]</i>
penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
institutionalized, i live my life a product made to crumble
but too hardened for a smile
we're too crazy to be humble; we ballin'
catch me, father, please, âcause i'm fallin' in the liquor store
pass the hennessy, i hear you callin', can i get some more?
hell, 'til i reach hell, i ain't scared
mama checkin' in my bedroom, i ain't there
i got a head with no screws in it, what can i do?
one life to live, but i got nothin' to lose
just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
we all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
to my homeboys in clinton max doin' their bid
raise hell to this real shit and feel this
when they turn out the lights, i'll be there in the dark
thuggin' eternal through my heart; now hail mary, nigga!

<i>[twopac:]</i>

since outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
our enemies die now, walk around half dead
head down, k-blasted off of hennessy and thai chronic
mixed in, now i'm twisted, blistered and high
visions of me, thug-livin', gettin' me by
forever live, and i multiply, survived by thugs
when i die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

<i>[young noble:]</i>
peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
ready to wet the party up
and whoever in that mothafucka, nasty new street slugger

mashin' in a stolen black ac' integra
cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw
that's when i'm deadin' ya, feet first

from a thug to preachin' church
i gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
needin' work, and i ain't the nigga to put you on
âcause word is bond
when i was broke, i had to hustle 'til dawn
that's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
hold your head and stay up
to all my niggas, get your pay and weight up

to live and die in l.a., california
what you say about los angeles?
still the only place for me
it never rains in southern california

<i>[twopac:]</i>
to live and die in l.a.
where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it
everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'
worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
who was a friend is now a ghost in the dark
cold-hearted 'bout it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream
a hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'
plea bargain ain't an option now, so i'm stressin'
cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
making money off of cuss words, writin' again
learn how to think ahead, so i fight with my pen
late night down sunset, likin' the scene
what's the worst they could do to a nigga?
got me lost in hell, to live and die in l.a. on bail

<i>[val young (twopac):]</i>

<i>[twopac:]</i>
it's the city of angels and constant danger
south central l.a. can't get no stranger
full of drama, like a soap opera, on the curb
watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters, i observe
so many niggas getting three strikes, tossed in jail
i swear, the pen right across from hell
i can't cry, 'cause it's on now, i'm just a nigga on his own now
livin' life thug style, so i can't smile
writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
thinking cali just fun and bitches
better learn about the dress code, b's and c's
all them other niggas copycats, these is g's
i love cali like i love women
'cause every nigga in l.a. got a little bit of thug in him
we might fight amongst each other
but i promise you this: we'll burn this bitch down
get us pissed, to live and die in l.a.

black love, brown pride, and the sets again

i'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
remember k-day? weekends, crenshaw, mlk?
automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
gang signs being shown, nigga, love your hood!
but recognize and it's all good
where the weed at? niggas gettin' shermed out
snoop dogg in this mothafucka permed out
m.o.b., big suge in the lo-lo, bounce and turn
dogg pound in the lex with a ounce to burn
got them watts niggas with me, o.f.t.b.
they got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me

god has a plan, and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan through the message of prophecy
god sent jesus into this world to be our savior and that christ is returning someday soon to unfold the wonderful plan of eternity
for my life and your life
as long as we're cooperating with god by accepting jesus christ as our personal lord and savior unless the lord does return in the coming seven days
we'll see you next time here on this week in bible prophecy

twopac, don't start that blasphemy in here!
makaveli, the new breed
and i remember what my pops told me
the new word, follow me
remember what my pops told me

<i>[twopac:]</i>
my family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
strugglin', known to hustle screaming, "fuck they feelings!"
i got advice from my father, all he told me was this
nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!
there's ten rules to the game, but i'll share with you two
know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
now, rule one: get your cash on, m.o.b.
that's money over bitches, cause they breed envy
now rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies
keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies
it seemed a little unimportant, when he told me i smiled
picture jewels being handed to an innocent child
i never knew in my lifetime i'd live by these rules
initiated as an outlaw, studying rules
now papa ain't around, so i gotta recall
or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls
promised if i have a seed, i'ma guide him right
dear lord, don't let me die tonight
i got words for my comrades, listen and learn
ain't nothing free, get back what you earned
no doubt, getting higher than a motherfucker, bless me please
this thug life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah

and i remember what my papa told me
remember what my papa told me, blasphemy

while de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain

<i>[twopac:]</i>
we probably in hell already, our dumb asses not knowing
everybody kissing ass to go to heaven ain't going
put my soul on it, i'm fighting devil niggas daily
plus the media be crucifying brothers severely
tell me i ain't god's son, nigga mom a virgin
we got evicted had to leave the 'burbs, back in the ghetto
doing wild shit, looking at the sun, don't pay
criminal mind all the time, wait for judgment day
they say moses split the red sea
i split the blunt and rolled a fat one up deadly
babylon beware, coming for the pharoah's kids
retaliation, making legends off the shit we did
still bullshittin', niggas in jerusalem waiting for signs
god coming, she's just taking her time (haha)
living by the nile while the water flow
i'm contemplating plots wondering where the thought'll go
brothas getting shot, coming back resurrected
it's just that raw shit, nigga, check it (that raw shit)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
the preacher want me buried, why? cause i know he a liar
have you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire
why you got these kids' minds thinking that they evil?
while the preacher being freaky you say "honor god's people"
should we cry when the pope die? my request
we should cry if they cried when we buried malcolm x
mama, tell me am i wrong, is god just another cop?
waiting to beat my ass if i don't go pop?
memories of a past time, giving up cash to the leaders
knowing damn well they ain't gonna feed us
in my brain how can you explain time in b.c
it's hard enough to live now in these times of greed
they say jesus is a kind man
well, he should understand times in this crime land
my thug nation, do what you gotta do, but know you gotta change. try to find a way to make it out the game
i leave this, and hope god can see my heart is pure
is heaven just another door? i leave this here
i leave this, and hope god see my heart is pure
is heaven just another door? and my people sayâ¦

our father, who art in heaven
hallow be thy name

lead us not into temptation
but deliver us unevil
for god is the kingdom and the power
and the glory forever and ever and ever


in the life we live as thugs
everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
it's hard to be a man
ridin' with my guns in hand

<i>[twopac:]</i>
why explain the game
niggas ain't listenin', stuck in positions
if victims can't stand the heat then stay the fuck out the kitchen
half these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean
itchin', givin' suckers plenty space
have these bitch niggas snitchin'
where are we now, guns found daily
the feds surely hope that they could finally nail me
for sellin' dope they backwards
make track burst, whenever i rap
attack
words bein' known to explode on contact
extreme at times
blinded by my passion and fury
look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry
you'd stay silent if you niggas knew me
truely effective
the shit you heard ain't do me justice
got a death wish, bitch
run but face, being traced, by the infrared beam
it seems niggas ain't recognize my team
ain't nobody holdin' you back, explode the track to confetti
unload it
cause niggas ain't ready
the life of an outlaw

in the life we live as thugs
everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
it's hard to be a man
ridin' with my guns in hand

<i>[twopac:]</i>
code three
attack formation
pull out your pistols
keep an eye out for the devils cause they itchin' to get you
merciless madman screamin' kamikaze in tongue
automatic gunfire makin' all my enemies run
who should i call when i'm shot and bleedin'
indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream
dope got me hatin' fiends
scheme with my team, just a chosen few
my foes victim of explosives
come closer
exhale the fumes
we got memories fadin' fast
a slave for cash
accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
don't look now. how you like it, raw
niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws
never surrender
death before dishonor, stay free
i'm thugged out
fuck the world cause this is how they made me
scarred but still breathin'
believe in me and you could see the victory
a warrior with jewels
will you picture me?
life of and outlaw

in the life we live as thugs (no doubt)
everybody fuckin' with us (yes!), so can't you see (life of an outlaw)
it's hard to be a man (soldiers in position, attack formation)
ridin' with my guns in hand
(no retreat, no surrender)

too high strung to lend help

you know we lost hope and we needin' it
wit' the evil it's forever
but it might be low down, scandalous

no doubt
outlaw
outta my mind, outta time

<i>[twopac:]</i>
last year was a hard one, but life goes on
hold my head against the wall, learnin' right from wrong
they say my ghetto instrumental, detrimental to kids
as if they can't see the misery in which they live
blame me for the outcome, ban my records â check it
don't have to bump this, but please respect it
i took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
turned into a plus, now they stuck livin' blinded
hennessy got me feelin' bad, time to stop drinkin'
rollin' in my drop-top jag, what's that cops thinkin'?
sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
i came a long way, but still i got so far to go
dear mama, don't worry; i'ma watch for snakes
tell setchu that i love her, but it's hard today
i got the letter that she sent me, and i cried for weeks
this what came out when i tried to speak â all i heard wasâ¦

i see bloods and crips runnin' up the hill
lookin' for a better way
my brothers and sisters, it's time to bail
'cause even thug niggas pray
hopin' god hear me, i entered the game
look how much i changed
i'm no longer innocent â casualties of fame
made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
and i swear i seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
when i gave her the keys to her own house, this your land
your only son done became a man
watchin' time fly, i love my people, do or die
but i wonder why we scared to let each other fly
june one-six, 'seven-one, the day
mama pushed me out her womb, told me, "nigga, get paid!"
no one can understand me â the black sheep
outcasted from my family, now packin' heat
i run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
when he died, i could hear him sayâ¦ (thug life, baby!)

somethin' about the paper with the pictures of the president's head, damn, it's like a motherfuckin' plague that spread
it's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
i keep my head on straight, makin' money 'cause it's cursed
makin' money makes a difference day by day
so i gotta stay paid, no doubt, day in and day out
this life is like a vicious cycle called fightin' to live
no matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
a lot of my peers didn't make it to the years to come
did life doin' right or did life livin' dumb
who has the answers? i wonder; i turn to my elders
they aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
(why?) 'cause they don't even know
a million things run through my mind (through my mind)
you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time

you go bustin' your fist against a stone wall
you're not usin' your brain
that's what the white man wants you to do
look at you, what makes you ashamed of bein black

<i>[twopac:]</i>
nothin' but love for you my sister
might even know how hard it is, no doubt
bein' a woman, a black woman at that, no doubt
shit, in this white man's world
sometimes we overlook the fact that we be ridin' hard on our sisters
we don't be knowin' the pain we be causin'
in this white man's world
in this white man's world
i ain't sayin i'm innocent in all this
i'm just sayin'
in this white man's world
this song is for y'all
for all those times that i messed up or we messed up

<i>[twopac:]</i>
dear sister, got me twisted up in prison i miss ya
cryin' lookin' at my niece's and my nephew picture
they say don't let this cruel world get ya, kinda suspicious
swearin' one day you might leave me, for somebody that's richer
twist the cap off the bottle, i take a sip and see tomorrow
gotta make it if i have to beg or borrow
readin' love letters; late night, locked down and quiet
if brothers don't receive they mail best believe we riot
eatin' jack-mack, starin' at the walls of silence
inside this cage where they captured all my rage and violence
in time i learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
apologizes to my true sisters, far from bitches
help me raise my black nation, reparations are due
it's true, caught up in this world i took advantage of you
so tell the babies how i love them, precious boys and girls
born black in this white man's world - and all i heard was

who, knows what tomorrow brings
in this world, where everyone's blind?
and where to go, no matter how far i'll find
to let you know, that you're not alone

<i>[twopac:]</i>
only thing they ever did wrong (yes!, yes!) was bein' born black (no doubt), in this white manâs world.
all my ghetto motherfuckers be proud to be black if you proud to have this shit like this, cause ain't nobody got it like this (all my little black seeds, born black in the white man'z world).
all these motherfuckers wanna be like us.
they all wanna be like us, to be the have naughts: all hail.
god bless the child that can hold his own, no motherfuckin' doubt

<i>[twopac:]</i>
bein' born with less, i must confess only adds on to the stress
two gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest
shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
i pass his casket gently askin', is there heaven for g's
my homeboy's doin' life, his baby momma be stressin'
sheddin' tears when her son, finally ask that questions
where my daddy at? mama why we live so poor
why you crying? heard you late night through my bedroom door
now do you love me mama? why they keep on calling me nigga?
get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when i'm bigger
and still thuggin' in his jail cell, missing my block
hearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishing they'd stop
proud to be black but why we act like we don't love ourselves
don't look around busta (you sucka) check yourselves
know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
we still struggling, in this white man's world

<i>[twopac:]</i>
who, knows what tomorrow brings
(born black in this white man's world)
in this world, where everyone's blind?
(in this white man's world)
and where to go, no matter how far i'll find
(in this white man's world)
to let you know, that you're not alone

<i>[*megaphone*]</i>
we must fight, for brother mumia
we must fight, for brother mutulu
and we must fight, for brother ruchell magee
we must fight, for brother geronimo pratt
we must fight, for <i>[?]</i>, zulu, <i>[?]</i>
we must fight, for countless political prisoners
who are locked up falsely by this white man

<i>[twopac:]</i>
so tell me why you
changed to choose a new direction, in the blink of an eye
my time away just made perfection, did you think i'd die
not gon' cry, why should i care
like we holding on to lost love that's no longer there
can you please help me, god bless me please keep my seeds healthy
making all my enemies bleed while my g's wealthy
hoping they bury me with ammunitions, weed, and shells
just in case they trip in heaven - ain't no g's in hell
sister sorry for the pain that i caused your heart
i know i'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart
rest in peace to latasha, lil' yummy, and kato
too much for this cold world to take - ended up bein fatal
every woman in america, especially black
bear with me, can't you see, that we under attack
i never meant to cause drama, to my sister and mama
hope we make it, to better times, in this white man's world

who, knows what tomorrow brings
in world, where everyone's blind?
and where to go, no matter how far i'll find
to let you know, that you're not alone

'ninety-six bonnie and clyde, me and my girlfriend
doing eighty-five when we ride
trapped in this world of sin
born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind

<i>[twopac:]</i>
c'mon, our childhood years, recall the tears, heart laced with venom
smoking sherm, drinking malt liquor, father forgive 'em
me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
fell in love with the struggle
hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
automatic gunfire exorcising all demons
my mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
we bail out to take the jail back, niggas united
our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
touch you in every secret place, i could hardly wait
to bust freely, got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
make the frontpage primetime live on tv

one shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop

my girlfriend: blacker than the darkest night
when niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
i knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
picked you up when you was nine
started out my life of crime with you
bought you some shells when you turned twenty-two
it's true, nothing compares to the satisfaction
that i feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i was too immature to understand your ways
inexperienced back in the days
caused so many arguments and strays
now i realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
being faithful, 'cause now cheating's lethal
we're closer than the hands of time
deeper than the drive of mankind
i trust you dearly, i shoot blind
in time i clock figures, dropping niggas as we rise
we all soldiers in god's eyes
now it's time for war; never leave me, baby
i'm paranoid, sleeping with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
jealous when you hang with the fellas, i wait patiently alone
anticipated for the moment you come home
i'm waiting by the phone, this is true love, i can feel it
i've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
so if you ever need me, call, i'll be there through it all
you're the reason i can stand tall; me and my girlfriend

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i love finger-fucking you, all of a sudden i'm hearing thunder
when you bust a nut, niggas be ducking or taking numbers
love to watch you at a block party, begging for drama
while unleashing on the old-timers, that's on my mama
i would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
the only girl that i adore, everything i'm asking for
talking to me, begging me to just take you around
seventeen, like brandy, you just wanna be down
talking loud when i tell you be quiet
you move the crowd, busting rounds, activating a riot
that's why i love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
after a hit you, break apart, then back to one piece
much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
just hold me down, baby, witness the power
never leave a nigga alone, i love you black or chrome
turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend

i wake up early in the mornin', mind state so military
suckers fantasizin' pictures of a young brother buried
was it me, the weed, or this life i lead?
if daytime is for suckers, then tonight we breathe
out for all that, knowin' that this world bring drawbacks
look how they shiver once i deliver these raw raps
meet me at the cemetery, dressed in black
tonight we honor the dead, those who won't be back
so, if i die, do the same for me, shed no tears
an outlaw thug livin' in this game for years
why worry? hope to god, get me high when i'm buried
knowin' deep inside only a few love me
don't rush me to the gates of heaven
let me picture for a while, how i lived for my days as a child
i wonder now, how do we outlast?
always get cash, stay strong if we all mash; hold ya head!

these felonies be like prophecies
beggin' me to stop, 'cause these
lawyers gettin' money every time they knock us
snatchin' pockets lyrically, suckers flee when they notice
switched my name to makaveli, half the rap game ghost
exposed foes with my hocus-pocus flows, they froze
now suckers idolize my chosen blows
and mo' money mean litigatin', mo' playa hatin'
got a cell at the pen' for me waitin'âis this my fate?
miss me with that misdemeanor thinkin', me fall back?
never that, too much tequila drinkin', we all that
make them understand me? hell nah, this ain't my posse
everyone with me is family, 'cause everybody's got me
watch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livin'
got us all meetin' up in prison

sayin', "please show a playa love"âhold ya head! (hold it!)

indeed, enemies bleed when i hold my chrome
let these words be the last to my unborn seeds

money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
i hope for better days, trouble comes naturally
runnin' from authorities 'til they capture me
and my aim is to spread mo' smiles than tears
utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
maybe mama had it all right, rest yo' head
tradin' conversations all night, bless the dead
to the homies that i used to have that no longer roll
catch a brother at the crossroads

"alright now, here we go"

tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me?
i smoke a blunt and freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
i'm out the gutter, pick a hero
i'm one hundred and sixty-five and stayin' high 'til i die, my competition's zero
cause i could give a fuck about you, you better duck
go or i'll be forced to hit yo' ass up, i give a fuck
i'm sick inside my mind, why they sweat me?
it's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
niggas know i ain't the one to sleep on, i'm under pressure
gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
word to god i've been ready to die since i was born
i don't want no shit but niggas trip and, yo, it's on
open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
it's a man's world, niggas get played, another stray
hope i live to see another day, hey!
i'm gettin' sweated by these undercovers
who can i trust, got my mama stressin', thinkin' it's a drug bust
gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
we livin' a drug life, thug life, each day could be my last
will i blast when it's time to shoot? don't even ask
that's the consequences when ya livin' fast
six bricks of tricks, for my niggas, i gotta come up
and recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
is it a bust? i hear the sirens, run for cover
over the fence and open fire

"alright now, here we go"

these motherfuckers on my ass i'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
i'm comin' round the corner like i'm magic
doin' ninety on the freeway, and hittin' switches
in a high speed chase with these punk bitches
don't turn around i ain't givin' up, cause they don't worry me
pussy ass bitches better bury me
runnin' outta gas time to park it, i'm on foot
we in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? haha
i got away cause i'm clever
went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
i watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin' loogies
at the coppers that pursue me, beotch!
i be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker
open fire on you bustas

"alright now, here we go"

don't try to follow me, i'm headed outta state
i gotta pay my fuckin' bills, so i'm transportin' weight
change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin'
droppin' keys like they stolen, hehe
tell me who do you fear? i'm outta town until the coast is clear
enough dope to last a year
they got me runnin' from the police, nowhere to go
with the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
but i ain't goin' alive, i'd rather die than be a convict
i'd rather fire on my target
i hit the corner doin' ninety, ah shit!
them bitches right behind me
they take a shot and hit my fuckin' tires
now, jump out the car then i open fire, sucka!

hahahaha! thug life, bitch! goin' out like that


are you still down? <i>[threex]</i>

now up and at 'em it's on, i was raised to be strong
and mama told me be a thug, since the day i was born
i came up, out the gutter never changed my style
got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
and the fame was a plot to try to change me
and what's strange is, nobody knew my name 'fore it came
now the whole world is calling me a killer
all i ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
all the time i was ballin', never heard my friends callin'
couldn't stop myself from fallin', i'm all in
shit's gettin' sleazy, believe me
best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
cause in my mind, i see sunshine, i thought
i didn't have to run, now i'm duckin' from the gun yellin' "one time!"
take your time to feel my record
and if you did, chill a second
my blind method, will still wreck it
my young homies stay strong
i wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone
are you still down?

raise 'em up ... are you still down?
raise 'em up ... are you still down?
raise 'em up ... are you still down?
raise 'em up ... are you still down?
raise 'em up ... are you still down?

i'm gettin' high, so a nigga think, he touch the sky
turn tough inside, in the rush to die
livin' life as a thug, time to face the truth
what's goin' on with the wasted youth, please god
come and save me, had to work with what ya gave me
and got a nigga goin' crazy
i can't read the signs
i'm blind, but a nigga know he need his nine
cause times, they ain't what they used to be
ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
and my niggas on the streets, man, listen
cause these ain't the old days
ain't no way, i'mma bustin' my ass and gettin' no pay
it seems i can't find my focus and homie, i ain't paranoid
i seen the future and it's hopeless
lord knows, it's hard on a young scrub
it seems i had less problems when i slung drugs
but since i'm tryin' lace, niggas with the game
wanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name
and them same motherfuckers that was callin' me
will be the first to turn their backs, when i'm fallin', see
i should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
this one nigga got the town in fear, but are you still down

raise 'em up ... are you still down?
raise 'em up ... are you still down?
raise 'em up ... are you still down?
raise 'em up ... are you still down?
raise 'em up ... are you still down?

i wrote this for my critics and my enemies
last year ya used to love me, huh, remember me
now ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix
i'm stayin' sharp, got no time for them tricks
and now they wonder if i'm goin' to jail
just as well, cause my life on the streets - a livin' hell
and i can't sleep, they got my phone tapped
and mercy lord, come get me 'fore they hurt me
ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
my daddy left me alone and so i'm angry
i never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, "baby, it's on!"
and now i'm hustlin' and bustlin' bones
never said it came easy, i'm makin' cheese
buyin' all the things on tv, and gettin' skeezed
wish my homeboys could see me now
little bad motherfucker runnin' wild through the town
please tell me, are you still down?

and all the time, my mind's full of thoughts of ends
i'm still rollin' my bucket but i bought me a benz (tadow)
my fake friends say they love me but i know they lie
cause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide
my mama cried when they took me off to jail
only me inside the cell, straight locked up in this hell
i hear some sucker screamin' like the demon's inside
will 'em away in the mornin', only the strong survive
i cry, but in my own way swallow my pride
pick a reason to hide from all the niggas that die
cemetery full of brothers i buried it's goin' down
even now i wonder will i still be around
my hometown is the gutter i was born a wild
i came up out this dust with my heartless style

these, niggas don't know my style

and pete and lee young g's with a gift of gab
tryna hook up with the hookers who was quick to stab remember mama's cookin', no school straight hookin'
and tryin' to get with light skinned cause she good lookin'
and jumpin' over turnstiles cause we ain't payin'
call the cuties cuss words but we only playin'
i'm prayin' i can get a buck no luck
i had to move around a lot cause my moms was stuck
i had family but i was way too wild
had to move to the west to regain my style

quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)

in ninety-four, and more
what do we do? for us?


i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

i was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit
talk much shit, 'cause i never had shit
i could remember being whupped in class
and if i didn't pass, mama whupped my ass
was it my fault papa didn't plan it out?
broke out, left me to be the man of the house
i couldn't take it, had to make a profit
found a block, got a glock, and i clock grips
makin' g's was my mission
movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
and why must i sock a fella?
just to live large like rockefeller?
first you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
if you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
if you're not from the town then don't pass through
'cause some o.g. fools might blast you
it ain't right, but it's long overdue
we can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
i want g's so you label me a criminal
and if i die, i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

here on earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
a bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
and even when you take the shit
move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
ask rodney, latasha, and many more
it's been going on for years, there's plenty more
when they ask me, "when will the violence cease?"
when your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
niggas had enough time to make a difference
bear witness, on our own business
fuck the guard, 'cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
first we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
so we loot, please don't shoot when you see
i'm takin' from them 'cause for years they would take from me
now the tables have turned around
you didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down
and now bush can't stop the hit
predicted the shit in twopacalypse
and for once i was down with niggas
felt good in the hood being around the niggas
yeah, and for the first time everybody let go
and the streets is death row, i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
(yeah), i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

i see no changes, all i see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
we under, i wonder what it take to make this
one better place, let's erase the wasted
take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
and only time we deal is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
and though it seems heaven-sent
we ain't ready to have a black president
huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
i wake up in the mornin' and i ask myself
is life worth livin'? should i blast myself?
i'm tired of being poor and, even worse, i'm black
my stomach hurts, so i'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a negro
pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
rather i'd be dead than a po' nigga
let the lord judge the criminals
if i die, i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
and i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
(just think if niggas decide to retaliate)
(soldier in eye's)
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto


the only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
pray to my god everyday, but he don't listen
the poverty bothers me, but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
listen! i can hear her crying in the bedroom
praying for money but never think would she be dead soon
am i wrong for wishing i was somewhere else
i'm thirteen, can't feed myself
can i blame daddy cause he left me?
wish he would've hugged me
too much like him, so my mama don't love me
on my own at a early age, i'm getting paid
and i'm strapped, so i'll never be afraid
where did i go astray?
i'm hanging in the back streets
running with g's and dope fiends, will they jack me?
can't turn back, my eyes on the prize
i got nothing to lose, everybody gotta die
say good-bye to the bad guy
that one, you fucked, when you passed by
buck-buck from a glock let the glass fly
do or die walk a mile in my shoes
then you'd be crazy too

with nothing to lose
<i>[the d.o.c:]</i> i got raw when i came to cali
got nothing to lose
<i>[ice cube:]</i> that's why i got gang-related rhymes

got nothing to lose
<i>[the d.o.c:]</i> i got raw when i came to cali
got nothing to lose
<i>[ice cube:]</i> that's why i got gang-related rhymes
<i>[threex]</i>

i thank the lord for my many blessings
though i'm stressing keep a vest for protection
from the barrel of a smith and wesson
and all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
ain't nothing separating us from a mac-ten
born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
straight soldier, bucking at them bustas
no matter how you try, niggas never die
we just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
see me striking down the block hitting corners
mobbing like a motherfucker, living like i wanna
ain't no stopping at the red lights, i'm sideways
thug life, motherfucker, crime pays
let the cops put they lights on, chase me, nigga
zig-zagging through the freeway, race me, nigga
in a high speed chase with the law
the realest motherfucker that you ever saw
i'm living raw, til they bury me, don't worry me, i'm high
living like i ain't afraid to die
and if you could walk a mile in my shoes
then you'd be crazy too

with nothing to lose
<i>[the d.o.c:]</i> i got raw when i came to cali
got nothing to lose
<i>[ice cube:]</i> that's why i got gang-related rhymes

got nothing to lose
<i>[the d.o.c:]</i> i got raw when i came to cali
got nothing to lose
<i>[ice cube:]</i> that's why i got gang-related rhymes
<i>[threex]</i>

ain't no escape from a deadly fate
and everyday there's a million black bodies put away
i'm starting to lose hope, it seems everybody's on dope
mama told me to leave, cause she was broke
sometimes i choke on the indo, creeping out the window
alone, on my own, i'm a criminal
got no love from the household
i'm out cold, on the streets screaming 'motherfuck peace!'
i got nothing to lose, and something to prove, what do i do?
live the thug life, nigga, stay true
i wonder when they kill me, is there a heaven for a real g?
lord forgive me, if you feel me
cause all my life i was dirt broke with no hope
little skinny motherfucker wanting dough
i hated cutting suckers with my razor blade
but everyday it's a struggle to get major paid
anyway, it's so hard on a nigga in this city, no pity
and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buying dime
if you could walk a mile in my shoes
then you'd be crazy too

with nothing to lose
<i>[the d.o.c:]</i> i got raw when i came to cali
got nothing to lose
<i>[ice cube:]</i> that's why i got gang-related rhymes

they wonder what type nigga be a thug life nigga
we be the craziest, motherfucker!
you know!
they wonder what type nigga be a thug life nigga
we be the craziest!

"nobody's, closing me out of my business"

case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb
i guess i live life forever jugglin'
but i'll be hustlin' 'til the early mornin' cause i'm strugglin'
like drinkin' liquor make the money come quicker
gettin' pages from my bitch it's time to dick her
i ain't in love with her, i just wanna be the one to hit her
drop off and let the next nigga get her
that's the way it goes, it's time to shake a ho, make the dough
break a ho when it's time to make some mo'
i keep my finger on the trigger of my glock
ridin' down the block lickin' shots at the punk-ass cops
and spittin' game through my mobile phone

and then they offer me a furlough
but what they don't know as soon as i get free i'm killin' five mo'
they asked me if i changed much

little skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch
and all through junior high, we was just gettin' by
and drive-by's robbed my homies of their young lives
i never did cry, and even though i had pain in my heart
i was hopeless from the start
they couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me
the marijuana had my mind gone, it wasn't healthy
i traveled places, caught cases, what a ill year
i felt the pain and the rain, but i'm still here
never did like the police
let the whole world know, now i gets no peace
'cause they chasin' me down
and facin' me now, what do i do?
these things that a thug goes through
and still i rise, so keep your head up
and make your mind strong
it's a struggle every day, but you gotta hold on

hold on, be strong!
hold on, be strong!
hold on, be strong!
when it's on, it's on

there's never a good day, 'cause in my hood they
let they ak's pump strays where the kids play
and every halloween, check out the murder scene
can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
my homies dyin' before they get to see they birthdays
these is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
and even god turned his back on the ghetto youth
i know that ain't the truth, sometimes i look for proof
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
does it matter if you blood or you cuz?
remember how it was?
the picnics and the parties in the projects
small time drinkin', gettin' high with them armies
just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
i'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother
i'm tryin' to tell you when it's on
you gotta keep your head to the sky
and be strong, most of all, hold on

hold on, be strong!
hold on, be strong!
hold on, be strong!
when it's on, it's on

how not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
when this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
we had some problems but we workin at it, and now
the arguments are gettin' loud, i wanna stay
but i can't help from walkin' out just throw it away
just take my hand and understand, if you could see
i never planned to be your man it just wasn't me
but now i'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
i wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
soon as i open up the door with your jealous questions
like where can i be you're killin' me with your jealousy
now my ambition's to be free
i can't breathe, cause soon as i leave, it's like a trap
i hear you callin' me to come back, i'm a sucka for love

just when i thought i broke away and i'm feelin' happy
you try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could i do? so now i'm back
to makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
what if i'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
i'm bout to lose my composure, i'm gettin' close
to packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
tell me who knows, a peaceful place where i can go
to clear my head i'm feelin low, losin control
my heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
when we conspire to conceive, and now
you gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
that's all i need to hear cause i'm leavin', i'm out the do'
never no more will you see me, this is the end

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
as you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
it wasn't always a hit and run relationship
it use to be love, happiness and companionship
remember when i treated you good
i moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
me and you a happy home, when it was on
i had a love to call my own
i shoulda seen you was trouble but i was lost, trapped in your eyes
preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
you had a man and i knew it, you told me
don't worry bout it we can do it now i'm under pressure
make a decision cause i'm waitin', when i'm alone
i'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
i wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
but i need your faith in me, i'm a sucka for love

<i>[eric williams:]</i>
what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up

straight outta oakland, california where we spark it on ya
give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
i remember drinkin' hennessy, smokin' weed
fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
had a partner named snupe, loved to clown a stank
smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
shootin' craps in the alley 'til they chased us off
pour a little for my homies, but don't waste it all
ooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
on my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
havin' house parties in a crowded spot
and you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
lookin' dumb, cause you waitin' for your chance to hump
straight grindin', everybody havin' fun
and it's cool, 'til a fool pull a loaded gun
cause another dude kicked his bacardi over
he had to act a fool, now the party's over
gun shots rang like it's thunder
and everybody bum rushin' and i'm rushin' to get a number
says she got a man but she's lyin'
why? i seen her talkin' to this other guy and
he's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
i ain't trippin', i just hope he get 'em, i got nuttin but love

<i>[dave (twopac):]</i>

(i'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(i'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(i'm down for yours)

i love to go back, to the block i got my game from
and pay respect to the place that i came from
cause uh, old man still drinkin', his breath still stinkin'
he'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin'
but i can't diss him he's my elder
he been livin' here longer what that tell ya?
and little girls playin' double dutch
still blush, cause she don't get in trouble much
it's uh, ponytails and barrettes
i gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
and little boys playin' stick ball, quick y'all
get out the street before they hit y'all
and as i reminisce, i think about my ghetto bliss
and wonder how we came to this
i help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
i can't take what she offers me
and this is how the world could be
this is how the world should be
feels good to be back on the streets
cause i know they got love for me, nuttin but love

when i was young i used to want to be a dealer see
cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
i saw our brothers gettin' rich slangin' crack to folks
and the square's gettin' big for these sack of dope
started thinkin' bout a plan to get paid myself
so i made myself, raised myself
'til the dealer on the block told me, "that ain't cool
you ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool"
i got my game about women from a prostitute
and way back used to rap on the block for loot
i tried to make my way legit, haha
but it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
and uhh, it was funny how i copped out
i couldn't make it in school, so finally i dropped out
my family on welfare
i'm steady thinkin', since don't nobody else care
i'm out here on my own
at least in jail i have a meal and i wouldn't be alone
i'm feelin' like a waste, tears rollin' down my face
cause my life is filled with hate
until i looked around me
i saw nuttin but family, straight up down for me
panthers, pimps, pushers and thugs
hey yo, that's my family tree, i got nuttin but love

<i>[dave (twopac):]</i>
ain't got nuttin but love for ya

death row, that's where mothafuckas is endin' up

dear mama, i'm caught up in this sickness
i robbed my adversaries but slipped and left a witness
wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch?
should i shoot his bitch or make the nigga rich
don't wanna commit murder, but damn, they got me trapped
hawkin' while i'm walkin' and talkin' behind my back
i'm kind of schizophrenic, i'm in this shit to win it
'cause life's a wheel of fortune, here's my chance to spin it
got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
too fuckin' trigger-happy to let them suckers snatch me
niggas gettin' jealous, tryin' to find my stash
whip out the nine, now <i>[?]</i> pump your ass
peter picked a pepper, but i can pick a punk
snatched him like a bitch and threw him in the trunk
the punk thought i was bluffin', but swear i'm nothin' nice
before i take your life, first wrestle with these mites
i listened to his screams, until he went insane
i guess the little mites had finally found his brain
new rovers pull me over, i'm sentenced to the pen
remember that little bird? he snitched and told a friend
it's trouble on my mind, i'm with the old-timers
and fuck five-zero! blaow, blaow! turn 'em into forty-niners

bye bye, i was never meant to live
can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
bye bye, i was never meant to be
livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
bye bye, and i got no place to go
where they find me; sixteen on death row

dear mama, these cops don't understand me
i turned to a life of crime, 'cause i came from a broken family
my uncle used to touch me, i never told you that
scared what you might do, i couldn't hold you back
i kept it deep inside, i done let it fuel my anger
i'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
the brother in my cell is sixteen as well
it's hard to adapt when you're black
and you're trapped in a living hell
i shouldn't have let him catch me
instead of livin' sad in jail i could've died free and happy
and my cellmate's raped on the norm
and passed around the dorm
you can hear his asshole gettin' torn
they made me an animal, can't sleep
instead of countin' sheep, niggas countin' cannibals
and that's how it is in the pen
turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
my mama, pray for me; tell the lord to make way for me
prepare any day for me (why?)
'cause when they come for me they find a struggler
to the death i take the breath from your jugular
the trick is to never lose hope
i found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope; sixteen on death row

bye bye, i was never meant to live
can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
bye bye, i was never meant to be
livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
bye bye, and i got no place to go
where they find me; sixteen on death row

dear mama, they sentenced me to death
today's my final day, i'm countin' every breath
i'm bitter 'cause i'm dying, so much i haven't seen
i know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at sixteen
i got beef with a sick society
that doesn't give a shit
and they too quick to say goodbye to me
they tell me the preacher's there for me
he's a crook with a book
that mothafucka never cared for me
he's only here to be sure i don't drop a dime to god
about the crimes he's committin' on the poor
and how can these people judge me?
they ain't my peers, and in all these years
they ain't never love me
i never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
to keep a nigga in the state pen
and to my homies out buryin' mothafuckas
steer clear of these aryan mothafuckas
'cause once they got you locked up
they got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot up
i'm convinced self-defense is the way
please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
i wish i would've known while i was out there
now i'm straight headin' for the chair

bye bye, i was never meant to live
can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
bye bye, i was never meant to be
livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
bye bye, and i got no place to go
where they find me; sixteen on death row

sixteen on death row, death row
death row, death row
sixteen on death row, death row, death row
it's to all my partners
in the penitentiaries; sixteen on death row


i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

i was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit
talk much shit, 'cause i never had shit
i could remember being whupped in class
and if i didn't pass, mama whupped my ass
was it my fault papa didn't plan it out?
broke out, left me to be the man of the house
i couldn't take it, had to make a profit
found a block, got a glock, and i clock grips
makin' g's was my mission
movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
and why must i sock a fella?
just to live large like rockefeller?
first you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
if you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
if you're not from the town then don't pass through
'cause some o.g. fools might blast you
it ain't right, but it's long overdue
we can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
i want g's so you label me a criminal
and if i die, i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

here on earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
a bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
and even when you take the shit
move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
ask rodney, latasha, and many more
it's been going on for years, there's plenty more
when they ask me, "when will the violence cease?"
when your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
niggas had enough time to make a difference
bear witness, on our own business
fuck the guard, 'cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
first we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
so we loot, please don't shoot when you see
i'm takin' from them 'cause for years they would take from me
now the tables have turned around
you didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down
and now bush can't stop the hit
predicted the shit in twopacalypse
and for once i was down with niggas
felt good in the hood being around the niggas
yeah, and for the first time everybody let go
and the streets is death row, i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
(yeah), i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

i see no changes, all i see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
we under, i wonder what it take to make this
one better place, let's erase the wasted
take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
and only time we deal is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
and though it seems heaven-sent
we ain't ready to have a black president
huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
i wake up in the mornin' and i ask myself
is life worth livin'? should i blast myself?
i'm tired of being poor and, even worse, i'm black
my stomach hurts, so i'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a negro
pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
rather i'd be dead than a po' nigga
let the lord judge the criminals
if i die, i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
and i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
(just think if niggas decide to retaliate)
(soldier in eye's)
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto
i wonder if heaven got a ghetto

pssst... psssssst... ayo
are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever?
tell me, which one?

they wanna bury me, i'm worried -- i'm losin' my mind
look down the barrel of my nine, and my vision's blurry
fallin' to pieces, am i guilty? i pray to the lord
but he ignores me, unfortunately, âcause i'm guilty
show me a miracle, i'm hopeless
i'm chokin' off marijuana smoke
with every toke it's like i'm losin' focus
fallin' to sleep while i'm at service, when will i die?
forever paranoid and nervous, because i'm high
don't mention funerals, i'm stressin' and goin' nutty
and reminiscin' 'bout them niggas that murdered my buddy
i wonder: when will i be happy? ain't nothin' funny
flashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money
where am i goin'? i discovered, can't nothin' save me
my next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
happy birthday, bitch, you know you shouldn't have did it
everybody's dyin', am i next? who can i trust?
will they be g's, and they look at me before they bust?
or will they kill me while i'm sleepin'?
two to the head while i'm in bed
leakin' blood on my satin sheets
is there a heaven for a baller?
i'm gettin' suspicious of this bitch
the line's busy everytime i call her
now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
i check the house before i bone, so we all alone
after i nut i hit the highway -- see ya later!
to all the players, watch the fly way a nigga played her
the bitch is tellin' all her homies
that i can fuck her like no other
now them other bitches wanna bone me
i'm under pressure, gettin' drunk, somebody help me
i drink a fifth of hennessy, i don't think it's healthy
i see my enemies, they creepin', don't make me blast
i watch the five-zero's roll, the motherfuckers pass
by me like they know me, smilin' as they laugh
i put up my middle finger, then i dash
niggas don't like me, âcause i'm thuggin'
and every day i'm a hustler lookin' to get paid
they wanna bury me, i'm worried -- no need to lie
i pray to god i don't scream when it's time to fry
nowhere to rest, i'm losin' homies -- ain't that a bitch?
when i was rich i had clout, now a nigga's lonely
i put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
i see visions of me dead, lord, are you there?
then tell me, am i lost? âcause i'm lonely
i thought i had friends, but in the end a nigga dies lonely
nowhere to run, i'm in terror, and no one cares
a closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
is there a future for a killer? i change my ways
but still that don't promise me the next day
so i stay thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin'
i'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness
they wonder if i'm hellbound
well, hell can't be worse than this, âcause i'm in hell now
don't make me hurt you, i don't want to, but i will
seen motherfuckers killed over phone bills
never will i die, i'll be back
reincarnated as a motherfuckin' mac
-eleven, âcause in heaven there's no shortage on g's
i'm tellin' you now: you motherfuckers don't know me

"only fear of death..." "you ghetto niggas"

<i>[twopac:]</i>
god bless the dead, and buried
nigga, don't worry if you see god first
tell him shit got worse, i ain't mad
i know you representin the crew
and i can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
if you a baller, money went as quick as it came
my role models - gone or they locked in the pen
straight hustlers, caught up in the whirlwind
the other day, i thought i seen my homeboy biggy
sayin shit don't stop nigga no pity
we all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams
money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
in the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind
i was addicted to tryin, never meant to do time
my epitaph, will read, was the last of g's
kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
god bless the dead

<i>[twopac:]</i>
god bless the dead <i>[fourx]</i>

<i>[twopac:]</i>
man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
i been caught up in this game
ever since i was a little motherfucker wantin to hang
i can see 'em in my head, pow
memories of my nigga but he dead now
lookin back in my yearbook, all the years took
half my peers, they're stretched for years
and if i die will they all shed tears?
two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
paranoid got me lookin in the mirror
behind me, life without my nine, i'd rather do the time
see i'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
fuck the police and all the courts, same way they fucked us
and why the hell am i locked in jail
they let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
in my mind i can see it comin
and all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin
i keep a gun and never run unless i'm comin at ya
cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
god bless the dead

god bless the dead <i>[fourx]</i>

<i>[twopac:]</i>
rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed too early

i pray before i go to sleep - "dear god"
say my grace before i start to eat, cause times is hard
so i'm droppin to my knees, oh why?
why you had to take my nigga with the rock-a-bye?
you had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, uzi weighin a ton
niggas terrified of drama from the young gun
hearin that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
but it's mind blowin so i'm flowin goin crazy
slip for cock the gun but he didn't run like a punk
he shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
but spunk is what he had, kid, i'd ratha attack big
now ya bout to smell the aftermath of what the mag did
wannabe suckers wanna test, i'm tellin you, yes
the teflon's bout to rip through your fuckin vest
guess who? i'll make a mess of your crew quick
the spirit biggy smallz and the thuggin' clique, yeah

<i>[stretch:]</i>
god bless the dead <i>[fourx]</i>


(what y'all want?)
unconditional love (no doubt)
talking bout the stuff that don't wear off
it don't fade
it'll last for all these crazy days
these crazy nights
whether you wrong or you right
i'm a still love you
still feel you
still there for you
no matter what (hehe)
you will always be in my heart
with unconditional love

come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
all my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
how many caskets can we witness
before we see it's hard to live this life without god, so we must ask forgiveness
ask mama why i got this urge to die
witness the tears falling free from my eyes, before she could reply
though we were born without a silver spoon
my broken down tv, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
one day i hope to make it, a player in this game
mama don't cry, long as we try, maybe things change
perhaps it's just a fantasy
a life where we don't need no welfare and share with our whole family
maybe it's me that caused it, the fighting and the hurtin'
in my room crying cause i didn't want to be a burden
watch mama open up her arms to hug me
and i ain't worried bout a damn thang, with unconditional love

in this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
though things change, the future's still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
<i>[twox]</i>

just got the message you've been calling all week
been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
but you know, with you and me it's on g
we could never be enemies
cause you been such a good friend to me
where would i be without my dogs
no wonder why when times get hard
cause it ain't easy being who we are
driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
so i proceed to make gs, eternally in my mission
is to be more than just a rap musician
the elevation of today's generation, if could make 'em listen
prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
when we make something out of nothing
no pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good
if they could cut out all the busting
the liquor and the weed the cussing
sending love out to my block
the struggle never stops (unconditional love)

in this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
though things change, the future's still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
<i>[twox]</i>

i'll probably never understand ya ways
with everyday i swear i hear ya
trying to change your ways while getting paid at the same time
just had a baby with the same eyes
something inside, please let me die these are strange times
how come i never made it
maybe it's the way i played it in my heart
i knew one day i gotta be a star
my hopes and all my wishes
so many vivid pictures, and all the currency
i'll never even get to see
this fast life soon shatters
cause after all the lights and screams
nothing but my dreams matter
hoping for better days
maybe a peaceful night, baby don't cry
cause everything gonna be alright
just lay your head on my shoulder
don't worry bout a thing, baby
girl i'm a soldier (huh)
never treated me bad, no matter who i was
you still came with that, unconditional love

<i>[repeat to fade:]</i>
in this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
though things change, the future's still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

outlaw motherfuckers die by the random shots
we all die in the end, so revenge we swore
i was all about my ends; fuck friends and foes!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
troublesome nigga, outlawz
put it down to the fullest
spittin' rhymes and bullets, ha ha
we troublesome
y'all know what time it is
call the punk police, they can't stop us
niggas run the streets, we troubleshit

gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
we guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
death before dishonor, bet i bomb on first
niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
screaming, "fuck all ya'll niggas!" in swahili
pistol packin', fresh out of jail, i ain't goin' back
release me to the care of my heartless strap
say my name three times like candyman
bet i roll on yo' ass like an avalanche
a sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-by's
murder my foes, can't control my nine
hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
picture me lettin' this chump survive; ran up on his ass
when i dumped he died, 'cause i'm troublesome

la la la la, la, la
la, la-la la, lahhh
bye bye, bye bye
all you niggas die

<i>[twopac:]</i>
young, strapped, and i don't give a fuck â i'm hopeless
i live the thug life, losin' my focus, ba-baby
i'm troublesome, haha
bad boy killa, there is no one realer
what you saw was the rough, rugged and raw â outlaw!

"murder murder" my mind state, shit ain't changed
since my last rhyme â the crime rate ain't decline
niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
like twenty-five to life never crossed they mind
tell me young nigga never learned a thang
dead at thirteen 'cause he yearned to bang
sent a lot of flowers, but how could i cry
tried to warn the little nigga, "either stop or die"
mercy is for the weak, when i speak i scream
afraid to sleep; i'm having crazy dreams
vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
god to forgive me 'cause it's wrong, but i plan to die
either take me in heaven and understand i was a sheep
did the best i could, raised in insanity
or send me to hell, 'cause i ain't begging for my life
ain't nothing worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
i'm troublesome

la la la la, la, la
la, la-la la, lahhh
bye bye, bye bye
all you niggas die

in your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
hahahaha â i'm troublesome, i don't give a fuck
i'm troublesomeâ¦ like my nigga napoleon said, nigga
somebody gotta explain why i ain't got shit
ha ha, i'm troublesome
you know what time it is, the outlaw clique

kadafi, kastro, napoleon, po-nitty
haha, we ain't fuckin' around

ayo, haha, we troublesome, i ain't going, ha hah
young kastro, the first to blast, the last one to dash
going for the hoes and the cash

but they can't mock you, nigga, you're too strong
outlawz keep it going on, you know whassup

outlawz, outlawz
this is dedicated to the real niggas
all the real troublesome soldiers on the streets

â¦bye bye, bye bye, all you niggas dieâ¦


<i>[twopac:]</i>
i see no changes, wake up in the morning and i ask myself:
"is life worth living? should i blast myself?"
i'm tired of being poor and, even worse, i'm black
my stomach hurts so i'm looking for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a negro
pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
"give the crack to the kids: who the hell cares?
one less hungry mouth on the welfare!"
first ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
"it's time to fight back," that's what huey said
two shots in the dark, now huey's dead
i got love for my brother
but we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
we gotta start making changes
learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
and that's how it's supposed to be
how can the devil take a brother if he's close to me?
i'd love to go back to when we played as kids
but things change... and that's the way it is

<i>[talent:]</i>
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is
aww yeah
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is
aww yeah

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i see no changes, all i see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
we under, i wonder what it takes to make this
one better place, let's erase the wasted
take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
'cause both black and white are smoking crack tonight
and the only time we chill is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
and although it seems heaven-sent
we ain't ready to see a black president
it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact:
the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
but some things will never change
try to show another way, but you staying in the dope game
now tell me, what's a mother to do?
being real don't appeal to the brother in you
you gotta operate the easy way
"i made a g today," but you made it in a sleazy way
selling crack to the kids
"i gotta get paid!", well hey, but that's the way it is

<i>[talent:]</i>
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is
aww yeah
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is
aww yeah

<i>[twopac talking:]</i>
we gotta make a change
it's time for us as a people to start making some changes
let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
and let's change the way we treat each other
you see the old way wasn't working
so it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

<i>[twopac:]</i>
and still i see no changes
can't a brother get a little peace?
it's war on the streets and a war in the middle east
instead of war on poverty
they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
and i ain't never did a crime i ain't have to do
but now i'm back with the facts giving it back to you
don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
crack you up and pimp-smack you up
you gotta learn to hold your own
they get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
but tell the cops they can't touch this
i don't trust this, when they try to rush i bust this
that's the sound of my tool
you say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
and as long as i stay black, i gotta stay strapped
and i never get to lay back
'cause i always got to worry 'bout the payback
some buck that i roughed up way back
coming back after all these years
"rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat!" that's the way it is

<i>[talent:]</i>
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is
aww yeah
(you're my brother, you're my sister)
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is
aww yeah

<i>[twopac:]</i>
some things'll never change


<i>[twopac:]</i>
how long will they mourn me?
yeah, this for my nigga kato
it's still on, nigga, believe that!
we live a thug life, thugs for life, ha ha
(how long will they mourn me?)
we handle this shit for you, boy
yeah, nigga, twopac in this motherfucker

<i>[twopac:]</i>
all my homies drinkin' liquor, tears in everybody's eyes
niggas cried to mourn a homie's homicide
but i can't cry, instead i'm just a shoulder
damn, why they take another soldier?
i load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
i'll get them suckers back before you're buried
retaliate and pull a one-eight-seven
do real niggas get to go to heaven ?
how long will they mourn me? bury me a motherfuckin' g
bitch, don't wanna die, then don't fuck with me
it's kinda hard to be optimistic 
when your homie's lyin' dead on the pavement twisted
y'all don't hear me though, i'm tryin' hard to make amends
but i'm losin' all my motherfuckin' friends
damn! they should've shot me when i was born
now i'm trapped in the motherfuckin' storm
how long will they mourn me?

<i>[nate dogg (twopac):]</i>
i wish it would have been another

how long will they mourn my brother?

i wish it would have been another
(dedicated this to kato, nigga, and e'ry thug)
(how long will they mourn me?)
how long will they mourn my brother?
(yo, nigga, we gotta keep this shit goin' on; yo, syke!)

<i>[big syke:]</i>
how long will they mourn me? every motherfuckin' day, homie
you stayed down when the other niggas didn't know me
from my heart to the trigger you my fuckin' nigga
and things won't be the same without you, nigga
i remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'lac
and goin' half on a motherfuckin' hundred sack
smokin' blunt after blunt, and steady drinkin'
hung around so much, you knew what i was thinkin'
tell me, lord, why you take big kato?
so confused not knowin' which way to go
i'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
i can't take it, i'm losin' my fuckin' mind
so day after day, ride after ride
we'll hook up on the other side
watch over your family and your newborn
'til we meet again, homie â how long will they mourn me?

<i>[nate dogg (big syke):]</i>
i wish it would have been another. big kato.
(how long will they mourn me? it's still on, nigga)
how long will they mourn my brother?
(how long will they mourn me?)
i wish it would have been another
(how long will they mourn me?)
how long will they mourn my brother?
(rated r, double jeopardy, mac ten)

<i>[the rated r (double jeopardy):]</i>
damn, a nigga tired of feelin' sad, i'm tired of puttin' in work
i'm tired of cryin', watchin' my homies leave the earth
i know soon one day i'll be in the dirt
and my peoples'll be mournin'
when they get a call from the coroner
all niggas can say is, "that's fucked up."
and get tossed up, reminiscin' how we grew up
rest and love to my nigga kato
see you in the crossroads real soon
for now, let me pour out some brew
i'll be always thinkin' of you, homie
rest in peace â how long will they mourn me?

<i>[macadoshis (mac ten):]</i>
we know life's a fuckin' trip, and everybody gotta go
but why the fuck it have to be my nigga kato?
another nigga fell victim to the chrome
it's enough to make you crazy, it's fuckin' with my dome
you only live once on this earth
a nigga had it bad since the day of my motherfuckin' birth
but niggas say they down and they always be my homie
but when a nigga gone, how long will you mourn me?

<i>[nate dogg (twopac):]</i>
i wish it would have been another
(mac ten in this motherfucker, yeah!)
(how long will you mourn me?!)
how long will they mourn my brother?
(thug life, boy, nate, blowin' that shit)
i wish it would have been another
(nate dogg, do that shit, nigga, yeah)
(how long will you mourn me?!)
how long will they mourn my brother?
(this for my nigga kato, and all his kids)
(how long will you mourn me?!)
i wish it would have been another
how long will they mourn my brother?


<i>[e.d.i. (twopac):]</i>
uh, dear mr. president. what's happenin'?
i'm writin' you because
shit is still real fucked up in my neighborhood
pretty much the same way
right around the time when you got electedâ¦
ain't nothin' changed. all the promises you made, before you got electedâ¦ they ain't came true
(tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up in the hood)
(send mo' troops, dear mr. president)
me and my homies is wonderin' what's goin' onâ¦ holla!
(tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up in the hood)
(send mo' troopsâ¦)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
why should i lie when i can dramatize?
niggas fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
simply by spittin' i've been blessed given riches
enemies suspicious cuz i'm seldom in the company of bitches
plus the concepts i depict so visual that you can kiss
each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit i kick
my heaviest verse'll move a mountain
casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
fuck the friendships, i ride alone
destination: death row â finally found a home
plus all my homies wanna die; call it euthanasia
dear lord, look how sick this ghetto made us
sincerely yours, i'm a thug, the product of a broken home
everybody's doped up, nigga, what you smokin' on?
figure if we high they can train us
but then america fucked up and blamed us
i guess it's cause we black that we targets
my only fear is god, i spit that hard shit
in case you don't know i let my pump go
get it ride for mutulu like i ride for geronimo
down to die for everything i represent
meant every word in my letter to the president

<i>[twopac:]</i>
dear mr. president, tell me what to do
these niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
dear mr. president, tell me what to do
these niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops

<i>[e.d.i. amin:]</i>
oh you's a baller in the white house, i hope you comfortable
cause yo', i spend my nights out, with the lights out
under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
and young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
<i>[?]</i>, leave a nigga flat for scratch
the godless, i gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
wanna ban rap? - stand back, before you get hurt
it's the only thing nigga pay the paper besides smoke and work
on a mission, listen <i>[?]</i> with precision
first made my decision, i realized this ain't livin'
trippin' to drastic measures, tryin' to get stacks of cheddar
motherfuckers hate cops, wait, it ain't gettin' better
but you keep tellin' us that it is
while your motherfuckin' troops keep killin' our kids
dig, don't be surprised if you see us
dumpin' with nothing but artillery to free us, motherfucker

<i>[e.d.i. amin:]</i>
dear mr. president, tell us what to do
these niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
dear mr. president, tell me what to do
these niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops

<i>[kastro:]</i>
strapped and angry, with no hope, and heart-broke
fightin' first my trained brain until it's not so
it's hostile, niggas lick shots to watch the glocks glow
cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
and it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
to people beefin' and things squeakin' on they beefs for weeks
mr. president, it's evident, nobody really care
for a struggler out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
i was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
so i'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
but y'all play fair, give me and mine, i'll share
'til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
me and these two hundred and twenty-three's will freeze the biggest with ease
i'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
and i've been born to represent, for that i've been heaven-sent
and i meant every word in my letter to the president

<i>[e.d.i. mean:]</i>
shit is still fucked up, y'all. and y'all wonder when it's gon' get better, and it ain't gon' get better

<i>[twopac:]</i>
dear mr. president, tell me what to do
these niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
dear mr. president, tell me what to do
these niggas actin' upâ¦

<i>[twopac:]</i>
heavenly father, may i holla at you briefly?
i wanna meet the president, but will he meet me?
is he scared to look inside the eyes of a thug nigga?
we tired of being scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
how hypocritical is liberty?
that blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
my history full of casket and scars
my own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
and they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin' hard
sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was god?
somewhere in the middle of my mind
is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin', "let him die!"
can't lie, i'm a thug, drownin' in my own blood
lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
down to die for everything i represent
meant every word in my letter to the president

<i>[big syke:]</i>
blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin' low?
y'all sniffin' blow and postin' what they hittin' fo'?
tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
look what you made, little kids gettin' sprayed
day after day, and night after night
battles and wars to the daylight
we might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
'til then we gonna keep it comin', mr. president
and i meant every word in my letter to the president

<i>[twopac:]</i>
word motherfuckin' life, what the fuck this nigga think?
cuttin' taxes, takin' off welfare
we 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin'?!
motherfuckers crazier than a motherfuckin' scout
nigga, this thug life, westside, outlaw immortalz
nigga, we finna hustle 'til we come up

<i>[twopac:]</i>

i know you fear me cause you too near me not to hear me
so why don't you help a nigga out? (send mo' troops)
sayin' you cuttin' welfare

police beatin' me in the streetsâ¦ fuck peace!
these niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops..troops..troops..troops!


<i>[kastro]</i>
dear lord, as we down here, struggle for as long as we know
in search of a paradise to touch (my nigga johnny j)
dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go, the only place for us
i know, try to make the best of bad situations
seems to be my life's story
ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
and can't nobody live this life for me
it's a ride y'all, a long hard ride

<i>[twopac]</i>
somebody wake me, i'm dreamin'
i started as a seed, the semen
swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'
on the top was my pops, my mama screamin' stop
from a single drop, this is what they got
not to disrespect my peoples, but my papa was a loser
only plan he had for mama was to fuck her and abuse her
even as a little seed, i could see his plan for me
stranded on welfare, another broken family
now what was i to be? a product of this heated passion
mama got pregnant and papa got a piece of ass
look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
how can i survive? got me askin' white jesus
"will a nigga live or die?" cause the lord can't see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
no sunny days and we only play sometimes
when everybody's sleepin'
i open my window, jump to the streets and get to creepin'
i can live or die, hope i get some money 'fore i'm gone
i'm only nineteen, i'm tryna hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryna slang rocks
i'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
you can buy rocks, glocks or a herringbone
you can ask my man, he's a mind reader
keep my nine heater all the time, this is how we grind
meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out
pass the weed, nigga! that hennessey'll keep me keyed, nigga
everywhere i go niggas holla at me, "keep it real, g"
and my reply 'til they kill me: "act up if you feel me!"
i was born not to make it, but i did
the tribulations of a ghetto kid, still i rise

<i>[ta'he]</i>
still i (still i), i rise (i rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky)
and if (and if), i die (i die), i don't want you to cry

<i>[yaki kadafi]</i>
i stay sharp as always
runnin' your bricks with blitz, through your project hallways
dumpin' crews like two's, nigga, all day
secrets of war prepare me for the worst
a life that's lavish, full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
but now my dreams, it seems though
be placin' triple beams and things, bro
diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans

<i>[napoleon]</i>
now i plan to keep my glock cocked
if trouble was searchin' for me, then why not?
show 'em what i'm made of, plus raised on, on my block
chancellor ave, where many turn to the street
thugs snatchin' bags, we out for power, makin' cash
it wasn't fast, it'll make me mad, i'm just like him
my homie on the corner with his gat tucked in
youngins, they buckin' somethin'
the life he lead's the life he don't need, don't we all know?
he tryin' to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise

<i>[young noble]</i>
dreams of lost hope
i hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
and still i rise, now i float, cowards ghost
whenever we come around, i'm runnin' down
clutchin' a pound, live as sirens, duckin' the sound
i used to hustle with my moms 'til the sun came
my homie harm doin' time from this drug game
stolen cars, war scars, born a outlaw
behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
crackheads only ten learn to duck cops

<i>[yaki kadafi]</i>
in 'ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blastin' bastards
no faces for open caskets, peelin' your cap backwards
you cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
i send my missiles through your mattress
leavin' holes in your body like a cactus
while me and my crew be boppin' more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin'
leavin' your spleen to pick up
half of you niggas is softer than a snicker
let's go to war and see who draw quicker
and still i rise, and still i riseâ¦

<i>[ta'he]</i>
still i (still i), i rise (i rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky)
and if (and if), i die (i die), i don't want you to cry
still i (still i), i rise (i rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky)
and if (and if), i die (i die), i don't want you to cry

c'mon pops, let's go!

you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
it's as simple as that for me and my niggas

<i>[e.d.i. amin:]</i>
war time, war time, it's either yours or mine
outlawz be on the grind and a mission to shine
and ride on 'em, leave 'em stuck and fucked from the gate
set it straight, regulate, with a bomb i'm about to detonate
boom! hesitate? aww, now you know what
ya'll niggas were here to go if you know it was good for ya
bunch of toy soldiers all dressed in fatigue
but i'm e.d.i. amin on a mission to make 'em bleed
nigga what? nigga who? it was cool? and at you?
what the fuck is you gonna do? barbecue and boo-hoo
ride or die, get money, all at the same time
split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
any nigga slippin', fall at the same time
we all links in the chain, tryin' to gain, do time
we all see the sunshine, but when you could do yours
we'll bring these motherfuckers war

<i>[twopac:]</i>
as i approach the scene
from smokin' green got my eyes closed
niggas so cold on my foes, i make 'em die froze
watch me make 'em bleed, makin' g's, lord, help me with it
got me paintin' pictures of a meal ticket, help me get it
see me and pray for options, but the pressures nonstop
niggas get the pistol poppin' and watch his body drop
i'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set, flash on
blast on them bitch-made niggas with my mask on
do it for profit, plus i'm lookin' for punks to bust on
if you ain't screamin' "westside!" you can get the fuck on
i'm seein' demons, hittin' weed, got me hearin' screamin'
scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope fiend
probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
i live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
niggas pass the clip and watch me bring 'em to the floor
got some shit that they ain't ready for: i got the secrets of war

<i>[e.d.i. amin:]</i>
you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
see it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
look it's as simple as that for me and my niggas

<i>[yaki kadafi:]</i>
we do this thug life shit, like four, five, six, stick 'em
down with no rounds left up in the pound when the sounds
squeeze the lead off, i blow his motherfuckin' head off
signal all the other outlawz to get this shit set off
yaki kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
these streets is black hockey and raw, we get sloppy
put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar, locked in the slammer, while i'm laid cocked back like a hammer
ya'll newly weds that in honey moons, times 'bout up, y'all
that means i leave no trace found with you face, bounce stuck
your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gon' do?

<i>[e.d.i. amin:]</i>
you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us

check the murder rate percentage, niggas is finished
get blood checks from clinics, this thug shit is in us
flowin' through my system, you a victim
blunts, i twist 'em. fuck the whole world, it's us against them
you got some heat? pull it out, cock the hammer if you with it
don't make no difference here with the twenty-five-to-life sentence
we already doin' life on the streets
like al g., niggas be heated when they walkin' the beat
this shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggas hate me
scared to face me, knowin' that the outlawz blaze me
pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle
once i suck my money muscle, all the g's got devils
movin' shit like a dollar, beatin' niggas like rodney
turn a killer like kadafi, and a nuke stream to stop me

<i>[e.d.i. amin:]</i>

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now here's a story 'bout a woman with dreams
so picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
i could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me
"what would you do if it was you?"

couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
i tried to trade places in the tragedy
i couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin' me
for just a moment i was trapped in the pain
lord, come and take me
four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me
even though it wasn't me, i could feel the grief
thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
no! you got to find a way to survive
'cause they win when your soul dies

<i>[twopac (h.e.a.t.):]</i>
baby please don't cry! you got to keep your head up
even when the road is hard, never give up!
baby don't cry! you got to keep your head up

i ain't no hater but that nigga lost in the game
after the bright lights and big thangs
he probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle
everyday, his mind on gettin' mo'
and never your feelings, he's chasin' millions for sho'
uh oh, now you 'bout to have his baby?
another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy
you got too much mo' livin' to do â i'm spittin' this to you
'cause you deserve more than what he givin' to you
beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
a new millennium dime piece, so fine she
got 'em all stuck standin' still when she come through
baby, take a little mo' time, love'll find you
and sho' as the sky's blue somebody other than me
gon' give you everythin' you need, feel me? (don't cry-ahâ¦)

i'm tryin' to do all that i can
from jump, now you losin', you was choosin' the wrong man
dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
lost and turned out, what you let that nigga do to you?
i knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
we was kids, now she got three kids
they see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
seen him last night, homie roll a e-class
mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
i bring her pampers and food, just to stop through
but those ain't my seeds, nothin' really i could do
i feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
should've chose me, she 'bout to od from the pressure
hell nah, i won't let her (baby..)

you probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
and still stranded. merciless thieves stole the best of me
i pray to black jesus to please take the rest of me
and still, the best of us build and reach monetary gains
some of us kill, but still, most of us can change 
if we search deeper
god bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
enemies get beside me, flows go deep as poseidon
when we ride, plots keep all my enemies blinded
time will soon show, a thought can last for years
outshinin' your fake smiles, plastic tears
like last year, niggas stuck in the past, and it's clear
just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year
makaveli for the mob, m.o.b

though times is hard, up against all odds, i play my cards 
like i'm jailin', shots hittin' up my spot like midnight rains hailin'
got me bailin' to stash more greengods; they ain't tryin' to be trapped
on no block slangin' no rocks like bean pies
brainstorm on the beginnin'
wonder how shit like the qu'ran and the bible was written
what is religion?
god's words or a curse like crack?
shai-tan's way of gettin' us back
or just another one of my black jesus' traps

<i>[storm:]</i>
who's got the heart to stand beside me?
i feel my enemies creepin' up in silence
dark prayer, scream violence - demons all around me
can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; black jesus
give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
cause i swear, they tryin' to break my well
i'm on the edge lookin' down at this volatile pit
will it matter if i cease to exist? black jesus

<i>[twopac:]</i>
all hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
submissive souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
in times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
black jesus
he's like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
black jesus

<i>[young noble:]</i>
outlawz we got our own race, culture, religion
rebellin' against the system, commence to lynchin'
the president ain't even listenin' to the pain of the youth
we make music for eternity, forever the truth
political prisoner, the two choices that they givin' us
ride or die, for life they sentence us
oh black jesus, please watch over my brother shawn
soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm
brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
history repeats itself, nuttin new
in school i knew, e'rything i read wasn't true
black jesus

<i>[twopac:]</i>
to this click i'm dedicated, criminal orientated
an outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
made for terror, major league niggas pray together
bitches in they grave while my real niggas play together
we die clutchin' glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
cremated, last wishes niggas smoke my ashes
high sigh why die wishin', hopin' for possibilities
i'll mob on, while they copy me sloppily
cops patrol projects, hatin' the people livin' in them
i was born an inmate, waitin' to escape the prison
went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
god gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
blast 'til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
bitches freeze facin' black jesus

some say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail
and it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell
trapped, black, scarred and barred
searchin' for truth, where it's hard to find god
i play the pied piper, and to this thug life, i'm a lifer
proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
my black jesus, walk through this valley with me
where we, so used to hard times and casualties
indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
and haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
and all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums
this ain't livin'... jesus

<i>[kastro:]</i>
searchin' for black jesus
it's hard, it's hard
we need help out here
so we searchin' for black jesus
it's like a saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through
somebody that understand our pain
you know maybe not too perfect, you know
somebody that hurt like we hurt
somebody that smoke like we smoke
drink like we drink
that understand where we comin' from
that's who we pray to
we need help y'all

nigga, it's a god damn shame, somebody explain
why they sent a bad boy to play a grown man's game?
tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
woke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket
how long will it last? nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast
outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash
my shit's classic, like my nigga nate
go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
niggas aimin' at my head, but i still wear my vest

(hey, tell 'em the story how you came up, nigga)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now, i was born alone, took my first joint and i got high alone

one nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
my nigga edi had a son, we all happy
cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
my niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride
to rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die
been tryin' to make a million by hustlin since my adolescence
from crack dealin' to rap villain, my new profession
who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck threed
you coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
niggas fiendin', i got 'em comin' back. until i die, they label me as a ridah forever, my niggas be together

increase the doses, bust on whoever closest
thug livin', hell of prison, never losin' my focus
i'm makin' money moves mandatory, end of discussion
my past records tell a story, picture niggas with rushin'
and still bustin', 'til the cops come runnin', duck in abandoned buildings
ditchin' my gun, homeboy the motherfuckin' villain
i live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legitly
so i laugh til i'm cryin', when the lord come get me
no baby momma drama, nigga missed me
why plant seeds in a dirty bitch waitin' to trick me
not the life for me, livin' carefree 'til i'm buried
and if they dare me, i'll bust on them niggas, and until they scurry
i'm clearly a man of military means, to my artillery
watchin' over me through every murder scene
from adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
sellin' dope to all the fiends, at times i wanna cry
and still, we try to change the past in vain
never knowin' if this game will last, feelin' the shame
of cocaine, the product of the devil, am i sellin' my soul
got tired of small time livin' nigga tellin' me no
i got mine, fuck them other suckas
that's the mentality, jealous ass bustas make it hell for a hustler

niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
and if the cops come arrest me in the evening
best believe they comin' for my dogs in the morning
and if i die by a slug, the death of a true thug
tell me will my niggas mourn me? gettin' blowed out
high watch me murder the bird before he testify
strikes walkin' close to my third, i live a troubled life
and if you dream, be a part of my team from long beach to queens
drug dealers to ex-fiends
keep yo eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustas
either heaven or jail, it's still hell for a hustler

when i bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly
harm me, my army
niggas decease swiftly
look at you now, why you wanna act out?
i pull the hammer back
strike wit' a cannon that'll blow yo muthafuckin' back out
they blast but i'm still standin'
slightly scarred
deep questions for the lord "why he don't like me, god?"
so, though my life was hard with no remorse
i absorb all lessons, provide protection for the boss
rollin' in my double r, rugged and ruthless
keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
and my crew, we crooked, be mistaken for jewels
we all about our cash, blast if you break the rules
fools turned snitch for the d.a., be heaven-sent
switched like a stone-bitch, turned state's evidence, why?
then they wonder why niggas die
put your family in danger, just to get high
now, what the hell can we get from jail?
more tricks for the crime trade, this is hell
bail out, a thug nigga fresh out the jailhouse
open your safe count and take all the mail out
whatever happens happens
whoever falls dies

burnin' churches, fearin' god, who can be so cruel
we all ignorant to aids 'til it happens to you
just be a man, make plans, listen to your voice
a woman's tryin' to make decisions, we should leave them a choice
cause who we to say who lives and die, breathes and stops
all this judgement on other lives needs to stop
what are we livin' for, givin' more back than takin'
on my knees still waitin' for my own salvation
now i feel abandoned cause pat buchanan say i'm greedy
you can take my taxes, send me to war but can't feed me
it's so easy to regret thangs after they done
babies catchin' murder cases scared to laugh in the sun
the tragedies that we all need, love in doses
in times like these we feel closest the good die young

pressures and three strikes, i hope they don't test us
they pull the heat out, ammunition in crates
psssh! move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
they got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
itâs like iâm - dreamin', seein' scenes of me ballin'
participated in felonious behavior
cock the cocked forty-five, snatchin' niggas pagers
labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
we started out drinkin' forty's, moved to harder shit
god damn, now i'm a grown man, i follow no man
nigga got my own plan, and it's called killuminati

toppin' grams on the kitchen plate
tryin' to keep that money straight
times is rolling three up these streets sleep
but when i crack, hammer cocked back, rapped in my sheets
my life's been crossed, crooked since a seed
it hurts, got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
preoccupied by the greed in this crooked life i lead
more funds to spend or bigger guns to squeeze
me and my thugs clock g's, sippin' naughty thangs
real as these tats on my body, and it's killuminati

<i>[twopac (outlawz):]</i>
(yeah, it took a week to go down)
you recollects and see how crazy it sounds
the whole town's on a mission, adolescents (penitentiary bound)
(now introducin' young trigga)
since birth, eyes set on gettin' bigger
just another wild-ass nigga
(but he was fiendin' for precious) what?
(but precious was a ghetto girl)
couldn't be no sex without that gold lexus
(but lil' trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers)
seein' visions of people smokin' and niggas catchin' vapors
got his man from around the corner (we call him lil' mo)
(been in so many reform schools they had to let him go)
(here's where the plot thickens)
they got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin'
(they call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin')
(somebody's gonna die tonight)
still no one's knowin' so they kept goin'
catchin' dealers comin' out they cars
(will they survive? two semi-automatic nine's)
(them niggas died)
(plus nobody in the hood cries)
(it's like they celebrate to death and wish they could die)
so peep the lesson, but wait a minute, back to precious
she's snortin' dope in the back seat of trigg's lexus
teardrops and closed caskets

<i>[nate dogg (twopac w/ outlawz):]</i>

(don't let these ghetto streets get you), precious
(was the victim, from a dime to a nickel)
hopping god's blessings stick with ya
picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin' bigger
familiar face, but a man now, it's lil' trigga
now lil' mo was a soldier to the fullest
down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
(all he wanted was to be a thug)
(never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love)
(here's where it gets ya)
now precious is pregnant, lil' trigga is happy
he wants to marry her now (not knowin' he ain't the daddy)
but precious was lonely, while lil' trigga was makin' dough
(she's slippin' in secret places and gettin' with lil' mo)
the neighborhood's buzzin', now people are talkin'
lil' trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'
(hand in hand, couldn't understand)
how his baby's mama could disappear with another man (and his best friend)
now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
there ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'
just the smoke from the cap peelin', a man with no feelings
(teardrops and closed caskets)

<i>[nate dogg (twopac w/ outlawz):]</i>

now with the problems of poverty and the tricks to these tales
how many people'll die? how many'll live to tell?
although best friends before, lil' trigga and mo
they in an all out war, over a fiend they ain't know
behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
the results is the same with different names and it turns out

<i>[twopac:]</i>
y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
lil' trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick
now he's played out

<i>[twopac (outlawz):]</i>
think it's lil' mo (was plottin' plans on gettin' bigger)
(precious was his way to put his hands on lil' trigga)
all the while let's look at precious, too dumb to see what's goin' down (too doped up to ask questions)
used to be comrades (but now we blast on sight)
what could be so bad? (god, will we last tonight?)
from misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin' ki's
i can't believe the shit they tellin' me
they opened fire, three bodies dropped, so call the cops

my enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through
but that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll 
never be peace long as there's fiends on these cali streets
even on the other side brothers die, but ride
niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
i live my life to fucking mo', expound tragically
how can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
i know i'm probably hellbound, but we got to eat
i'm seeing satin infiltrating; my military mind 
make me hustle all the time, go out for cash making
forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through

made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
answers to the questions, bullets to my smith n' wesson
still stucked up in a fuck session, jersey where the niggas flexing
po-po's guessing if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
wet em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye

visions of killers en masse at the blast mayne

knowing now it's hard to slow down for a addict
it's been years of struggling, guzzling beers
beefin and never even, ain't no love in the air
and i suffer my shit in hell, talking to the heavens
walking through the valley of death with my fellas
i lost a lot, starting with hope i tried
and for every tattoo i got a moment i cried
i'm through with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain
step in my shoes, nuttin to lose, but my brain

ain't nothing to fear, crying these tattooed tears

this is the ballad of a dead soldier
come play the ballad of a dead soldier

the plan, to take command of the whole family
though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
all my road dogs, official mob figures
love to act up, the first to bomb when we rob niggas
i can be lost in my own mind
to be the boss, only thought's: grip on chrome nine's
niggas get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
swore i saw the devil in my empty glass of hennessy
talkin' to a nigga on a tight leash
screamin' "fuck the police!" as i ride through the night streets
little child runnin' wild, towards danger
what's the cause? don't be alarmed, death to all strangers
maybe i'm a madman
a pistol grabbin' nigga, unleash the sandman
promise a merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder
close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier

<i>[singing + twopac:]</i>
thug for life, i will be
this is the ballad of a dead soldier
a life of crime i will lead
close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
if you play the game, you play to win
this is the ballad of a dead soldier
it's a crazy world full of sin
close your eyesâ¦

completely lost, revenge at all costs
payback's a bitch, switched, now the trick's crossed
tossed up and never to be heard of
a single witness screamin', "bloody murder, murder!"
blast, tell me, homie, what you see now?
a blind man and a dead body, i'm ready to leave town
and get my cash though, hook up with kastro
homie had to blast on the task force
stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
they took my money and my stash; time to get 'em back
upon my secret arrival
two glock four-fives, time for survival
death to my rivals, tell me, what you want, lord?
nobody left after the death of a drug lord
the situation's critical
nothing is colder, than hear the ballad of a dead soldier

<i>[singing + twopac:]</i>
thug for life, i will be

close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier

be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
when my glocks rang out, the niggas came out, boom!
who wanna see me in a challenge?
so merciless, i'm terrifyin' niggas in my ballads
do you feel me? capo or capi-tan
one day i'll be the don; until then, remain strong
my only fear of death is reincarnation
bustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient
to all my niggas facin' sixty years
sheddin' tattooed tears, another suicidal on the tier
takin' private planes, tryin' to survive the game
for all my homies that'll never be alive again
all they promise us is death, nigga
take a breath, come be the last one left, nigga
it's real now, feel it or fantasize it, ain't nuttin colder
listen, you can hear it â the ballad of a dead soldier

<i>[singing + twopac:]</i>
thug for life, i will be
this is the ballad of a dead soldier
a life of crime i will lead
close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
if you play the game, you play to win
this is the ballad of a dead soldier
it's a crazy world full of sin
close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier

this go out to kato, mental, all the niggas that passed away
mutulu, geronimo, seyku â all the down-ass riders
all the niggas that put it down, all the soldiers
all the niggas that go through that day-to-day struggle
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier!)
all the niggas that passed on
all the niggas with ambition and money in they heart
all the niggas that want some and that don't take none
hahaha (it's the ballad of a dead soldier!)
the police are so scared of us
all the feds they aware of us
they wanna see us dead
they got pictures of a nigga head, (ballad of a dead soldier!)
tryin' to see me in chains, shit
them niggas'll never breathe again
before they put me in a cell, they'll see me in hell
('cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!)
got my pistols cocked
run the whole motherfuckin' block; fuck the cops!
the police? we run these streets, nigga
(ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!)
these niggas can't see me, half the world wanna be me
multi-millionaire; shit, it ain't fair
but nigga, you know â it's the ballad of a dead soldier!

i can't stand no sneaker-wearin' nappy head bitch

puttin' bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief

was it prophecy? clear as day, visions on top of me
erotic, psychotic, would possess bubonics
far from a crush, i wanna bust your guts and touch
everything inside you from my head to my nuts
you got me sweatin' like a fat girl goin' for mine
just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind
back in time, i recall how she used to be
i guess money and fame made you used to me

you probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
made a livin' out of cuss words, liquor and weed
a bad seed turned good, in this world of g's
baby got me fantasizin' seein' you naked

i was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
fiendin' for wicked adventures, ambitious as i was
picture a nigga on the verge of livin' insane
i sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
now tell if i'm wrong
but sayin' "fuck the world" got you deeper in my songs
drinkin' 'til i earl, spendin' money 'til it's gone
it's the good life - maybe niggas got it goin' on
now maybe if i died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
bad boy niggas eat a dick a day, bumpin' this
lord have mercy it's a slaughter
so wicked that my tracks is wettin' niggas like it's water
i learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
but i'm a baller now, nigga, i live the good life

haha, listen closely
they say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
my after time is narrow, peepin' down the barrel of a foe
just a nigga or a killer i don't know so
who makes the call will i fall a victim like the rest?
slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure i'm gone
send me home all alone in these cold streets
in desperation constantly drinkin' and i can't sleep
neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
some wanna die i wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
let me modify this whole region
i declare this sucker duckin' season, give me the reason
why i should change, into a softie
.. after livin' so loftily
it cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world
me, my niggas, and my girl - livin' the good life!

gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
clearly over the edge, soon as i wake up
last night we off the hook, doin' way too much
but it's the fast lane only, big dealin' big ceilin'
all for the money, some kill some squeal
all for the money, most ain't even real
but we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
i watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin'
bitch nigga get to runnin' 'fore my click get to gunnin'
still in the midst of all the stress and pain
we still tryin' to get a hold of the game
livin' that good life

to my unborn childâ¦
to my unborn child
in case i don't make it
just remember, daddy loves you

now ever since my birth
i've been cursed, since i'm born to wile
in case i never get to holla at my unborn child
many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
trying to earn every penny that i'm gettin', i'm reminiscin'
to the beginning of my mission
when i was conceived and came to be in this position
my momma was a panther: loud single parent, but she proud
when she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
went to school, but i dropped out and left the house
'cause my mama say i'm good for nothing, so i'm out
since i only got one life to live, god forgive me for my sins
let me make it and i'll never steal again or deal again
my only friend is my misery
wanting revenge for the agony they did to me
see, my life ain't promised, but it's sure getting better
hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child

<i>[natasha walker:]</i>
i'm writing you a letter
this is to my unborn child
want to let you know i love you
if you didn't know i feel this way
'cause i think about you every day
i have so much to say

seems so complicated to escape fate
and you can never understand till we trade places
tell the world i feel guilty for being anxious
ain't no way in hell that i could ever be a rapist
it's hard to face this cold world on a good day
when will they let the little kids in the hood play?
i got shot five times, but i'm still breathin'
living proof there's a god if you need a reason
can i believe in my own fate?
will i raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?
dear mama, i'm a man now
i wanna make it on my own, not a handout
make way for a whirlwind prophesized
i wanna go in peace when i got to die
on these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
in case you never see my face again, to my unborn child

<i>[natasha walker:]</i>
i'm writing you a letter
this is to my unborn child
want to let you know i love you
if you didn't know i feel this way
'cause i think about you every day
i have so much to say

dear lord, can you hear me? tell me what to say
to my unborn seed in case i pass away
will my child get to feel love?
or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?
'cause being black hurts, and even worse if you speak first
living my life as an outlaw â what could be worse?
'cause maybe if i tried to change
who'm i kidding? i'm a thug 'til i die; i'm a rider, mane
touch bases, eat lunch in plush places
regular criminal oasis awaits us
if there's a ghetto for true thugs, i'll see you there
and i'm sorry for not being there
just know your daddy was a soldier: me against the world
bless the boys and all my little girls
to the lord: i'm eternal, resting in peace
please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child

please take care of all my kids and my unborn child
to my unborn childâ¦
this letter goes out to my seeds that i might not get to see 'cause of this lifestyle
just know your daddy loved you
got nothing but love for you
and all i wanted was for you to have a better life than i had
'cause i was out there on a twenty-four hour three hundred and sixty-five grind
when you get to be my age, you'll understand
just know i got love for you
and i'll see you if there's a ghetto in heaven
if there's a ghetto heaven, i'll be there waiting for you
heh heh, take care. run wild, but be smart
follow the rules of the game
i know sometimes there's confusion
rules of the game is gonna get you through it
all day every day
watch out for these snakes and fakes
friends come a dime a dozen
be an individual, work hard
study, get your mind sharp, trust nobody

let's turn this house into a happy home
you know how that is, stay down for mine
outlaw, look

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now we've been kickin' it for quite some time
remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
we done fought so many times i forgot to count
i never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
remember back in december when we was tight?
sippin' alize and cristal, whylin' every night - in my bedroom!
promised that i commit to you soon
tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
straight out the hood
we promised to be good to each other, plus i love you
so i know you gon' make a good mother
just try to understand if i change in time
it's only 'cause i never owned anything that's mine
so i'm trying you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
never call the police, i never call you bitch or ho'
we were all born hungry in this world alone
finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home

<i>[singer (twopac):]</i>
happy home. 
(let's turn this house into a happy home)
happy home. 
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)
happy home. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
happy home. 

<i>[twopac:]</i>
born through hard times, ghetto child of mine
i wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
to be honest it's a hard road
just keep your faith in god, knowin' you'll get scarred though
look at him walkin' and talkin', a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
made her my wife now, i'm tryin' hard y'all
maybe in time i'll be a better man
watchin' the older couples, handle it like veterans
show me the meanin' of forever and together we rise
if it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
why - question my love, it's so easy to see
without my family all i'm left with is a shadow of me
after all the arguments, and the nights alone
now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home

<i>[singer (twopac):]</i>
happy home. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
happy home. 
(finally got to live the good life inside a happy home)
happy home. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
happy home. 
(happy home)

<i>[singer (twopac):]</i>
all these problems got me going
we got a family, of our own
i just wanna happy home
(turn this house into a happy home)
no man's made to stand alone
i promise i won't do you wrong
i just want a happy home
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)

<i>[singer (twopac):]</i>
happy home.

<i>[kastro (napoleon):]</i>
we goin' all out, we goin' all out
we goin' all out
watch your motherfuckin' mouth, niggas!
(that's right, fuck these fag niggas!)
do it, do it, do it!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
just another lost soul, stuck, callin' jehovah
outlaw 'til it's over, brandish my strap, back like a cobra
i stay drunk, 'cause i'm a mad man whenever sober
on a one-man mission, my ambition's to hold up
the rap game, while i pluck holes in niggas, like donuts
and still down to die for all my soldiers, like hillbillies
they don't fear me, so we feud, bringin' war to the city
with each breath, death before dishonor
never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor
a general in war, i'm the first to bomb
with a squad of trusted killers
quick to move shit heavily armed
i'm similar to saddam, sometimes i question who's sane
like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
i hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
i take the figure of thirty niggas who all got me
while bitches wonderin' who shot me
no love, keep a grudge, shootin' slugs like muammar gaddafi
murder my friends, build a new posse
we takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga, like rocky
you got a lot of nerve to play me
another gay rapper, bustin' caps at jay z
(buck buck buck buck buck!) and still avoid capture
while y'all caught up in the rapture, still after me
i'm in jamaica, sippin' daiquiris, no doubt
we used to havin' nothin'
then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasn't
i can't tour, fear of catchin' cases, litigation
niggas playa-hatin', got me crooked in all fifty states
i'm screamin', "death row!"
throw my westside, ain't no thang
we was raised off drive-bys, brought up to bang
we claim mob, m.o.b., if you be specific
we control all cash from atlantic-pacific
and get this: i'm hard to kill when i peel with this live spot
father, how the hell did i survive these five shots?
live it up or give it up, and like demons
late night, hear them screamin', "we goin' all out!"

<i>[e.d.i.:]</i>
we goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
take them the war route, without a doubt
ball, which means we all ride if it's on
each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
if you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
obstacles in your way, you better go all out

<i>[napoleon:]</i>
i'm on my last leg, walkin' through the belly of the beast
feelin' like i'm all out, drunk as can be
it's plain to see, that we mob niggas hidin' in bushes
claimin' that they ride rough, but they softer than cushion
they softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin' in blood
outlawz, my blood brothers, i'd die for these thugs
say hi to this slug, it's a shame how some niggas on the west coast was ridin' with 'pac, but when he died, they went pop
i'm out in jers, to the fullest, like some west coast love
but after 'pac stopped rappin', it ain't no west coast thug
just west coast slut
to my real niggas stuck in the street game, 'cause rappers like jay z be pumpin' kool-aid through they veins
is it true what i'm sayin'? slap your soft ass to the floor
and watch my fo'-fo' put peek holes through your door
i ride or die, but these other fag niggas be bitin' this
it's all from my heart when i was writin' this; all out!

<i>[e.d.i.:]</i>
we goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
take them the war route, without a doubt
ball, which means we all ride if it's on
each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
if you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
obstacles in your way, you better go all out

<i>[kastro:]</i>
now, we all ride, and down to die; who with us?
speak up, or get treated like you comin' to kill us
they ain't nothin' but squealers
in this rap game, swearin' they rough
tattooed up, and now them niggas swearin' they 'pac
stop that, and watch your back, we ain't forgot 'bout ya
these glocks hot, and when shot, it'll bring the bitch up out ya
it's me, kastro with the goattee
walkin' like a og, 'cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
i pray to thug lords, like them motherfuckers holy
frontline soldier, 'til the heavens call me
i go all out, and if you real, you real
feel what i'm talkin' 'bout, 'cause this game is ill
i live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'til they feel it
livin' proof, pac breed niggas they can't deal with
holla back, right back, and watch your mouth
or get blood in it, what; we goin' all out, nigga!

<i>[e.d.i.:]</i>
we goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out

talkin' slick on all of these motherfuckin' records
and we ain't gon' say shit
now it's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, it's a different grind
don't disrespect the don
it's still war, motherfuckers
so let's see you act like you know


niggas fuckin' with the wrong nigga

my seductive introduction be specific
still elusive, but exclusive's what i give you when i kick it
and i'm still lifted; niggas can't get with mr. wicked
picture me flippin' my adversaries, gettin' the dick swiftly
niggas is swingin' wild, but they styles miss me
you can bring that bitch, but your whole click will still get treated shitty
business never personal
i'm up before the sun come up, i'm tired
just a ghetto star, a drop top double-r is what i'm ridin'
nigga, if you was half the man your bitch was
bring yo' artillery when you come for me, 'cause we sick thugs
no hesitation when i pull and blast, 'cause syke was bustin'
plus, bo had 'em duckin', screamin', "get they cash!"
so now i got the law on me
my phone's tapped so i had to send word through my lil' homies
tell them niggas this the year when they pull the trigger
shit, this is what you get, for fuckin' with the wrong nigga

this is what you get
when you fuckin' with the wrong nigga
hehehehe, yeah, nigga, peep it

before i lay me down to sleep, i pray and thank the lord
for givin' me another fruitful day
i wanna be a peaceful, man, but still when niggas come for me
all i can see is gettin' 'em killed
for real, it's how i feel
reflect my thoughts, flowin' on these reels
make my enemies deal with my steel; they caps peeled
we still cool, but you played yourself
give him the mac and make him spray hisself, hey
fallin' legends clutchin' chrome three-five-seven
puttin' two bullets to they dome, wanted to die in heaven
why call in shots? nobody really as clear as me
ain't tryin' to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
murder, my foes get disposed of
we all homies to the death, so my true niggas show me love
god, forgive me for my lifestyle, a negative figure
but why they fuckin' with the wrong nigga
you know?

it's like, why you fuckin' with the wrong nigga?

i was raised by thugs, schooled by killers
learned my mathematics skills from real drug dealers
tried to rise, but they tried me
i guess they all had to die, 'cause we tried peace
i die in these streets
blast 'til they recognize
still do or die, all my niggas gettin' high, watchin' time fly
best strategize on the way to profit
best organize how you ride, so they can't stop it
then keep it poppin', lot of busters wanna see me fall
i fucked your bitch, and now this new shit, gon', fade 'em all
my niggas ball, made a call for some back-up
for lil' homies and my dogs in the black truck
"buck buck" was the sound as they gats burst
no need for ambulance, baby, bring the black hearse
should've never fucked around, buster
how you figure makin' moves on the wrong nigga

it's what it sounds like, ding ding ding.
when you fuckin' with the wrong nigga
niggas gettin' hit, when they fuckin' with the wrong nigga
fuckin' with the wrong nigga

turn over! maybe it's the thug in me!


<i>[twopac]</i>
imagine if we could go back
actually talk to the motherfuckers that persevered (hehehe)
i mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
(hey, excuse me, excuse me) y'know? (look)

<i>[twopac]</i>
we back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
but let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
pardon, not disregardin' what you thinkin' but you must abandon ship
cause once i rip your whole shit is sinkin'
supreme ideology, you claim to hold
claimin' that we all drug dealers with empty souls
that used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
in the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
shatter, black talon style, thoughts i throw
it remains in your brain then of course it grows
maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
picture a life where black babies can survive past five
but we must have hope, quotin' the reverend from the pulpit
refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
lace me with words of destruction and i'll explode
but supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
this ain't bout talkin' 'bout problems, i bring solutions
where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
you violated, now i'm back to haunt your nights
listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
and in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
we comin' back, for everything you owe

i'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
i'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
armed with missiles guns grenades
pull out the pin, free i'm comin'

<i>[twopac]</i>
how do you plead mr. shakur, how do you plead?
how do i plead?
yes sir, how do you plead?
shit, you know how i plead
c'mon!
psssh

<i>[twopac]</i>
not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin' for ki's
i was home alone, blind to the prelude
bust in, talkin' bout, "where is the quaaludes?" what you say fool?
where in the hell is the search warrant?
no feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed "nigga motherfucker"
dropped me to my knees, i proceed to bleed
sufferin' a rain of blows to my hands and knees
will i survive, is god watchin'?
i grab his gat and bust in self-defense, my only option
god damn!
now they got me goin' to the county jail
and my family can't pay this outrageous bail
try to offer me a deal, they told me if i squeal
move me, and my people, to a mansion in brazil
not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
i'll be stressed and they just, repossessed my benz
told the judge it was self-defense, he won't listen
so i'm bumpin' this in federal prison, givin' everything i owe

i'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
i'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
armed with missiles guns grenades
pull out the pin, free i'm comin'
i'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
i'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
armed with missiles guns grenades
pull out the pin, free i'm comin'


<i>[twopac (hussein fatal):]</i>

mobb six feet deep, you try to bust me 'til death
and i suppose you got the dopest moves like chucky on fresh
you know the verdict, who what when why he died murdered
get your physical diverted and your vision deserted

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now ever since momma got fucked and papa ducked out
look at us, murderous thugs showin' less love in the drug house
similar to savages, it's a wonder we manage
bring chaos causin' damage on our quest for cabbage
they ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
most wanted by the population murdered you for it
exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
criminal orders across the waters bringin' the war to the streets
why fear me, fear the shit i speak
once this shit drop it's heard on every fuckin' street
like the sound of police
who run the streets really?
in every hood legends grow
from the hustlaz up at harlem to shot callers in o'
and though, congress, don't want us to progress, we strapped
my homie buried at an early age hustled to death
his last breath, a lesson i possess like jewels
stay thugged out keep it movin'

hey where that nigga

<i>[yaki kadafi:]</i>
halfway thugs don't budge when we stalk the streets
sort of like <i>[?]</i> and narcotics when they walk the beat
you speak the beef pussy draw down and drop it
hit you with six shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
gettin' mines with nine cocked extortin'
blocks pop with twenty-two's in my socks with the butt hangin' out the chocolate
you never seen time i travel across dream crime

with my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin'
catch my body like haitian five minutes from the station

<i>[young noble:]</i>
hit the hole like allen iverson with confidence

they know they was fuckin' with me but they dumb to see

<i>[twopac:]</i>
open up fire watch 'em expire when my shells split 'em
plus all them trick niggas basically can go to hell with 'em
fuck 'em they phony claimin' they homies but they foes
speakin' on thug niggas daily, while we nailin' they hoes
explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
words are known to spray blaze as i raise my thug nation
a crooked thought, cops get bought, no longer caught
out on bail, raised in hell, nigga fuck what you thought
did you cry when my girl died?
put out the hit, politic niggas worldwide, grabbin' my dick
iâll never learn, take away the pain with sherm
throwin' gas on my enemies watchin' 'em burn
kamikaze, iâm shootin' up the casket take the body
whip the corpse like a piã±ata and party
his last breath, a straight lesson i possess like jewels
stay thugged out keep it movin'
runnin' on e.
stay thugged out keep it movin'
runnin' on e

<i>[twopac talking:]</i>
one time, one time for the niggas that stayed down for us
runnin' on e
smif-n-wessun the cocoa brovaz, buckshot, bdi, runnin' on e
the bootcamp click
what happened, that was it?


<i>[twopac:]</i>
perhaps i was addicted to the dark side
somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
and even though we both came from the same places
the money and the fame made us all change places
how could it be? through the misery that came to pass
the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
for currency, but you could run to me when you need
and i'll never leave, honestly
someone to believe in, as you can see
it's a small thing to a true, what could i do?
real homies help you get through
and come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
'cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
and half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
it never stops, when my mama ask me will i change
i tell her "yeah," but it's clear
i'll always be the same; until the end of time

<i>[r.l. huggar:]</i>
so take these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again
(until the end of time)
so i can fly away, until the end of time
until the end of time, until the end of time

<i>[twopac:]</i>
please, lord, forgive me for my life of sin
my hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
so you know, i don't hang around the house much
this all night money making got me outta touch
shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
an unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
my attitude got me walking solo
ride out alone in my lo-lo
watching the whole world move in slow-mo
for quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
smoking 'ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
who can i trust in this cold world?
my phony homie had a baby by my old girl
but i ain't trippin', i'm a player, i ain't sweatin' him
i sexed his sister, had her mumble like a mexican
his next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
besides rappin' the only thing i did good was scrappin'
until the end of timeâ¦

<i>[r.l. huggar:]</i>
so take these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again
(until the end of time)
so i can fly away, until the end of time
until the end of time, until the end of time

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now who's to say if i was right or wrong
to live my life as an outlaw all along?
remain strong in this planet full of player haters
they conversate, but death row full of demonstrators
and in the end, drinking hennessy
made all my enemies envy me
so cold when i flow, eliminatin' easily
falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
while beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
when i conceive closer to achieve
in times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a g
follow my lead, i'll supply everything you need
an ounce of game and the training to make a g
remember me as an outcast outlaw
another album out, that's what i'm about, more
getting raw 'til the day i see my casket, buried as a g
while the whole world remembers me, until the end of time

<i>[r.l. huggar:]</i>
so take these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again

when thugs cry
now i lay me down to sleep
i pray the lord my guns to keep
if i die before i wake
i pray the lord my soul to take
got us dyin'
when thugs cry, times is hard

born thuggin', and lovin' the way i came up
big money clutchin', bustin' while evadin' cocaine busts
my pulse rushin', semi clutchin' into insanity
they shot at my cousin, now we bustin' at they whole family
the coppers wanna see me buried, i ain't worried
i got a line on the d.a. 'cause i'm fuckin' his secretary
i black out and start cussin', bust 'em and touch 'em all
they panic, and bitches duckin', i rush 'em and fuck 'em all
i'll probably be an old man before i understand
why i have to live my life with pistols close at hand
kidnapped my homie's sister, cut her face up bad
they even raped her, so we blazed they pad
automatic shots rang out, on every block
they puttin' hits out on politicians, even cops
i ain't lyin', they got me sleepin' with my infrared beams
and in my dreams i hear motherfuckers screamin'
what is the meanin' when thugs cry?

<i>[singer (twopac):]</i>
oh, why should you send your child off to die?
in the streets of chalk where they lie
let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear god (when thugs cry)
oh my, does it have to be this way?
our children of today won't stay wise
let the children hear when thugs cry, dear god, oh why?

maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'
where is the love?, never quit my ambition to thug
ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
niggas i used to love, enclosed in penitentiaries
but still, homie, keep it real, how does it feel
to lose your life, over something that you did as a kid?
you all alone, no communication, block on the phone
don't get along with your pop, and plus your moms is gone
where did we go wrong? i put my soul in the song
to help us grow in time, but now our minds are gone
we went from brothers and sisters to niggas and bitches
we went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches
but somethin' changed in this dirty game, everything's strange
lost all my homies over cocaine, mayne
see, they ask me if i shed a tear, i ain't lie
see, you gotta get high or die, 'cause even thugs cry

oh, why should you send your child off to die?
in the streets of chalk where they lie
let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear god
oh my, does it have to be this way?
our children of today won't stay wise
let the children hear when thugs cry, dear god, oh why?

and all i see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures
bustin' motherfuckers with uppercuts, i leave 'em with dentures
'cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the don
i write your name wit' a piece of paper, now your family's gone
why perpetrate like you can handle my team?
so merciless in my attack i take command of your dreams
leavin' motherfuckers drownin' in they own blood
clownin', takin' pictures later
laugh 'bout them punk bitches that turned snitches
regulate my area, the terror i represent
makin' your people disappear, you wonderin' where they went
am i cold, or is it just i sold my soul?
addicted to these streets, never find true peace i'm told
come take my body, god, don't let me suffer any longer!
smoke a pound of marijuana, so i know it ain't long
where is the end to all my misery, is there a close?
i suppose that's why i murder my foes; when thugs cry

oh, why should you send your child off to die?
in the streets of chalk where they lie
let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear god
oh my, does it have to be this way?
our children of today won't stay wise
let the children hear when thugs cry, dear god, oh why?

oh, why should you send your child off to die?
in the streets of chalk where they lie
let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear god
oh my, does it have to be this way?
our children of today won't stay wise

i shed tattooed tears for years
for my dead homeboys and my prison peers

now you wonder why would you die?

while niggas run i'm the last one standin', the rest die
victims of my lethal chrome cannon, westside
though it's worldwide no one can deny my views
tracked it to my very fabric once the plastic blew
five shots changed my whole life, throats were slit
niggas die by my orders when i wrote this shit
though we go back like wild knights at latin quarters
niggas tried to kill me, and i fed their wife and their daughters
blazed the weed, draped they seeds, gave 'em cash
pass the fame and let the game go rollin' past
why you change, it's a cold world taught me life
retaliation proves niggas never caught me right
say they shot me in my nuts, out of luck
quit bullshit nigga 'cause i'm still fuckin' yo' bitch

i hear even the smaller g's be dippin' chevy impalas
while flossin' their gold d's, o.g.'s, is who they follow
we swallow tomorrow's seed, what we leave is hollow
we feed violence and greed, let 'em lead tomorrow
in time, they grip a nine, sippin' wine, they rap
still i be starin', watch the parents sacrifice their child
the love's gone, a thug's home, with no love
feelin' so strong, make young boys into drug dealers
now one for adolescents, now dos for those
keep your friends by your side, even close your foes
now three for johnny law tryin' to take my chips
i never pulled the trigger, didn't touch that bitch
throw your hands in the air, it's a robbery
(censored) 'pac, would you ride with me?
let's go see what our enemies talkin' 'bout
when g's enter the house nobody's walkin' out
this ain't livin', it's similar to prison, we're trapped
my homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped
i watch my back twenty-fo' seven
and never let a busta send a g to ghetto heaven, you know
this is how it goes when we floss with flows
before i toss your ho, it'll cost you mo'
i do shows, make a lot of dough, murder my foes
but i'd give it all up, if it would help you grow
this ain't livin'

they're our seeds and when they bleed, we bleed
that's what becomes of lonely children, they turn to g's

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i went from, nothin' to somethin' now they all wanna see me fall
and the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ballin'
and they say we hate the east coast, but that's funny
got a lot of love for, any niggas gettin' money
i made a song about my enemies and niggas tripped
it was hip-hop until twopac fucked biggie bitch
y'all niggas hypocrites and bitch made
now either love me or hate me but real thug niggas get paid
have me catchin' cases all across the nation
i went from jail to bail to barely on probation
they got a player facin' three strikes
and we might, just blast god bless the child, that can get cash
but all these niggas turnin' and never learn
got a long line of niggas player hatin' me but gettin' burned
talk a lot of shit but you's a trick in drag
like the mac make you fall back and stick yo' ass for back stab

<i>[singers &amp; twopac:]</i>

what you need nigga? anything at all come to me nigga
you can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
but then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
my time away just made perfection, did you think i'd die?
i never got a single visit yet i carry on
all my old friends too busy now my money gone
said i got raped in jail, picture that? <i>[*laughter*]</i>

<i>[twopac:]</i>
hehehe, yeah
these are my words to my firstborn

<i>[twopac:]</i>
can you picture young niggas in a rush to grow?
'til hard-timers in the pen' had to crush his throat
probably never even saw it comin'
too busy bullshittin', caught him with his mouth runnin'
ain't this a bitch? they got me twisted in this game
the feds and the punk police pointin' pistols at my brain
i wonder if i'm wrong 'cause i'm thugged out
my homies murdered execution style runnin' in the drug house
what was supposed to be a easy hit
now shit is flipped, 'cause niggas died over bullshit
it's not my dream, i'm seein' pictures of a broken man
no witnesses only the questions of who smoked the man
young adolescents in our prime live a life of crime
though it ain't logical, we hobble through these tryin' times
livin' blindâlord, help me with my troubled soul
why all my homies had to die 'fore they got to grow?
and right before i put my head on the pillow, say a prayer
one love to the thugs in heaven, i'll see you there
it's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned
help you make it through the storm
my words to my firstbornâfeel me!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
my words to my firstborn
my words to my firstborn

<i>[twopac:]</i>
since my very first day on this earth, i was cursed
so, i knew that the birth of a child would make my life worse
and though it hurt me, there was no distortion
'cause wild seeds can't grow, we need more abortions
quiet your soul, 'cause you know what you had to do
and so did victims of a world they never came to
i understand it's a better day comin', sometimes cats be sleepin' on the dead end, drivin' with the car runnin'
blinded, ain't no love in the hood, only hearts torn
love letters to the innocent and unborn
all the babies that died up on the table
wasn't able to breathe, 'cause the family wasn't able
can't blame her, i would do the same
all i could give her was my debt and my last name
'cause in the game things change, livin' up and down
this hard life got me walkin' with my head down
flashin' frowns wasn't meant to be, was i wrong?
but i'll never get to know, so i carry on
it's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
my words to my firstbornâfeel me!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
my words to my firstborn
mmm! (yeah)
these are the words to my firstborn
hey, nigga, talk to your born!
talk to your seed, nigga!

<i>[above the law:]</i>
two thousand somethin' somethin' mention a new era
a nigga's too real, now see shit too clear
see, there's more than just this scrilla and this tilt
(what else is it, dawg?) â the velvet and the silk
and makin' sure my kittens got they milk
(hoo!) gotta fill this mattress
let my kids know i'm at this
attack this, the mack must roll, hood stroll
ain't no question, is it? above the law hustlers
if it's related to chips, homie, we'll handle ya

yo, although we never take advantage
though we always into ery'thang
by all means, stack green, gangsta lean
they say money make the world go 'round
so, only associate yourself
with paper chasers and niggas that's truly down
and keep god first
and give thanks for the good times, as well as when it hurts
it's player haters every corner you hit
touchin' their tits, hella thick, tryin' to get you for yo' grip
i know you stressed-out and fed-up
but come out, gun-blazin', and keep yo' head up
you can call it what you want to, but it ain't gon' change
above the law, twopac, o.g.'s in this rap game
and we done lived a long hard life
and we done shed so many tears under these bright lights
y'all, although we grew up corrupted and scorned
we still got a lot of wisdom to give to our firstborn

<i>[twopac:]</i>
what you gon' tell your kids, nigga?
who was you? what was you doin'?
how did you put it down?
these my words to my motherfuckin' firstborn
so, they can know, y'knahmean? hehehe
ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' rider
westside 'til i die, that's all it was
it's a crooked-ass hand they deal a motherfucker

somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
and even though we both came from the same places
the money and the fame made us all change places
how could it be? through the misery that came to pass
the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask for currency
but you could run to me when you need and i'll never leave
honestly, someone to believe in, as you can see
it's a small thang to a true, what could i do?
real homies help you get through
and come to knew he'd do the same thang if he could
cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
and half the times we be actin' up call the cops
bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
it never stops, when my mama ask me, "will i change?"
i tell her yea, but it's clear i'll always be the same
until the end of time

so take, these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again
(until the end of time)
so i can fly, 'til the end of time
take, these broken wings...

<i>[twopac:]</i>
please lord forgive me for my life of sin
my hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
so you know, i don't hang around the house much
this all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit
ain't flashed a smile in a long while
an unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
my attitude got me walkin' solo, ride out alone in my lo-lo
watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
for quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
smokin' 'ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
who can i trust in this cold world?
my phony homie had a baby by my old girl
but i ain't trippin' i'm a player i ain't sweatin' him
i sexed his sister, had her mumble like a mexican
his next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen
besides rappin' the only thing i did good was scrappin'
until the end of time

<i>[richard page:]</i>
take, these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again
(until the end of time)
so i can fly, 'til the end of time
take, these broken wings...

<i>[richard page:]</i>
take, these broken wings
you got to learn to fly, learn to live so free
(until the end of time)
so we can fly away, 'til the end of time
take, these broken wings...

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now who's to say if i was right or wrong?
to live my life as an outlaw all along
remain strong in this planet full of player haters
they conversate but death row full of demonstrators
and in the end drinkin' hennessy made all my enemies envy me
so cold when i flow eliminatin' easily
falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
while beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
when i conceive closer to achieve
in times of danger don't freeze, time to be a g
follow my lead i'll supply everything you need
an ounce of game and the trainin' to make a g
remember me, as an outcast outlaw
another album out, that's what i'm about, more
gettin' raw 'til the day i see my casket
buried as a g while the whole world remembers me
until the end of time

<i>[richard page:]</i>
take, these broken wings

i don't know what it is that got me actin' all crazy out here
guess it's just my environment, how you people be treatin'
(until the end of time)
shit, i'll be back in a while?
ain't no mystery, you get what you give, feel me?
when it comes i'll be like, i can't tell you what?
maybe it's the thug in me


<i>[reporter:]</i>
good evening.
<i>[*sirens in the background*]</i>
i'm reporting live from sunset boulevard where many excited fans have gathered with candles <i>[*crowd starts chanting "twopac"*]</i> awaiting the much anticipated release, of twopac shakur's latest album, better dayz.
this is yet another post-humous release by twopac which, raises the question 
"where are these songs coming from?" 
it's interesting how the message in these songs is still relevant today.
even in his death he's touching people with his lyrics.
i can feel the energy in the air as they count down to midnight when the album will officially be released.
oh, hold on. i think they're starting to countdown now.

<i>[crowd:]</i>
five, four, three, two, one.


<i>[twopac:]</i>

and i ride for any nigga who believe in the shit; still ballin'

<i>[twopac:]</i>

what they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?
used to love niggas, now i plug niggas, and slug niggas
am i wrong? niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
must be gone on stress weed, in the west we trust

shinin' back to brighten up the sky; how many die?

i bet you motherfuckers die

come take a journey through my mind's eye
you crossed the game, don't explain
nigga, time to die; say goodbye
watch my eyes when i pull the trigger
so right before you die, you bow before a bigger nigga
now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
niggas love to scream "peace!" after they start some shit
pay attention, here's a word to those that robbed me
i murder you, then i run a train on mobb deep
don't fuck with me!
nigga, you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
see me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well
hell, how many niggas wanna be involved?

<i>[kadafi:]</i> 
now, could you picture my criminal status at its fuckin' peak?
even the baddest be gettin' murdered in they seats
i'm addicted to these streets, like crack is to these creeps
seein' visions of a prison, wake up screamin' in my sleep
is there a heaven in this hell? a possibility of livin' well?
but if they killin' me, i get my stripes and whose to tell
choosin' to sell, i'd rather die and be deceased
world mob figure addicted to these fuckin' streets

<i>[e.d.i.:]</i>
now, put your muthafuckin' hands up if you's a rider (ride)

for my profit pick my glock up

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now of course i want peace on the streets, but realistically
paintin' perfect pictures ain't never worked, my misery
was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures
in my quest for cash i learned fast, usin' violent measures
memories of adolescent years, there was unity
but after puberty, we brought war to our community
so many bodies droppin', it's gotta stop, i wanna help
but still i'm steppin', keep my weapon, must protect myself
the promise of a better tomorrow ain't never reached me
plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
sippin' thunderbird and grape kool-aid, callin' earl
since my stomach was empty it seduced me to fuck the world
watch my lil' homies lose they childhoods to guns
nobody cries no more, 'cause we all die for fun
so why you ask me if i want peace if you can't grant it?
niggas fightin' across the whole planet
so it could never be peace

<i>[twopac:]</i>
will there ever be peace, or are we all, just headed for doom?
still consumed by the beast?
and i know there'll never be peace
that's why i keep my pistol when i walk the streets 
'cause there could never be peace

<i>[kastro:]</i> 
somebody owes me. will they control me? not
i ain't a hater player, but i want all you got
y'all babies had babies, now we fightin' each other
my dawgs got frabies, they bitin' each other
and it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
bigfully is a bullet and he don't mind dyin'
and i gotta be blind, missed sign after sign
time after time after time after time
and i don't like nobody, they don't like me more
and i'm good with that finally, but they heard it before
dawg, we livin' in a prison, losin' our religion
on thanksgivin' we thankful, just for livin' in hell
damn, homie, i don't mean to be harsh
but there's a devil in the ghetto tryin' to tear it apart
and if we make it up out, we still stuck in the dark
will there ever be peace? just a piece of my heart. never!

<i>[outlawz:]</i>
the only peace we got is a piece of our heart, piece of our mind, or that damn piece that we hold in our waistline
you feel me, dawg? c'mon, uh

<i>[twopac:]</i>
so will there ever be peace
or are we all just headed for doom?
still consumed by the beast?
and i know there'll never be peace (never)
that's why i keep my pistol when i walk the streets
'cause there'll never be peace

<i>[e.d.i.:]</i>
thangs is changin', nigga, you better read the signs
i'm only concerned about me and mine in these times 
the world is a ghetto and peace is not a part of it
we all believe god's new plan to make it out of this
niggas spendin' too much time hatin' on each other
niggas buyin' guns, loadin' 'em up, aimin' at each other
and the victim is you and me, it's sick, but it's true indeed
the good die, mostly over bullshit, repeatedly
deep in me there's a part that wants nothing but love 
but the rest of me know, war is what's waitin' for us
so i stays ready, keep my pay heavy and boss up
stack my funds and my guns, never rely on luck
askin' god to point out the impostor
never let no weapon formed against me prosper 
'cause there'll never be peace, so don't rely on it, soldiers dyin' for it, and in the ghetto, they cryin' for it. but fuck peace!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
will there ever be peace, or are we all just, headed for doom? still consumed by the beast?
and i know there'll never be peace
that's why i keep my pistol when i walk the streets
fool, there'll never be peace
will there ever be peace, or are we all just, headed for doom? still consumed by the beast?
and i know there'll never be peace
that's why i keep my pistol when i walk the streets
nigga, there'll never be peace
will there ever be peace, or are we all just, headed for doom? still consumed by the beast?
and i know there'll never be peace
that's why i keep my pistol when i walk the streets
nigga, there'll never be peace
will there ever be peace? 

<i>[twopac:]</i>
will there ever be peace? shit, fuck peace!
on the strength 'til my niggas get a piece, we can't have peace
how the fuck we gon' live happy when we ain't got nothing?
you motherfuckers are smilin', but i'm mean muggin'
why? 'cause i gotta be thuggin'
it seems drugs done turned this whole mothafuckin' hood out
all us niggas actin' up, wild-ass motherfuckin' adolescents
these niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more 
how the fuck can you have a childhood
and you at the funeral every motherfuckin' weekend?
pssh, and you motherfuckers talkin' about peace?
nigga, it ain't no motherfuckin' peace
you ain't seen the news motherfucker? you ain't heard? lil' babies gettin' smoked, motherfuckers killin' they whole family
lil' kids gettin' thrown off buildings
motherfuckers gettin' abused
peace? nigga, is you out your fuckin' mind?
fuck peace! we can't never have peace 'til you motherfuckers clean up this mess you made
'til you fuckin' clean up the dirt you dropped
'til we get a piece, fuck peace! westside


young mothers (that's right)
i feel ya (hey) 
i know how it is 
mama's just a little girl (just a little girl)
don't nobody understand 
i feel ya 

<i>[twopac:]</i>
she was born a heavy set girl with pigtails and curls
a heart full of gold, still it won't change the world
though she could never understand why 
some underhanded plans witnessed a man die
was only fifteen, should have been a beauty queen, still
see her cryin' by the caskets when her parents got killed
little girl don't cry, cuz even though they died
you can best believe they're watchin' over thee from the sky
never asked for this misery, but look at what you're gettin'
it's a blessin' in disguise when you find out you're pregnant
no money, no home, and even though you're all alone
you gots to do this on your own, so baby gone
i wish you luck and if you need me, call
just come to me and let me feed you all 
i can understand the way it feels when you're fightin' the world
facin' all this drama when mama's just a little girl

<i>[kimma hill:]</i>
mama don't know why
mama's just a little girl 
livin' if she is or not
time ain't on her side 
cause mama's just a little girl (mama's just a little girl)
she gotta hold her head up high 

<i>[twopac:]</i>
at sixteen
what a beautiful thing, the very essence of a jet-black ebony queen
and who could tell she'd get pregnant at an early age? (what?!)
she didn't listen, had sex, watch her belly raise (hey)
got violated by someone she dated 
if this is fate, i'd hate to see the seeds she created, and so we waited
though it takes time to build a body and a mind
she reclines nine months then finally it's time
what do we find? little growin' boy of mine
with a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime
had no time for the growin' stage
he learned his values on the streets at an early age 
watch for police, don't come home (why?)
cuz mama's actin' crazy at the hospit-al
'bout to have another baby 
like a rose from the concrete, growin' within
blessed with twins how the hell can mama raise three men?
so we began, closest family, such insanity
a happy home, from one act of inhumanity
plus mama said the seed was corrupted
used to rub her belly, beggin' us to breathe and she'd loved us
now, mama, sits quiet, sippin' peppermint schnapps
turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey) 
how could mama bring a thug like me in this world?
she ain't the cause of all the drama 
cause mama's just a little girl

<i>[kimma hill:]</i>
mama don't know why (stupid motherfuckers don't know)
mama's just a little girl 
livin' if she is or not
time ain't on her side 
cause mama's just a little girl (mama's just a little girl)
she gotta hold her head up high 
(how could she raise us) 

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now, will she remain in the same spot?
the gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot
now, look here, i see her clutchin' her son in her arms, she's hurt
her heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt
fulfilled prophecy
but who could stop the grief i walk around, tryin' to hold the world, up on top of me
i'd probably be an innocent man, still i'm the victim of a curse
what could be worse? nothing but pain, since my birth
only functions at the pen', cuz everybody's in
payin' back society, i'm guilty of a life of sin
i watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before i jetted
i wonder why we all have to die 'fore we get it
though we shed tears, so many peers i've done buried
worried and scared, knowin' i'ma see the cemetery
must be prepared, in this cold world, no one cares
no! it ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share
in this land of the underhanded schemes and plans
vivid dreams of a nigga havin' g's in hand
mama told me not to be a punk
fuck what you talkin' about, coward, what you niggas want? (hey)
there ain't a thing i wouldn't do for my mama in this world
cause you know i ain't mad at cha, you're just a little girl (heyheyy)
hell naw, (that's right) see mama's just a little girl (mama's just a little girl)

<i>[kimma hill:]</i>
mama don't know why
mama's just a little girl (mama's just a little girl)
livin' if she is or not
(y'all ain't facin' all this drama cause mama just a little girl)
time ain't on her side
cause mama's just a little girl (mama's just a little girl)
she gotta hold her head up high 

<i>[twopac:]</i>
they ask us why we mutilate each other like we do 
and wonder why we hold such little worth for human life (facin' all this drama, when mama's just a little girl)
to ask us why we turn from bad to worse, is to ignore from which we came (mama's just a little girl)
you see, you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had
damaged petals
on the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity
we would all love its will to reach the sun 
well, we are the roses (we are the roses)
this is the concrete (this is the concrete)
and these are my damaged petals (these are my damaged petals)
don't ask me why (don't ask why)
thank god, nigga (thank god)
ask me how (ahahaha)
you see, mama's just a little girl
mama (hey)...
mama...


turn it up in my head phones, please
comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
more, ha ha, comin' to a ghetto near you

i wasn't mad until these tricks shot me
it's time i sanitize my posse
look how paranoid these niggas got me 
cellular calls are being traced since surveillance silently
mama, chill, thug livin' pay the bills, i'm dyin' violently
closed caskets, expose bastards, i leave 'em bloody
delores tucker, don't let your kids
hear a nigga speak on gettin' money
ain't nothin' funny, green got a nigga seein' things
why? hit the lye, hope to god i can fly
lethal weapon, i'm a savage; still a method to my madness
blast niggas, laugh, call 'em care cabbage
read 'em and weep, put 'em to sleep, they hell bound
lyrics will leave 'em spell bound
clown, now tired of being held down
cross my heart, hope to die, blind with some pussy
millionaire, livin' care free, sucka free, playa haters miss me
hope in hard times never catch me slippin'
fuck authorities! they wonder why minorities be trippin'
we ain't havin' it, time to tear this shit back
ghetto children kick back
once i hit the mac, niggas'll never get they shit back
spit it so eloquently, my pistols represent me
bust until my rounds empty; back for the street fame

one love to my true thugs
comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
bust! comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
all out warfare, eye for a eye 
bustin' on my enemies, bad boy killin'
straight dissin' you
fuck lil' kim, you nasty bitch!

temperatures rises, niggas blinded by my lyrical disguise
no time to plot retreats, niggas shiver and die
multiple rounds found laced in his body and face
wrapped in plastic, the acid erased all traces
criminal tactics, the rap game became so drastic
military mind, mash all the hoes, get blasted
if we bleed then they suffocate, chokin' in terror
so we strive seein' our lives be reflected in mirrors
the prophecy is clear, niggas lock and load, disappear
strategize with no fear, wagin' war for years
the crack game wasn't big enough, ready to rush
bitch made motherfuckers get murdered and touched
i go to jail niggas screamin' free me, speakin' freely
conversatin' with my comrades kickin' swahili
indeed they should fear my first seed
it gets worse, planned a curse to be a g, on the first to breathe
currency in stacks, artillery in the back
strapped, armies, we camouflaged in all black
when we attack, holla out my set, nigga
tighten your jaw, givin' birth to outlawz, street fame

bust, nigga bust!
comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
only makaveli the don
can put it down like this; ain't none like me
comin' to a ghetto near you, with street fame

positive identification, got me rushed to the station
stuck in this line up, tryin' hard to hide my face
they placed the name but can't recall description 
i ain't did shit, officer, that bitch trippin'
promise retaliation, their plan busted, no man to be trusted
everything corrupted once man touch it
kamikaze, hopin' that none of the spies find me
that's why we bye bye daily, knowin' cops trail me
but why cry? floatin' while we tokin' on this potent branch
flossin' in the thug stance, pistol tucked inside my pants
never underestimate me, playa hate me, see me and hide
sure as hollow-points shatter, enemies die
spread love, dead thugs gettin' buried in riches
take a chance to advance; fuck them worryin' bitches!
penitentiary's a possibility, bust and pray 
wear a rubber so i live to fuck another day, hey!
ain't nothin' strange, i'm twenty-five, dyin' to change
but still i bang wantin' street fame

that's the end of that
thugged out, makaveli the don 
representin' the outlawz, street fame
one love to my true niggas
comin' to a ghetto near you street fame
makaveli the don, killuminati
comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame

yo, check this out, i'ma tell you like this
if the lifestyle that you livin'
got you taking more fuckin' shorts than gettin' props
then that lifestyle need to stop 
best to recognize some outlaw shit 
'cause only in this outlaw lifestyle can you truly come to
to see what this life's supposed to be like 
nigga, you'll start to see riches
fine bitches and hittin' switches
shit, to me that shit sound delicious; street fame


hell yeah <i>[*twopac yawning*]</i>
hahaha

<i>[twopac:]</i>
and uh, i started out dumb, sprung off a hood-rats
listenin' to the radio, wishin' that i could rap
but nothing changed, i was stuck in the game
'cause everybody in the industry was fuckin' me, mayne
listen, i got a scheme, break away, do my own thang
drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
niggas ain't wanna see me rise
ninety-seven watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
and if i catch another case, lord knows how they hate me
got a player in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
i've been dealt a lot of bad cards livin' as a thug
count my blessings and throw my stressings in this land with no love
maybe they seen me rollin', look at all this green i'm holdin'
i get this why they envious and get they eyes swollen
hopin' the heavenly father love a hustler
meet the hardest nigga on the earth to ever bust a nut
my homies tell me, "have a heart" â fuck they feelings
i've been tryin' to make a million since we started, we cold hearted
niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force 
empty out my clip, time to mash, they asked for it
me, makaveli, i'm a motherfucker
we break bread, now we thug brothers, haha
niggas talk a lot of non-shit i choose to ignore it
a war? they ain't ready for it haha

partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
pushin', pullin' and twistin' i'm on a mission got me on the mash
tried to dig, you was screamin' when i did
steady yellin' out spots for me to hit, and "aw shit"
soon as i seen her saw us playin' hide the weiner
wanna "freak like me", fuck adina
up and down is the object, side to side
make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, "can i cum inside?"
say you don't feel it that's a lie
you just scared to get this penitentiary dick
the trot caught your eye when i walked by
i said, "hi."
but you was so shy, i can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
you want me to lick it and even worse
got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange

close your eyes, let me heat it up
cause when we fuck i refuse to bust a nut until i beat it up
drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
baby throw yo' legs out the window
remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
and let me hit it where it counts and flee
remember me? "i get around," and i'm haunted by my "temptations"
sexual participation, my motivation
even though i like the way you work it
you don't deserve it cause you walk around actin' like you perfect
took a while but i finally got it, and like a boss player

in bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin'

doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until i blast
and then i laugh as we lay back
see i wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
cause you actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
i had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me

hustlin' bitches like drug dealers

so why don't you kick some of that shit, nigga only you know how
hahahah, feel me?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i'm barely standin', and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
some alize and cristal guaranteed to get right
like misdemeanors is a small thang
with dj quik in this bitch, i let my balls hang
runnin' through the street lights, cause we like
yo' nigga get your mob on show 'em what a g like
around the corner it's like vegas, or better yet like reno
niggas poppin', welcome to our casino, cause you and me know
hundred percent like a c-note
lookin' for a bitch that's half-black and filipino
and when i meet her i'ma offer her some indo
tongue-kissin' on the window of a pearl white limo
don't wanna be your man, i'm your nigga
touch me here, i'll get bigger
while i'm diggin' i'll get deep into your liver
i'm game type
love fuckin' bitches in the same night
my words are aphrodisiacs if you say 'em right
the club be poppin' so i'm stoppin' at the fat burger
look through the paper it's another black crack murder
the city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
you can fuck on the first night, or try
in the late night

<i>[samples (twopac):]</i>
"last night.. last night changed it all" 
(in the late night!)
"last night.."
"i don't give a fuck, where you gon' be. be home by eleven!"

<i>[hussein fatal:]</i>
around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
i clock rocks in the rain 'til my socks is damp
ain't nuttin like bein' a thug when i can just
sit on the row of death straight knowin' that i'm blessed
hussein fatal, flawless fatality
overdosin' on crime, three steps from reality
get up to get down, represent your town, last night
was poppin' like like cocked glocks with hollow-tip rounds

<i>[kadafi:]</i>
from booty-calls to bail sheets
it ain't no tellin' if i wake up in the county in my jail sheets
my intuitions and ambitions up in the late night 
probably involves me comin' up with just to see another day
might
be me who bites the bullet
in these streets where a man journey
with crooked cops and a society who tryin' to burn me
i'm like a pit in a cage, spittin' my shells in a gauge
deadly as aids, niggas gettin' crossed like a maze
now picture me livin' my life like a king, maybe one day
until then i'm livin' monday through sunday
bringin' the gun play for all these beefs and battles
when we collide, i'ma ride on that hide like cattle, cowards best to skedaddle
in the late night

"last night.. last night changed it all" 
"last night.."
"i don't give a fuck, where you gon' be. be home by eleven!"
"last night.. last night changed it all"

<i>[twopac:]</i>
money and multiple gunshots are shown, large amps are blown
niggas in low-lows, pursuin' mo' hoes, then go home
the life of a california star, and when you see me
in the drop-top jag', how many niggas wanna be me?
game is automatic, mandatory i sell
to live or die, i survive, but with a story to tell
cause when you gettin' some riches, watch for dumb bitches
they have you labeled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissin'
it's a mean world nigga you strapped, must be a throwaway
will i survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
nobody knows me, i'm a shadow
my army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
cause when i'm out in the streets, i'm on point, where the static?
too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
i disappear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
for my niggas up in clinton gettin' weeded
continue to roll until i'm old, ride until i die
supply long as you motherfuckers buy
my homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and duckin'
slappin' niggas known for tellin' bitches fuck-it
in the late night

i hit the weed and hope to god i can fly high
witness my enemies die when i ride by, they shouldn't have tried
i send they bodies to they parents up north
with they faces, they wrists, and they nuts cut off
fuck 'em all what i scream as i dream in tongues
fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter
eat a dick, biyotch mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?
bring it on, forever strapped
introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
just sell me your soul, and live the life (of a ghetto star)

<i>[nutt-so:]</i>
i live the life of a thug nigga, drug dealer livin' game tight
mug niggas, slug niggas for the fame life
laced with game, practice on takin' pain
quick to slang, and let it rain through yo' brain
street smart, proficient, intelligent
and keep suckers hittin' 'til snitches start smellin' it
movin' niggas with telekinesis
keepin' channel seven at work, filmin' different features
leadin' niggas to an early death with they head blown
and to those who didn't make it to the morgue was just dead and gone
and hope niggas got punished
kidnapped, jacked in the back with mac's to they neck, rappers waiting to get done in
back<i>[?]</i> - we tossed his ass out
m.o.b. related, one mo' nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth
printed my name in these streets as a motherfuckin' g
now the next generation's lookin' at me through <i>[?]</i>

<i>[twopac:]</i>
walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to my homies that was buried
see my enemies wanna see me dead, i ain't worried, forgive me
please give me shelter, calm my fears
lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears
i see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid
two shots rang from the plastic glock, wrapped in plastic
buried the bastard, time to notify
his family, sheeit, ain't nothing left to be identified
evacuate the crime scene fast
why, i heard the feds had a warrant for my ass
why, i won't touch down 'til i see tijuana
set up shop selling them crooked cops marijuana
label me a success, i made the switch
retired from the life that never gave me shit
put cash that i couldn't spend, countless cars
an addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star

<i>[nutt-so:]</i>
got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip
no remorse, no repentance as i buck one down
straight to the morgue cause i plan on, shuttin' shit down
born soldier, fucked 'em up with a mac-fo'
torn ligaments, all up in that nigga shoulder
and a vest couldn't protect that flesh
cause i got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest
death, apparently they wasn't sucka free
cause i had all them wannabe thug niggas in protective custody
i guess they heard that i got them birds
thought i was a nerd 'til i bucked one of them to the curb
luxury livin' lavish, with dreams of dyin' rich
with a team and clientele on my mothafuckin' dick
and gettin' down on these snitch bitches, protectin' riches
by givin' stitches, the life as a ghetto star

<i>[twopac:]</i>
when i grow up i wanna be like them
my life as a ghetto star
when i grow up i wanna be like them
my life as a ghetto star
when i grow up i wanna be like them
live my life as a ghetto star
when i grow up i wanna be like them

it's the don makaveli - live my life as a ghetto star


shit, tired of getting shot at
tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
niggaz need a spot where we can kick it
a spot where we belong, that's just for us
niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be hollywood
y'knahmean? where do niggaz go when we die?
ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
that's why we go to thug mansion
that's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a g
... at thug mansion

<i>[twopac:]</i>
a place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
so much pressure in this life of mine, i cry at times
i once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
but when i held that nine, all i could see was my momma's eyes
no one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
picture me inside the misery of poverty
no man alive has ever witnessed struggles i survived
praying hard for better days, promise to hold on
me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
we found a family spot to kick it
where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
a spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we g's
we still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
and in my mind's eye i see this place, the players go in fast
i got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

<i>[j. phoenix (nas):]</i>
every corner, every city
there's a place where life's a little easy
little hennessy, laid back and cool
every hour, cause it's all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright (i wanna go)
nothing but peace (i wanna go) love (i wanna go nigga)
and street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion

<i>[nas:]</i>
a place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rolling by
no policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
no reason, for nobody's momma to cry
see i'm a good guy, i'm trying to stick around for my daughter
but if i should die, i know all of my albums support her
this whole year's been crazy, asked the holy spirit to save me
only difference from me and ossie davis, gray hair maybe
cause i feel like my eyes saw too much suffering
i'm just twenty-some-odd years, i done lost my mother
and i cried tears of joy, i know she smiles on her boy
i dream of you more, my love goes to afeni shakur
cause like ann jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
and just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
where angels soar, with golden wings in thug's mansion

<i>[j. phoenix:]</i>

<i>[twopac:]</i>
dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
tell the homies i'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
seen a show with marvin gaye last night, it had me shook
dripping peppermint schnapps, with jackie wilson, and sam cooke
then some lady named billie holiday
sang sitting there kicking it with malcolm, 'til the day came
little latasha sho' grown
tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
maybe in time you'll understand only god can save us
when miles davis cutting lose with the band
just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
picture a place that they exist, together
there has to be a place better than this, in heaven
so right before i sleep, dear god, what i'm asking
remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

<i>[j. phoenix (nas):]</i>
every corner, every city
there's a place where life's a little easy
little hennessy, laid back and cool
every hour, cause it's all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright (i wanna go)
nothing but peace (i wanna go) love (i wanna go nigga)
and street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion


damn, take a ride to my block
my block, that's right! hehe
'round my motherfuckin' way

they got a nigga sheddin' tears, reminiscin' on my past fears
'cause shit was hectic for me last year
it appears that i've been marked for death, my heartless breast
the underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
and no rest, forever weary; my eyes stay teary
for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
shit is scary, how black-on-black crime legendary
but at times unnecessary, i'm getting worried
teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
and certain death for us ghetto bastards
what can we do when we're arrested but open fire?
life in the pen ain't for me, 'cause i'd rather die
but don't cry through your despair
i wonder if the lord still cares for us niggas on welfare
and who cares if we survive? the only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin' on a four-five
my neighborhood ain't the same, 'cause all these little babies going crazy and they suffering in the game
and i swear it's like a trap
but i ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when i go back
hoes show me love, niggas give me props
forever hop, 'cause it don't stop â on my block

living life is but a dream
hard times is all we seen (on my block)
every block is kind to me
but on the block we still pray
but on the block we still pray

now shit's constantly hot on my block
it never fails to be gunshots
can't explain a mother's pain when her son drops
black males living in hell; when will we prevail?
fearing jail, but crack sales got me living well
and in a sense i'm suicidal with this thug's life
staying strapped, forever trapped in this drug life
god, help me, 'cause i'm starving, can't get a job
so i resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
can't sleep, 'cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
mislead from childhood where i went astray
'til this day i still pray for a better way
can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
from the start i felt the racism 'cause i'm dark
couldn't quit, the bullshit make me represent
hit the bar and played the star everywhere i went
in my heart i felt alone, out here on my own
i close my eyes and picture home â on my block

living life is but a dream
hard times is all we seen (on my block)
every block is kind to me
but on the block we still pray
but on the block we still pray

and i can't help but wonder why so many young kids had to die; caught strays from ak's in a drive-by
swollen pride and homicide don't coincide
brothers cry for broken lives; mama, come inside!
'cause our block is filled with danger
used to be a close knit community
but now we're all cold strangers
time changes us to stone, them crack pipes
all up and down the block, exterminating black life
but i can't blame the dealers; my mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
shit's real, i know you feel my tragedy
a single mother with a problem child, daddy free
hanging out, picking up game, sippin' cheap liquor
gaming the hoochies, hoping i can get to sleep with her
it's a man's world, staying strapped
fantasies of a nigga living phat but held back
pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
wide eyed and losing focus â on my block

living life is but a dream
hard times is all we seen (on my block)
every block is kind to me
but on the block we still pray
but on the block we still pray

and block parties in the projects lasting way past daylight
a young nigga learned to break, right?
used to play fight with my homies, but they stuck in the pen
i send them ends, but it's tough on a friend
in my mind i see the same motherfuckers ballin'
alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
i know the young niggas understand this
growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
i reminisce on the fast times, past crimes
tryin' to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
and what's strange is everybody know my name
swear they all know me, and lots of cash make a nigga change
i hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain
for all the niggas that i lost to the game â from my block

living life is but a dream
hard times is all we seen (on my block)
every block is kind to me
but on the block we still pray
but on the block we still pray

rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed away
from all the blocks that i'm from
one hundred and twelve street, seventh avenue, new york, uptown, knahmsayin'?
one hundred and eighty-threerd and walt, my block â that's right
one hundred and twenty-twond and morningside, my block â that's right
decatur avenue, baltimore, my block â that's right
and the jungle, marin city, that's my block â that's right
los angeles, haha â that's my block too
oakland, can't forget oaktown â that's my block for sure
and all the other blocks around this motherfucker
houston, florida, st. louis, tennessee, miami, chicago
all y'all niggas stay kickin' up dust
represent the motherfuckin' block


<i>[twopac:]</i>
shit, tired of gettin' shot at
tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
niggas need a spot where we can kick it
a spot where we belong, that's just for us
niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be hollywood
y'knahmean? where do niggas go when we die?
ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
that's why we go to thug mansion
that's the only place where thugs get in free
and you gotta be a g, at thug mansion

<i>[twopac:]</i>
a place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
so much pressure in this life of mine
i cry at times, i once contemplated suicide
and would've tried, but when i held that nine
all i could see was my mama's eyes
no one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
picture me inside the misery of poverty
no man alive has ever witnessed struggles i survived
prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
we found a finally spot to kick it
where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
a spot where we can smoke in peace
and even though we g's
we still visualize places that we can roll in peace
and in my mind's eye i see this place
the players go and pass it
i got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

<i>[anthony hamilton:]</i>
ain't no place i'd rather be
chillin' with homies and family
sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
ain't no place i'd rather be
only place that's right for me
chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

<i>[twopac:]</i>
will i survive all the fights and the darkness?
trouble sparks, they tell me, "home is where the heart is."
dear departed, i shed tattooed tears
and couldn't sleep good for multiple years
witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
seen the politicians ban us
they'd rather see us locked in chains
please explain why they can't stand us
is there a way for me to change?
or am i just a victim of things i did to maintain?
i need a place to rest my head
with the little bit of homeboys that remains
'cause all the rest dead
is there a spot for us to roll? if you find it
i'll be right behind ya, show me and i'll go
how can i be peaceful? i'm comin' from the bottom
watch my daddy scream, "peace!"
while the other man shot him
i need a house that's full of love, when i need to escape
the deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

<i>[anthony hamilton:]</i>
ain't no place i'd rather be

<i>[twopac:]</i>
damn â gave my homie ninety days for domestic violence
i try to picture myself in this position but remain silent
i get to thinkin' 'bout this shit we been through
we close like kin, but you remain my friend too
this life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble
but you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why i love you
reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues
swear i can't live with you
but without you, every day i miss you
when we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-itch, you
always in the mood for love, that's why i'm sleepin' with you
though not the man of your dreams
my plan and scheme's to be rich like a king
and live my life trouble free, i see
yesterday i called you names and played games on your mind
i promise that i'll change in time
it's a complicated world so, girl, just be a friend
i swear i'll never call you bitch again (and that's my word)

<i>[tyrese (twopac):]</i>
we came too far to throw it all away
(i swear i'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
we came way too far, pretty baby
to throw it all away, throw it all away
(i swear i'll never call you bitch again, hey)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
nigga still tired so i'm yawnin', and now i'm gone
tryin' to get my money on strong
so an early riser out before them other guys
that's the way to profit every time
can't get too close my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
plus we been beefin' with the east coast, with casualties
got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
but while i'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
my enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
you paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
i promise not to leave you on your own again
cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
it's so frantic but don't panic, 'cause we crossed the top
i found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
i swear i'll never call you bitch again, believe me

<i>[tyrese (twopac):]</i>
we came too far to throw it all away
(i swear i'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
we came way too far, pretty baby
to throw it all away, throw it all away
(i swear i'll never call you bitch again, believe me)

<i>['pac:]</i>
i know, i know, all that is dead though
i'm changed, i'm tellin' you
i know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time
to grow up, ya know what i'm sayin'?
that was way back then

<i>[tyrese:]</i>
you're my nigga, my best friend
never gonna call you a bitch again
yea yea yea, oh

<i>[twopac:]</i>
witness the evil men do, all this shit i been through
never meant to hurt you, can we make this work, boo?
i know you been feelin' pain, things are not the same
waitin' to exhale while i'm sittin' in the county jail
keep your head up, 'cause things are gettin' better
my cellmate shed tears off your last love letter
told him you would find a friend, so keep your eyes peeled
sorry if i cuss, but it's the sufferin' that i feel
who can i trust? and if i bust, will she snitch?
even though you ain't the type to trip, sorry if i called you bitch
you showed me the definition of feminine
the difference between a pack of bitches and black women
huh, i see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon
pictures of us kissin' in the livin' room, in the nude
thanks for being there much more than a friend
i swear i'll never call you bitch again; believe me!

<i>[tyrese (twopac):]</i>
we came too far, to throw it all away
we came way too far, pretty baby
(i swear i'll never call you bitch again, believe me)

we came way too far, pretty baby

through all my ups and downs
you always stayed around stayed around


lookin' for these better days
better days, hey, better days
got me thinkin' about better days
better days, better days, better days
hey, better days
got me thinkin' about better days

time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
smokin' weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids
wanna try now, then lie down and get ran through
nobody watches 'em, clockin' the evil man do
faced with the demons
addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
'cause even our birthdays is cursed days
a born thug in the first place, the worst ways
i'd love to see the block in peace
with no more dealers and crooked cops
the only way to stop the beast
and only we can change
it's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same
too many murders, too many funerals, and too many tears
just seen another brother buried
plus i knew him for years
passed by his family, but what could i say?
keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
and pray for better days

better days, better days
hey, better days
got me thinkin' about better days
better days, better days, better days
hey, better days
got me thinkin' about better days

thinkin' back as an adolescent, who would've guessed
that in my future years i'd be stressin'?
some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
plus my p.o. won't let me hang
with the brothers i grew up with
tryin' to keep my head up and stay strong
all my homies slangin' yayo all day long
but they wrong, so i'm solo and so broke
savin' up for some jordan's, 'cause they dope
i got a girl and i love her, but she broke too
and so am i; i can't take her to the places she wanna go to
so, we argue and play fight, all day and night
makin' passionate love 'til the daylight
plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
guess it's time to see who really is your friend
tell me you pregnant and i'm amazed
so many blessings while we stressin'
lookin' for them better days

better days, better days
hey, better days
got me thinkin' about better days
better days, better days, better days
hey, better days
got me thinkin' about better days

now, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
since back in high school, we was true, me and you
hardly parted or separated, we stayed faded
affiliated with gang-bangers and still made it
up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
out in the dark, smokin' newports, gamin' marks
got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart
locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
i send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
hopin' you well, i know it's hell
doin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail
and me, i'm doin' cool
i settled down, had a family, workin' a night school
every once in a while, i reminisce
and i wonder how we ever came to this; i miss the better days

better days, better days
hey, better days
got me thinkin' about better days
better days, better days, better days
hey, better days
got me thinkin' about better days

i send this one out to all the homeboys down in, uh
clinton lockdown, rikers island
all them dudes i was, uh, locked up with, hehe
e block, f block, lower h
n-i-c in rikers island, downstate
all the peoples i met along the way
better days is comin', homeboy, keep your head up!


<i>[twopac:]</i>
dear baby you the picture of perfection
straight from your million dollar smile
to my attraction to your complexion
no hesitation needed; you got me
inhalin' the aroma of your perfume, and feelin' heated
i move closer to drop the lines of my introduction
hold out my hand, and grab yo' hand, now we touchin'
my lyrics are poetry, so baby get a ticket to go with me
thugged out so you notice me
it's a positive attraction; see pictures of us
layin' butt-naked on the beach kicking back relaxin'
and only you can calm, the savage beast
look in my eyes are you surprised, that it's me?
i wanna make you mine
i'm kissin' on you tryin' to make it different every time (that's right)

me and you in satin sheets, 'til after two
come take a walk on the wild side, enjoy the view
whenever we collide; it's bound to be a pleasurable time
makin' love 'til the early light
sweetheart don't fight the feelin'
come get a shot of this plain dealin' and concentrate on the ceiling
it's my intention to brush up
beware of the fireworks, 'cause every time we touch..
...it's bound to be, so relax, clown with me

the brother with tattoos and no fears
runnin' my fingers through your hair

suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme
introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
got a law for raw niggas, now, playa what it be like?
when will niggas see they got us bleedin' with three strikes
can't seem to focus hopeless, with violent thoughts i wrote this
got these devils petrified, hidin' from my hocus-pocus
and so i learned to earn my currency and over time
affiliated, clearly click a military mind
may god forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
thugged out and drug dealin', from the womb to the block
my live mind got me survivin' five rounds (shots)
my forty-five got me fortified with live rounds
when shit's thick we plot hits, when our glock spits
all hail, out on bail, wrath of the twopacalypse
forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
outlaw thug niggas never left the boot camp

<i>[cocoa brovaz:]</i>

<i>[tek:]</i>
they called us for assignment, one of the squad's finest
skills in guerrilla warfare and blessed with refinement
my rap sheet, contains sections of bomb sessions
says i'm responsible for black smif-n-wessun
putting likkle yout's in a military state of mind
dangerous like chronic and yard when combined 
cocoa brovaz 'pon de borderline
test de sound and ye dead same ti-ime

<i>[steele:]</i>
man to man, i'm facin' the devil with a plan
judo stance, first glance, i'm makin' my advance
animal instincts, intelligence of an assassin
masked men, ninjas that surround me, ready to attack
i react swiftly, what father taught me sticks with me
never forget the method, stick and move strictly
shit be seemin' like it's closin' in
with no regrets i hold position 
'cause i suppose i'm one of the chosen men

<i>[buckshot:]</i>
picture being put in a position to move
and you can't move 'cause your move is blocked by the knight
at twelve o'clock, that's when the madness begins
so i start to focus in, my thoughts on the war
'cause the rule is the law, and the law that we live by
is to stay true to self, in this case, bdi
why try if ya body lie
by the block true soldier mentality, this is how we rock and roll
(this is how we ride)

<i>[boot camp clik:]</i>
stick and move, time to show 'em how to make a move
or get moved on, let's see who strong

<i>[cocoa brovaz:]</i>

<i>[tek:]</i>
in the gaze of the strange, where nothing stays the same
where new faces come through with similar game
now who you thought was them, really ain't
they catchin' deja vus of the game people play
it's a call for readjustment, fine tune yo' position
you slippin' and trippin' 'stead of bobbin and dippin'
but never let this world of stress get the best of me
takin' breathin' techniques, slay you with tai-chi

<i>[steele:]</i>
what does it take, to get a break in the world of snakes
and dose who fake
elimination i'm facin' destruction
outlawed, so i duck and down, fo'-fo' is bustin', no one to trust in
rushin' to the goal line
catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole mine
no swine i'm a soldier, soldier i control mine
time to, take you, back into time - follow dis here

<i>[buckshot:]</i>
one way out, this black hole
for this black soul, shit is outta control
i'm fightin' for my position to be a fetus in this world i'm enterin'
and my face is sentencin' for repentance
before my body was fully formed into a human
i was already consumin' weed
'cause my moms used to smoke back in the seventys
maybe that's why in the ninetys i drop g's when i drop degrees
when i ease across the block with 'pac
got all y'all niggas shocked
you didn't think boot camp clik would link, with a outlaw mind?
if you do you press rewind 
and you can peep guerrilla tactics in every line

<i>[twopac:]</i>
yeah, and this is how we do it!
where my real thugs, where they at?
let me, see my real thugs, now where ya at?
won'tcha, see my real thugs, where ya at?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
and my niggas say 
we want the fame!
come on! come on!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
one thing we all adore 
something worth dyin' for
nothin' but pain
stuck in this game 
searchin' for fortune and fame

<i>[twopac:]</i>
though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to g's
stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
they got me hot when they shot me, plotted
my revenge to increase my ends; enemies gettin' dropped
win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true
play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
and for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame
what's to gain, lost souls? who controls our brain?
who can i blame? the world seems strange at times
somewhat insane, i'm hopin' we can change with time
i'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse
i know, death follows me, but i'll murder him first
and worse yet, with each breathe, steps i take, breathless
is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses
we mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask
i'm the first one to want him blasted
wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit
ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me
nothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fakin' fame

<i>[yaki kadafi:]</i>
block run and shoot slugs 
we throw them back like hardballs 
without the gloves, no love for these fake desperadoes
and thugs i bleed to envy 
smoke and blow out they blunts, sippin' henny
drunk nights, and hot days
cockin' my heat, shootin' it sideways
a wife on the run, full of common blunts
unconditionally married to my gun
fulfillin' my destiny on knees and one's desires
be pullin' all my cabbage like priors, stuck in the trance
searchin' for something higher, the fortune and fame

<i>[twopac:]</i>
one thing we all adore
something worth dyin' for
nothin' but pain
stuck in this game
searchin' for fortune and fame
one thing we all adore
something worth dyin' for
nothin' but pain
stuck in this game
searchin' for fortune and fame

<i>[young noble:]</i>
searchin' for fortune and fame, lost in the rain
a lost of the game, with life the cost of the game
we forcin' the change, motherfuck flossin' a chain
all the blame belongs to the part of the brain
that we never use, nigga, plus my heart is in pain
and if i ever lose, homie, bet i'm at it again
outlaws don't die, so united we stand
and if family come before, all the fortune and fame

<i>[napoleon:]</i>
as i walk up in the crib, laid to rest my head
say salaam to the angels, hope they bless my bed
hope they bless me the righteous way 
got a homie locked down outta town, i sent him a kite today
man, that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it, dawg
prayin' for my downfall, and i can sense it, dawg
i was passed down the street fame 
like glocks clocked and keep aim
was raised up with a clock box 
and i ran with the local street gang 
they say the light is faded but still shine in the dark
you can easy been a man, but you's a boy in your heart
and that's some game that i got from generation of game
in the road of life, dog
we need to switch up lanes â think about it!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
one thing we all adore
something worth dyin' for
nothin' but pain
stuck in this game
searchin' for fortune and fame
one thing we all adore
something worth dyin' for
been nothin' but pain
stuck in this game
searchin' for fortune and fame

<i>[bad azz:]</i>
i can't complain, i've seen my fair share of the fame
it won't change me, now i've got this piece of change
i feel strange, i got so used to the hood
that when i finally got out at first it ain't feel good
i was just a baby, still retarded from slavery
when we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me
ghetto ain't made me, i made myself
poverty raised me, thinking ain't no help
i pray for my health, my mind, and my family too
state of myself, my grind, and my family crew
where one hand washes the other
no, we ain't blood, but we still real brothers
the struggle is real, nothin' can steal what we build
and that remains the same 'til the day that we killed
and that's real, life that i was aimed to be
love by my family tree, that's fame to me â how about it?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
one thing we all adore
something worth dyin' for
nothin' but pain

<i>[mya:]</i>
no, no...

picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
pushin', pullin' and twistin' i'm on a mission got me on the mash
tried to dig, you was screamin' when i did
steady yellin' out spots for me to hit, and "aw shit"
soon as i seen her saw us playin' hide the weiner
wanna "freak like me", fuck adina
up and down is the object, side to side
make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, "can i cum inside?"
say you don't feel it that's a lie, you just scared to get this
penitentiary dick, the trot caught your eye
when i walked by, i said, "hi"
but you was so shy, i can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
you want me to lick it and even worse
got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange

<i>[mya:]</i>
only one thing that you, can do, for me
baby you can treat me right, we can do it all the night
nothin' more than our fair exchange
hit my g-spot and make, me scream, your name
you can do whatever you want, i got what i want and gone
nothin' more than our fair exchange

open your legs
got me marchin' like it's a million, you tremble from the feelin'
look up, cause i got mirrors on the ceilin'
and if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine
and just for fun, i betchu i can make you cum sixty-one times
close your eyes, let me heat it up
cause when we fuck i refuse to bust a nut until i beat it up
drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
baby throw yo' legs out the window
remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
and let me hit it where it counts and flee
remember me? "i get around," and i'm haunted by my "temptations"
sexual participation, my motivation
even though i like the way you work it
you don't deserve it cause you walk around actin' like you perfect
took a while but i finally got it, and like a boss player
bitch you ain't doin' me no favors
fair exchange

<i>[mya:]</i>
only one thing that you, can do, for me
baby you can treat me right, we can do it all the night
nothin' more than our fair exchange
hit my g-spot and make, me scream, your name

nothin' more than our fair exchange

now yo' attitude ain't realistic
yeah it's true i'm gettin' pussy, but baby you gettin' dick!
and since you bein' laced with the penetration
it's only right to show a form of appreciation
instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
in bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin'
you said take it so i'm blind in my passion, how long will i last?
doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until i blast
and then i laugh as we lay back
see i wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
cause you actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
i had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
a true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
before i say goodbye, put an end to all the games
here's my number for another fair exchange

<i>[mya:]</i>
(it's only one!!!) only one thing that you, can do (thing that you can do for me), for me
baby you can treat me right, we can do it all the night

you can get whatever you want, i got what i want and gone
nothin' more than our fair exchange
only one thing that you (whatever you want), can do, for me
baby you can treat me right (can you do me), we can do it all the night
nothin' more than our fair exchange

<i>[intro: twopac]</i>
let us pray
heavenly father, hear a nigga down here
before i go to sleep
tell me, who do you believe in?
who do you believe in?

<i>[verse one: twopac]</i>
i see mothers in black cryin, brothers in packs dyin
plus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why
watchin our own downfall, witness the end
it's like we don't believe in god cause we livin in sin
i asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed
pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast
it's just another murder, nobody mourns no more
my tear drops gettin bigger but can't figure what i'm cryin for
is it the miniature caskets, little babies
victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy
maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was
crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
perhaps the underlyin fact they hide explain genocide
it's when we ride on our own kind
what is it we all fear, reflections in the mirror
we can't escape fate, the end is gettin nearer

<i>[chorus twox: twopac]</i>
who do you believe in?
i put my faith in god, blessed and still breathin
and even though it's hard, that's who i believe in
before i'm leavin, i'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?

<i>[verse two: twopac]</i>
can't close my eyes cause all i see is terror
i hate the man in the mirror
cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
times of armageddeon, murder in mass amounts
in this society where only gettin the cash counts
i started out as a beginner
entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
i make my money and vacate, evade prison
went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven
and all the hennessy and weed can't hide, the pain i feel inside
you know, it's like i'm livin just to die
i fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowin if i'm worthy
livin life thinkin no man can hurt me
so i'm askin -- before i lay me down to sleep
before you judge me, look at all the shit you did to me, my misery
i rose up from the slums, made it out the flames
in my search for fame will i change?  i'm askin

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three: kadafi]</i>
faith in allah, believe in me and this plastic
cause so far i done witnessed to many dead niggaz in caskets
with they chest plates stretched like elastic
and what's worse i'm on front line, holdin down camp, still mashin
heard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block
just came home october of 'ninety-five back in yardsville stuck
with a three to five, if he don't act up, now he realize
if you don't stay wise, then in this game you fucked
talk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard
one of the grimmies is snitchin, diamond a stool pigeon i talked to him
he said he didn't, my man said he did, in fact he's sure
cause he just came home off of bail

<i>[twopac]</i> now tell me

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[outro: spoken word]</i>
who do you believe in?
is it buddah, jehovah, or jah?  or allah?
is it jesus?  is it god?  or is just yourself?
definately not to be imposed, being a demon
because this is the joy of believing!
men, to believe in yourselves
but for sure, the higher power
resides only to ride in the heart of the true
from the soul, of the man; for truth never has an alibi
in the poetry, or in it's realm
that's what pulls all words together
just to understand, that every man, is his own man
and only man can satisfy the man
only the soul of the man, the feelings of the man
the for realness of the man
you can't shake the man when you feel the man you know the man
and you gotta call yourself because you are that man

<i>[twopac:]</i>
y'all ain't never just tripped and pictured 
and just looked at the whole situation 
'cause once you look at it
you know, (really do)

<i>[twopac:]</i>
they don't give a fuck about us 
they don't give a fuck about us 
they don't give a fuck about us 
if i choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day i die
nobody give a fuck about us
and when i start to rise 
a hero in their children's eyes 
now they give a fuck about us 

<i>[twopac:]</i>
some say niggas is hard headed 'cause we love to trick
equipped with game so we bang with this thuggish shit
i see you tryin' to hide, hopin' that nobody don't notice
you must always remember
you're still a member of the hopeless
see, you're black like me, so you snap like me
when these devils try to plot, trap our young black seeds
look it, cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin'
lookin' for role models, our father figures is basers
some say they expect illuminati take my body to sleep 
niggas at the party with they shotties just as rowdy as me
before i fear computer chips, i gotta deal with brothers flippin'
i don't see no devils bleedin', only black blood drippin'
we can change; what your mouth say?
i'm watchin' niggas work their lives out without pay
whatever it takes to switch places with the busters on top
i'm bustin' shots, make the world stop
they don't give a fuck about us 

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now if i choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day i die
nobody gives a fuck about us
but when i start to rise 
a hero in their children's eyes
now they give a fuck about us 
if i choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day i die
nobody gives a fuck about us 
but when i start to rise 
a hero in their children's eyes
now they give a fuck about us 

<i>[e.d.i. mean:]</i>
it's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone 
time to reflect on what you did, 'cause they sayin' you wrong
i'm sure you had your reasons, dawg; i don't doubt you
see, the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you
or them five mouths you forced to feed
not includin' yourself, all you want is wealth, they perceive it as greed
so as you loaded up that mac and continue to buck 'em
i was on paper, thinkin' they don't give a fuck about us

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i'm seein' it clearer, hatin' the picture in the mirror
they claim we inferior, so why the fuck these devils fear ya?
i'm watchin' my nation die, genocide the cause
expect a blood bath, the aftermath is y'alls
i told you, last album, we need help cause we dyin'
give us a chance, help us advance, 'cause we tryin'
ignore my whole plea, watchin' us in disgust
and then they beg when my guns bust 
they don't give a fuck about us 

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now if i choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day i die
nobody gives a fuck about us 
but when i start to rise 
a hero in their children's eyes

<i>[kastro:]</i>
now, all my homies got love for me
down to catch a slug for me 
guaranteed to bleed deeply, now that's love
shit, nobody else could give a fuck
if i'm tore down, from the floor down, six-feet deep in the cut
what the fuck done went wrong?
how long will i be mourned? 
when i'm gone, same song, ain't gave a fuck all along
and who am i to blame 'em?
just do or die through the rainin' 
since they don't give a fuck, i don't; feel what i'm sayin'?

<i>[kadafi:]</i>
now, thug niggas die but multiply in doubles
wrapped in plastic or closed casket for our troubles
pressed in times, we busted, like bubbles
with the police, this nation's peace sent here to run you
now look at what this crooked world has come to 
i grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin' 
man, i still hustle, so i'm dyin' certain
so i spent your time in poor and workin', i see no reason
so i stay ballin' season to season 
why you stuck thinkin' that they give a fuck?

<i>[napolean:]</i>
you tell me my world is in peace, but nigga, you're lyin'
'cause half of my niggas long gone
buried in the dirt just for tryin'
sometimes i think my block is dyin' and that is awful
to wake up to another day, shit ain't changed that's all fool
i wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
seein' me upside down backwards head twisted 
while i'm layin' in the coffin
the shit comes around so often; so tell me somethin'
before i take it out on the world, and get to dumpin' 
nigga, i been so through pain, go through the struggle
doin' the same thing you did at my age, and that's hustlin'
on the edge of straight bustin' 
well, since you don't give a fuck, i be frontin'
and i'ma drink my hennessy like it ain't nothin'

<i>[twopac:]</i>
if i choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day i die
they don't gives a fuck about us
but while i'm kickin' rhymes
kick it to their children's minds
now they give a fuck about us 
they wanna see us die
they kick us every time we try
'cause they don't give a fuck about us
so while i'm gettin' high
i'm watchin' as the world goes by
'cause they don't give a fuck about us
if i choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day i die
they don't gives a fuck about us
but while i'm kickin' rhymes
kick it to their children's minds
now they give a fuck about us
they wanna see us die
they kick us every time we try
'cause they don't give a fuck about us
so while i'm gettin' high
i'm watchin' as the world goes by
'cause they don't give a fuck about us
rise... rise


expect me like you expect jesus to come back
expect me nigga, iâm comin'


<i>[speaking:]</i>
the only way, for me to come back, is by makaveli
that's it! all these motherfuckers stole from me
i'm taking back what's mine

<i>[slowed down voice:]</i>
you motherfuckers can't stop me (laughing)
even if i die, i'm gon' be a fuckin' problem
do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
real live black... ghosts
feel me?

some say i'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
papa was a motherfuckin', joke
used to find dope in his coat
and nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
damn, don't get me started
my mama smoked so god damn much
when she was pregnant i'm surprised i ain't retarded
at night i can't sleep, count sheep
as they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
staring at the wall, heard a scream
wake up in the mornin'
see the blood in the hall from the murder scene
don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
as i take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
on the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
and the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(five-zero) i daydream about the dope world
take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
my mossberg goes boom, what's another plug
snatching drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
(give it up nigga) don't run out of breath
every step could be death 'til you blast
and be the last nigga left, then i'll be ghost

don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
as i take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
<i>[twox]</i>

a seven-deuce full of niggas goes by
thought i was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep
let me die as i rest in peace, deep
back to these niggas in the seven-deuce
a mac-ten out the window bout to let it loose, what could i do
run for cover and return fire
die motherfuckin die, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
but i let off everything i have
an empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
on my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
barely breathing trying to keep from getting shot down
boo-yaow is the sound, bullet whizzed by
still running like a nigga got nine lives
don't know why but i'm running to my fucking block
took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops
time to be a ghost
(hey man, come the fuck on)
and then we'll be ghost

don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
as i take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby

fuck the police nigga!


<i>[twopac:]</i>
sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning
mind full of demons, i don't wanna hear 'em anymore
got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
'cause they seeing destruction before they see a human being
so they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape 
'cause they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
before we learn to fly? somebody else should try
cockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change
so i'm told, but i haven't seen a change unfold
i'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe
communities in need of people that will lead
keep your eyes open, i can only say i'll try
until the day i die, i promise to be wise
with my heart open, greed brings only misery
away the tragedy, so i stay sucker free
only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
for the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise
stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies

<i>[eminem:]</i>
we can only learn to take, our anger and our hate
control our mental states, settle down and set it straight
maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate
'cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take
and there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
to the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes
you think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes
but we ain't, its grain to go against
with every artist comes the image he portrays
and the picture that he paints
but in the midst of all this anger and this angst
never once did you heard me say i'm a gangster
and i ain't hear no complaints
but i know that i will always continue to grow
as long as i lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow
there will never be another me, and that i can guarantee
that's why the fuck i remain sucker free
to this day, the game will never be the same
no matter how much fame and success they attain
there will never be another me
and no matter what they do, there will never be another you
you can search, but you'll never find
you can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
we will never die, we are forever alive

<i>[twopac:]</i> and we continue growin', one day at a time

<i>[young noble:]</i>
don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
rappers are regular people minus money and lights
searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom
all the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest
there's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'
and the kids think beef is they only option
outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged
my memories took a dive, my machiavelli lives on
you think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns
and when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
so if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?
we needing a change, the drama remains the same

<i>[hussein fatal:]</i>
i spend my whole life fightin' myself
that i can't win, so i'm invitin' some help
and hey, now then, i take rights and no lefts
i'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt
yeah, that there is a fight in itself
so i just pray and hope god, take a light to myself
no matter how much i try, stay alive
i'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride

<i>[e.d.i. mean:]</i>
heard frivolous beats, we past that
i'm tryin' to keep some income coming in
and collect on my ascap
the rappers in the game ain't changed
and i finally realize that we're not in the same game
the hatin' will never end, so i guess i'll deal with it
them .forty-five's will pop killas, yes, i'm still with it
the streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers
they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
so we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
one way at a time, keep the faith in your mind

<i>[twopac:]</i> and we continue growin', one day at a time, damn


<i>[twopac (?):]</i>
between you and biggie it was like, who's going to rule the
nigga kingdom and shit, basically, know what i'm saying?
i was like, this is like a fucking election
it is that
(you know what i am saying)
me and biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's likeâ¦

and i wonder if they'll laugh when i'm dead?
why am i fighting to live if i'm just living to fight?
(you don't know)
why am i trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
why am i trying to give when no one gives me a try?
why am i dying to live if i'm just living to die?

<i>[the notorious b.i.g.:]</i>
check it, i grew up a fuckin' screw-up
got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
choppin' rocks overnight. the nigga biggie smalls trying to turn into the black frank white
we had to grow dreads to change our description
two cops is on the milk box missin'
show they toes, you know they got stepped on
a fistful of bullets, a chest full of teflon
runnin' from the police, picture that
nigga, i'm too fat, i fuck around and catch a asthma attack
that's why i bust back, it don't phase me
when he drop, take his glock, and i'm swayze
celebrate my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
lay back, i got some money to make, motherfucker

and i wonder if they'll laugh when i'm dead?
why am i fighting to live if i'm just living to fight?
why am i trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
why am i trying to give when no one gives me a try?
why am i dying to live if i'm just living to die?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
(it's on me), but still i'm having memories
of high speed when the cops crashed
as i laugh, pushing the gas while my glocks blast
we was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
in the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
many dreams is what i had, and plenty wishes
no hesitation in extermination of these snitches
envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
a couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna to screw me
even the cops tried to sue me, so what can i do?
but stay true, sippin' twenty-two's of brew
and now media is trying to test me
got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
misery is all i see, that's my mind state
my history with the police will shake the crime rate
my main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
he screamed "thug life!" and emptied the clip
got tired of runnin' from the police

and i wonder if they'll laugh when i'm dead?
why am i fighting to live if i'm just living to fight?
why am i trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
why am i trying to give when no one gives me a try?
why am i dying to live if i'm just living to die?

<i>[twopac:]</i>
they wanted a new regime. and my regime includes east coast, includes west coast

<i>[the notorious b.i.g.:]</i>
i was more shocked than anything, you know what i'm saying?
but i wasn't more shocked of him dying
i was more shocked of him... pac is a strong dude, yo
i know dude, you know what i'm saying? real strong
so when they was like he got shot, i was just more like, "again?" you know what i'm sayin'?
he always getting shot, or shot at
he going to pull through this one again
make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
you know what i'm saying? but when he, when he died
i was just like, "whoa", you know what i'm saying?
kinda took me by
i mean even though we was going through our drama
i would never wish death on nobody, you know what i'm sayin'
because there ain't no coming back from that


<i>[twopac:]</i>
staring at the world through my rearview
just looking back at the world from another level
ya know what i mean? starin'â¦

<i>[twopac:]</i>
multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
niggas is calling cops, people shot, nobody stops
i wonder when the world stopped caring
last night two kids shot while the whole block staring
i will never understand this society
first they try to murder me then they lie to me
product of a dying breed
all my homies trying weed
now the little baby's crazed raised off hennessy
tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
listen, through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
and we turning bad boys to grown men, it's on again
i give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
one love from a thug nigga
rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
to the end, my friend
i'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
while i'm staring at the world through my rearview
see, i'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
while i'm staring at the world through my rearview
they got me

<i>[twopac:]</i>
staring at the world through my rearview
go on, baby, scream to god, he can't hear you
i can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
getting high, watching time fly
and all my motherfuckers

<i>[e.d.i. mean:]</i>
now you see him, now you don't
some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
what happened to 'em?
well, let's see, it seems to be a mystery
but all i know i never let the money get to me
stay down like the truest
thug life until i check out this bitch, i thought you knew this
who is gonna catch me when i fall or even care to?
while you thinking i see you lost up in my rearview
hear you is down with them outlawz
outcast, left far, i'm through like southpaws
but still we keep mashing till our dreams come through
staring at the world through my rearview

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now i was raised as a young black male
in order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
in the cell, counting days in this living black hell
do you feel me? keys to ignition, use at your discretion
roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
niggas hate me in the section from years of chin-checking
turn to smith and wesson war weapons
heavenly father, i'm a soldier
i'm getting hotter cause the world's getting colder
baby, let me hold ya
talk to my guns like they fly bitches
all you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now i know the answers to the question
"do dreams come true?"
still staring at the world through my rearview
i said now i know the answers, "do dreams come true?"
staring at the world through my rearview

nigga kadafi say..

<i>[kadafi:]</i>
back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
nine-six for glocks
cause fiends hitting up blocks with street sweepers
bless myself when knowing rules to these streets
something i learned in school
on some million man march shit for the piece/peace
true that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
criminally addicted, infested since a seed
we all die, breed bleed like humans
towns run by young guns, outlawz and truants
shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when i go
burnt my body with my shotty, or chosing my dough
so while you reminiscing all nights out with the crew
smoke a blunt for me too, i'm staring through your rearview

<i>[twopac:]</i>
hahahaha, you ain't knowing what we mean by staring through the rearview, so since you ain't knowing what we mean let me break down understanding
the worldâ¦ the world is behind us
once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
and what the levels and the rules of the game is, then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played
so now we looking at the world, from like, behind us
niggas know what we gotta do
just gotta put our mind to it and do it
it's all about the papers, money rule the world
bitches make the world go round
real niggas do they wanna do, bitch niggas do what they can

<i>[twopac:]</i>
staring at the world through my rearview
go on, baby, scream to god, he can't hear you
i can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
getting high, watching time fly
and all my motherfuckers

all around the world, same song
all all around the world same song
<i>[twox]</i>

<i>[shock g:]</i>
i came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on
eat popcorn, watch you move your body to the pop song
that i'm singing, dinga-linging, funky beats ringing
everybody's swinging in the place
as i kick the j-a-z-z-y style
r&amp;b mixing it with the hip hop swing beat
champagne in my hand, it won't be long till i'm gone
it's just the same old song

<i>[humpty hump:]</i>
it's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kicking
sweat dripping, girlies in the limo eating chicken
oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose
i love ya rover, move over, i gotta blow my nose
sneezing, but still i'm pleasing to all the slimmies
pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a jenny
if it's good and plenty, don't you know
there i go, there i go, there i go
but i don't go nowhere without my jim hat
if i'm rapping, cause she's clapping
then i'm strapping cause i'm smarter than that
then girlie maybe we can get along
cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song

all around the world, same song
all all around the world same song
<i>[threex]</i>

<i>[money b:]</i>
money b, the freaky deaky, the sqeaky meaky up and down
as a matter of fact ill be right back i gotta take a leak
so i'm draining entertaining, but i got fame
and the bases i touch too much for me trying to be naming
aiyyo, you saw me on cable and grinned
i busted in and i was gone with the wind
clark gable back in oakland its the same old song
sport these shorties, same freckles and hat
drinking the same fortys

<i>[humpty hump:]</i>
hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip
just like butter, my rhymes are legit
cause i'm the humpty. not humpty dumpty, but humpty hump
here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a hump

<i>[shock g:]</i>
ah shut up and just listen
not dissing don't get me wrong

so just watch, my name is shock, and i like to rock
and you can't stop this
twopac go ahead and rock this

<i>[twopac:]</i>
now i clown around when i hang around with the underground
girls used to frown, say i'm down, when i come around
gas me and when they pass me they use to diss me
harass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high
same song, can't go wrong, if i play the nice guy
(claimin' fame, must have changed, now that we became strong)
i remain, still the same (why tu'?) cause it's the same song

all around the world, same song
all all around the world same song

as real as it seems the american dream
ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
to get us locked up shot up back in chains
to deny us of the future rob our names
kept my history of mystery but now i see
the american dream wasn't meant for me
cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
promised me freedom, education, equality
never gave me nothing but slavery
and now look at how dangerous you made me
calling me a mad man cause i'm strong and bold
with this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
promised me emancipation in this new nation
all you ever gave my people was starvation
fathers of our country never cared for me
they kept my ancestors shackled up in slavery
and uncle sam never did a damn thing for me
except lie about the facts in my history
so now i'm sitting here mad cause i'm unemployed
but the government's glad cause they enjoyed
when my people are down so they can screw us around
time to change the government now panther power

panther power

<i>[ray luv:]</i>
coming straight that resides within
go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
the rich get richer and the poor take less
the american dream was an american nightmare
you kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
the klu klux klan tried to keep us out
besides drew they know no blacks allowed
with intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
but now were impatient
blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs
freedom, equality, then i'll yell out
"don't you ever be ashamed of what you are
it's ya panther power that makes you a star"
panther power

panther power

<i>[twopac:]</i>
my mother never let me forget my history
hoping i was set free chains never put on me
wanted to be more than just free
had to know the true facts about my history
i couldn't settle for being a statistic
couldn't survive in this capitalistic
government cause it was meant to hold us back
using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack
in my community, they killed the unity
but when i charged them, tried to claim immunity
i strike america like a case of heart disease
panther power is running through my arteries
try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
cause i'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
do you remember that is what i'm asking you?
you think you living free don't let me laugh at you
open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
'cause some time has passed seem you all forget
there ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet

i would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks
but no
i'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block
little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks
and i'm totin' these thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked
and niggas laugh, til' tha first mothafucka got blasted
i put the nigga in his casket
now they coverin' the bastard in plastic
i smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts
i'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce
and gettin' lost on the five-o, fuck them hoes
got a forty-five screamin' about survival
hey nigga can i lay low, cook some yay-yo
hollar "one-time" when i say so
don't want to go to the pen, i'm hittin' fences
narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches
and they say how do you survive weighin' one hundred and sixty-five
in a city where the skinny niggas die?
tell mama don't cry
even when they kill me
they can never take the game from a young g
i'm streight ballin'
streight ballin'
still on parole and i'm the first nigga servin'
pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it
but if i want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'
it's kinda boomin' and today i'll make a killin'
dressin' down like a villain, but only on the block
it's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops
ha, i'm gettin' high. i think i'll die if i don't get no ends
i'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a benz
i hate to stip let my music bump
drinkin' liquor, and i'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck
rather die makin' money than live poor and legal
as i slang another ounce, i wish it was a kilo
a need money in a major way
time to fuck my beeeyatchhey!, and getten' paid
you other mothafuckas callin'
but me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas
we streight ballin'
streight ballin'
damned if i don't, and damned if a nigga do
so watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to raise up
but don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes
young nigga time to do or die
i keep a pistol in my pocket
ready on my block
ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
and now they see that mothafucka beat pain
at point blank range cause he slept on the game
ain't a damned thing changed
shakin' the dice, now roll 'em
if you can't stand pain better hold 'em
cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll
you might go catch aids from a slight cold. nigga
better live your life to the fullest
you 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol mothafucka better pull it
cause even when they kill me
they can never take the game from a young g
we streight ballin'
we streight ballin'
to my niggas in the penitentiary
loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me
cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born
and once again it's on
i'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone
who the hell can you get to stop me?
i'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse
i keep my glock cocked
i need it cause they're all shady
i finally made it
now these jealous bitches tryin' to fade me
i ain't goin' out i'd rather blast back
i'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack
and i came up a long way from food stamps
and takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps
could you blame me if they sweat me i'm gonna open fire
what could i do? pull my trigga or watch my nigga die
i'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs
i'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs
and mothafucka, we be ballin'
all mothafuckin' day long, stay strong
we streight ballin'

i can make a million and still not get enough of spending
and since my life is based on sinning, i'm hell-bound
rather be buried than be worried, living held down
my game plan to be trained and, military
mind of a thug lord, sitting in the cemetery
caught, i've been lost since my adolescence, calling to jesus
balling as a youngster, wondering if he sees us
young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's bitching
please god can you understand me, bless my family

i was playing with guns
while your momma had your punk ass playing tennis

wake up, turn on your tv and see my ass again

those who wish to follow me
(my ghetto gospel)
i welcome with my hands
and the red sun sinks at last
into the hills of gold
and peace to this young warrior
without the sound of guns

<i>[twopac]</i>
if i could recollect before my hood days
i sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
i stop and stare at the younger
my heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
and nowadays things change
everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
and for me it's reversed
we left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
'cause any day they'll push the button, and all good men
like malcolm x or bobby hutton died for nothin'
don't it make you get teary? the world looks dreary
when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
there's no need for you to fear me
if you take your time and hear me
maybe you can learn to cheer me
it ain't about black or white, 'cause we human
i hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel

livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
and over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
i don't trip or let it fade me
from out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
even now i get discouraged
wonder if they take it all back, will i still keep the courage?
i refuse to be a role model
i set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
i make mistakes but learn from every one
and when it's said and done
i bet this brother be a better one
if i upset you don't stress, never forget
that god isn't finished with me yet
i feel his hand on my brain
when i write rhymes i go blind and let the lord do his thang
but am i less holy 'cause i chose to puff a blunt
and drink a beer with my homies?
before we find world peace, we gotta find peace and end the war in the streets; my ghetto gospel

love's gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
you best to backtrack and try to act black and live
not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
what's the matter g? black cat got your tongue
fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (do ya feel me?)
dum dum diddy is it me?
attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
if not peace then at least let's get a piece
i'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
lookin' through my highschool yearbook
reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
one homie, two homie, three homies - poof
we used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
god come save the misbegotten
lost ghetto souls of black cotton (in god's eyes)

nobody don't care
(no matter how hard i try, look to the sky, and i ask god why)
nobody don't care
(seems like my dreams, drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
nobody don't care

nobody don't care
(seems like my prayers vanish to thin air, please answer my questions)

<i>[kastro:]</i>
in the belly of the beast i'm bubbling up
running out of luck, about to self destruct
old heads say live your life like such
you're sure to catch her witcha one day boy
i wouldn't listen to 'em
your power movement was cool
but it ain't fix nothin'
so i just go with what i know
i don't trust none
look what the eightys did
to us baby kids
and now we grown up
nobody ain't own us yet

<i>[young noble:]</i>
black cotton, i'm plottin' on what they owe me
i'm workin' without a profit
they shacklin' all my homies
i'm hurtin' but keep the mind
and we ain't stop, it's curtains, you try to rise and
certainly we survive with outlaw ridas
what's the reward for a struggler
if the lord loving us then why they hate to see us comin' up
running up, gun cocked, black mask and gloves
if you ain't got a penny, mind the glove
no love
waitin' for my forty acres and a blunt to blaze
biblical times good hearts with milita minds
black cotton - i'm hoppin' over enemy lines
black cotton - i ain't stoppin' till they giving me mine
black cotton

life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
i got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasing me around
and it's always drama, whenever i wanna get around
momma told me, long before i ever came up
gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up
'cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor
best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
i'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
and i got no time to worry, i'm steady wanting more
every day is a test, yes, i try hard
but i'm strugglin' with every breath, i pray to god
that the woman that i left at home, all alone
there ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone
in my mind i can see her naked, i can't take it
got me shaking at the thought that we can make it
i thought you knew

<i>[nate dogg:]</i>
i'm rollin' out on tour today
you getting sad, 'cause i'm going away
the chickenheads wanna play with me
you getting mad, 'cause you think i'ma sway
some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
i hear 'em scream soon as i hit the stage, nah...
still i be getting lonely for you
i'm coming home soon as i make this pay, make this pay

<i>[twopac:]</i>
i call you up long distance, on the telephone
wanna tuck you in even though i can't make it home
i whisper things in your ear like you're near me
wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
it seems to me, that you're jealous
'cause i'm hustling and making money with the fellas
in the back streets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!
thugs get lonely too, but i'm a soldier
and there's no way i'ma stop making money
'cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny
always complaining, saying we don't spend time
can't you see i got enough stress on my mind?
and hanging up like you all that
then get mad when i tell you that i'm busy, baby, call back
please, ain't nothing left to say to you
thugs get lonely too, you know

<i>[nate dogg:]</i>

talking out loud to you, like you're there
take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
you're the first face i wanna see when i get home
wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
touching every wall in the house, thug style
put your hands on the headboard, think of me
drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
this in your head that i'm making love, so turn the lights down
reminisce and relax 'cause, baby, right now
i feel it in the middle of my stomach
you whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it
hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
'cause everything i'm giving to you, is so true
and thugs get lonely too, you know

"niggas!" yeah... uh...
"niggas!"

<i>[twopac:]</i>
who's afraid of the punk police?
niggas run the streets, no justice no peace
fuck the law, i'd rather draw than do time
don't fuck with mine 'cross the line
my two nines go biya biya when i shoot 'em
korean motherfuckers was crooked
so niggas had to burn and loot 'em
now the streets ain't safe at night, my niggas
...uh, straight take his life
so don't sleep when my team creep up, how we hit 'em
empty the clip, then dip cause we did 'em
licking off shots for latasha, that's proper
love for my niggas but a glock for the coppers
so what the fuck you wanna do now?
i packed a nine last year, in 'ninety-nine i'm packing two now
and even if they pull they triggers
they can shoot one man, but nothing's gonna stop the plan of true niggas

"niggas!" yeah, niggas - can't fuck with us
"niggas!" yeah, niggas
cause being a nigga means you love niggas, ha-ha
"niggas!" i was raised in this society so there's no way you can
expect me to be a perfect person, cause i'mma do what i'mma do

<i>[jadakiss:]</i> ha! uh.
aiyyo!

<i>[jadakiss:]</i>
my dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em bedrocks
niggas is like photographers, all they take is head shots
your last words'll be, damn, what's all these red dots?
niggas nowadays they worry me
my bars is therapy, as long as you using 'em thoroughly
muah 'til the day that they bury me
my niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably ever be
and i'm a product of the seventys
the hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
if i ain't eating wit'chu i'm probably beefin wit'chu
if no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speaking wit'chu
i know you got a gun but i'm hoping you keep it wit'chu
cause unfortunately i'm one of the rappers that keep a pistol and
know what the llama do, shady/aftermath
ruff ryders, d block, and of course amaru
lot of people honor you, probably cause the way
that you used to bring the drama to, whoever you wanted to
you a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
but, anyway, life goes on
so i'll see you when i art in heaven like our fathers do

"niggas!" yeah, niggas - can't fuck with us
"niggas!" yeah, niggas
cause being a nigga means you love niggas, ha-ha
"niggas!" i was raised in this society so there's no way you can
expect me to be a perfect person, cause i'mma do what i'mma do

soon as i come home it's like i get the third degree
where you been and who you with, i get no room to breathe
it makes me wanna leave, i'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
your suspicious i deceive, gimme grief when poppa leave
but to me, if you really trust me then it's pitiful
question me about my whereabouts, that's so trivial
let me live my life and you can live yours
just be there to help me and support me that's what you're here for
not to give me stress and add to pressure
home is where i go to rest, i go to pass the test
i'm sorry if i left you all alone

tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
it's time for us to take our separate paths
we had a lot of laughs but the good's become the past
let's make it an even break, don't make it scandalous
try and be mature, i'm pretty sure that we can handle this
you're saying i'm too busy, i ignore you
i guess you didn't hear me when i said that i cared for you
but now it seems the arguments are nightly
i wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
so why let it stress and aggravate me
instead i'd rather break, hope you don't hate me
you tell me that you love me but you're lying
fighting back the urge to just start crying
i'll wipe away your tears, come and hug me
i love you like you love me, girl, but don't you trust me?

you always wanna sweat, how much closer can we get
don't fret, just let me pack my things and i'll be outtie
this time i'm breaking out, you let your mouth overcrowd me
i can't take the beefin and the griefin
i get no room to sleep, i hope to see some cause i'm leaving
maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
and i can give you more when you mature
but, baby, until then i gotta leave ya
it's not that i don't need ya but see ya
and i hope you understand why i'm busting
not because we bust our love, hah, don't you trust me?

i think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
now, it's getting crazy after dark, these narc's
be like trying to shut me down but i'm too smart
now picture me scared of the penitentiary
i've been moving these things since the days of elementary
now tell me what you need when you see me
i'm stacking g's, buying all the things on tv, believe me
i got some killers on my payroll, and they know
when it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
although i'm young, i'm still coming up
i'm getting paid, pulling razors on niggas when they running up
the first to pull a strap when there's drama - busta you ain't heard?
i've been slicing motherfuckers since i lost my mama
there ain't a cop that can stop me
my posse is cocky, and they don't quit until they drop me
i'm loyal to the game

"prince of peace must hear our plea"
"told life you'd be back" "there you were"
"prince of peace must hear our plea"
"everybody look around" "there is no hope"
"prince of peace must hear our plea"
"brothers we better get hip"

<i>[big syke:]</i>
my mama say i'm crazy cause i'm all about the hood
i can't get my shit together but i'm on leather and wood
and the hood is all i know, patrol and circle the block
off the curb and niggas swerve, serve a smoker a rock
and i'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my caddy
and i'm steady catching static, move the traffic to the alley
out in cali niggas rally others all for the soil
mix the work with baking soda and get the water to boil
oh no can't no busters hang, i hope you feel me mayne
cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
my niggas feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
you know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
and it's a shame i see the mark in they eyes
when they yelling that he telling get to me, no surprise, nigga

"prince of peace must hear our plea"
"told life you'd be back" "there you were"
"prince of peace must hear our plea"
"everybody look around" "there is no hope"
"prince of peace must hear our plea"
"brothers we better get hip"

"and come off this trip"

<i>[dj quik:]</i>
loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
i, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
the superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
enemies in my family extorting scheming and scamming me (pop pop)
i'm like bruce nolan, i'm rollin' until the diesel hit me
i'm battered and bruised, and madder having to choose
'tween happiness and the blues, and who be filling my shoes
when i done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
but panic when i be smooth, i'm manic but i'm no fool
y'all rapping i'm talking cool, and columbine is not new
in compton they shoot up schools too, riding by to see who's who
cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
tell his family that dude's blue, no coming back
from him scrapping when niggas was packing and he wasn't packing too
so if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
i seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em

"prince of peace must hear our plea"
"told life you'd be back" "there you were"
"prince of peace must hear our plea"
"everybody look around" "there is no hope"
"prince of peace must hear our plea"

"thugs throw like wine down a nigga's throat
if this shit don't stop stop stop stop stop!"

walking dead, angel spend they last days by me
new jersey giant, like dave tyree
young george and jonathan jatt
your guns clap, mine'll go brraaatt, soldier like geronimo pratt
and come through cockin' the black pound
when they put the twin towers up
pac, i'm knockin' them back down
poster child cheque, air force ones
with the crooked dial checks, i'm supposed to wild sex
money and murder is all i breathe in my life
it's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
through the henny i see the eyes of the devil
g ridin' with extra boxes of bullets to the nine and the shovel

<i>[carl thomas:]</i>
who you are
one nation under a thug and bullet scar
young nation, no revolution and no cause
one nation, young black and dangerous by far
young nation just tryin' to get this

<i>[papoose:]</i> 
i always thought i'd have to die to do a record with pac
so i wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
you end up in a box, 'cause them graverobbin' bastards
dig your grave back up, snatched you out the casket
worms in my eyes, eatin' through my cabbage
the flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
but i'm not dead, i'm actually in a session
with the pac keepin' the shot money, progressive
they don't really want no drama, i know you're goons
that's why i keep pressure on them, like a open wound
this god-given, he keep givin' me better music
so every time you hear me, my songs present improvement
y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin'
songs are evolution
if i load your gun for you and we bang it out at some other niggas, you better shoot it
don't try to lie and say you was bustin'âi'm clever, stupid!
claimin' you reppin' ruthless
you got the same bullets that you had
when i loaded it for you, you never used it
the nacirema dream get ready for execution
papoose, fatal and pacâthe revolution

<i>[carl thomas:]</i>
who you are
one nation under a thug and bullet scar
young nation, no revolution and no cause
one nation, young black and dangerous by far
young nation just tryin' to get this

another shady mission
tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision

blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
if i have kids, will i live to see them grow?
though i don't know
i live the life of a thug nigga until the day i go
no broken promises, a sacred bond broken
i know i die alone, but yet and still i'm hopin'
visions of prisons, maybe i'll be forgiven
i know it's better in heaven, 'cause being here ain't livin'
close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy
still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
maybe i'll be the one or just maybe i'm lost

watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation 
separation is self destruction 
what's needed is unification 
cause the world ain't hardly scared 
if not prepared 
be sure to be bummy and be no longer there 
but no one cares it's there to share 
all we get is stares 
because of fear we'll evaporate 
say your prayers

deliver the bomb shit from the east to west

personally i ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff
i'm takin' back my money counter 'cause it wasn't fast enough, yep
i got a couple problems (word) and none of 'em is money
just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies
sometimes i want to maneuver with the ruger

in meetings they always askin' what my passion is

dear baby, it's me again, stuck inside this max pen
tryna pay my debt for all my sins
see, these penitentiary times be so heavy on my mind
at times it's like i'm living just to die
i'm living in hell, stuck in my jail cell
stranded in the county jail, waiting for my chance to post bail
i wanna be paid in large stacks and mash in fast jags
i blast and wonder "how long will i last?"
my memories fade when i'm intoxicated
busters are shady, so i'm dumping on cowards
crazy whenever faded
i know i said it all before, but now i mean it
visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear i seen it
even though you mad at me
you'll be glad to see the strategy
of making these chips come so easily
i max out in the morning, baby, life is good
me and you against the whole hood, soon as i get home

<i>[twopac:]</i>
grab my straps, locate my comrades

sittin' here looking at pictures of me and you livin'
but now you out in the world, while i'm twistin' in prison
love letters come daily, words of affection
you send me money and nude pictures beggin' for some sexin'
stay wide open, keep your eyes peeled
and my advice is "keep it real or you can die squealin'."
plus i never had to worry 'bout a visit
âcause you're there daily
guards tryna get your number, you don't dare tell me
tongue-kissing, steady humpin', tryna touch up somethin'
before the c-o in the corner jump in, frontin'
late night reminiscing, everybody's quiet
i think something's in the air, prepare for the riot
it's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs
i touch 'em with thug love and then let they heads ring
i started a war, but now i'm gone
release me to the streets in the morning
it's on, soon as i get home

<i>[twopac:]</i>
grab my gats, locate my comrades

and me and mama surviving
depends on how many rocks a nigga cook up
narcotics got traffic, seen those niggas you blasted
wanting me in a casket, on a ground, kind of plastic
yeah, nigga, i heard, lil' mu gave the word
you get paroled on the third, it's all love
we out here frontin', still here but all about nothin'
but double o's is what i'm wantin'
and i'm tryna see somethin' that we ain't never had
luxury life, results living bad
tricks of the trade, shit that should've been taught by dad
but learned through the crew
lessons between me and you
and once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do
meanwhile i stay waiting by the phone
hoping i'll get a call telling a nigga that you home

<i>[twopac:]</i>

hit the charts like a madman nothin' but hits
court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
dodging cop cars look at how we come so far
picture high school dropout rollin' the double r
house full of happiness weed and drink
way out sortin' trouble tryna find me king
never pictured livin' longer than my twenty-first
thought i'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
and though it hurts to see the change
it comes with the fame
why we gossip in the silly games
to all the motherfuckers speaking down on me -
this is the night, why is everybody caught up in pac's life
to all ya'll niggas, conversatin' on my life
mind your motherfuckin' business!

<i>[snoop dogg:]</i>

but what do you know about pac's life? (what you know about pac's life?) yeah
everybody talk about pac's life (outlaw, outlaw, yeah)

<i>[snoop dogg:]</i>
when we first hung out together, i met you with the homie
we had no intentions of becoming homies
but at no time at all, you became my dog
you showed me how to roll blunts, we used to bounce and ball
i was living on wilshire in the penthouse suites
had my lil' cousin daz hook you up with some beats
it was outlaw, dogg pound, death row records, man we tore up the town
snoop dogg and dr. dre and now we got pac, it felt like a drizzeam
remember when i told suge to put you on the tizzeam
and you know that i was true
cause i took the focus off of me to put 'all eyez on you'
and we became the most hunted together, 'two of amerikaz most wanted'
and our relationship was genuine

talkin' loud outta pocket tryna bang wit' me
well so i'm pullin' out my pocket, let it rain ya' see
now they all in the court room, blamin' me
see we lived the same life and represent the same struggle
power to the real nigga and death to the sucker

visions of over packed prisons, millions of niggas thug living
pressure's, three strikes i hope they don't test us

i'm sensing niggas is defenseless i'm hitting fences then getting ghost
who can prevent me shooting senseless at these nigga's throats?
only wish to breed, i explode into a million seeds 
y'all remember me legendary live eternally
bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
niggas screamin' peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em
take 'em to places face to face then erase 'em, and break 'em
murder motherfuckers that are waitin' to quicken the pace

the homie 'pac told me, "i can guarantee you a boss."

since he disappeared, i still ain't found peace in it
but still struggling like mumia abu, it was 'bout to end truly i knew

<i>[verse one:]</i>
late night coolin' with my homies
drinkin' hennessey an' cold brew
after smokin' stopped in oakland
got the munchies for some soul food
so we stopped to get a bite to eat
at the local barbeque
it's just another borin' monday
an' there's nothin' else to do
now as we stepped out of the car i
heard someone behind me fighting
so i turned to look and find out
what's the cause of this excitement
one brother was a dopefiend
and the other was a dopeman
and the dopeman had a ak
said he'll spray an' he's not jokin'
well it seems to be the dopefiend
owed the dopeman for his product
and he swore if he did not pay
he would end up gettin' shot up
now i could not walk away
'cause i got caught up in the scene
wonderin' what would happen
to this poor and helpless fiend
well my homie michael cooley
said let's go and make our order
what's the use in watchin' two men
stand out here fight over quarters
well i walked inside the diner
and all the dopefiends waved to me
heard the sound of several gunshots
and i ran outside to see

<i>[verse two:]</i>
all the people in the diner
ran outside to see the big show
it was just another party
for them to see just who they would know
but for me i held concern
i wanted to go see the outcome
would a mother have a son tonight
or would she live her life without one
i made it to the streets i
almost cried right on the spot
not only had the fiend died
but a small girl had been shot
my heart could take no more
i felt a tear roll down my face
that was daddy's bullet
but she took it in his place

<i>[verse three:]</i>
tried to make way through the crowd
so i could go help the baby
she could barely speak but she whispered
"mister can you please save me? "
so i screamed out "someone help me! "
but i don't think they could hear
and if they did they didn't care
oh how i hated everyone there
the baby lie here dyin'
and i wondered what could i do
the cameraman and newspapers
had come to get their interviews
to them it's just story
and they can't see the tragedy
to them it doesn't matter
'cause hey it wasn't their family
i don't think i'll be back
'cause it'll never be the same here
so i wipe away the tears
and leave the scene the way i came here
though some people say it's crazy
and the food could have been finer
i'll never forget
never forget the night at dopefiend's diner

<i>[verse one: twopac]</i>
so mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
so you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
we must be patient nothing better than communication
known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
sorry i left that ass waiting
no more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shaking
i'm busting and making motherfuckers panic
don't take your life for granted put that ass in the dirt
you swear the bitch was planted
my lyrics motivate the planet
it's similar to rhythm nation
but thugged out, forgive me janet
who's in control i'm activating your souls
you know, the way the games get controlled
you, two years ago, a friend of mine

the last of the last dying breed ballin with me

<i>[verse three: young noble]</i>

<i>[verse four: kurupt]</i>

from kansas to staten island
i shot the monkey on my back
and its back in the guiness book of world records
i'm in this
the most hated but most loved menace from here to venice
the grinch came to steal your money and your better day
christmas and your little spinach got eaten
smoke smoke smoking away all day
any way that you say it nigga just break me off half
many years ago,
a friend of mine taught me everything about the game
gave me a nine
so i went straight to the block
started my grind

<i>[chorus]</i>

when in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin trap shut

i think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
it's gettin crazy after dark,
these narcs be like trying to shut me down but i'm too smart
now picture me scared of the penitentiary
i've been moving these things since the days of elementary
now tell me what ya need when ya see me
i'm stacking gs buying all the things on tv, believe me
i got some killers on my payroll and they know
when it's time to handle business nigga lay low
although i'm young i'm still coming up
i'm gettin paid pulling razors on niggas when they running up
the first to pull the strap when there's drama
buster you ain't heard?i been slicing motherfuckers since i lost my mama
there ain't a cop that can stop me
my posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me
i'm loyal to the game

<i>[chorus]</i>
if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn

a nigga never been as broke as me, i like that
when i was young i had two pair of lees, besides that
the pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
the one i wore on mondays and wednesdays
while niggas flirt, i'm sewing tigers on my shirtand alligators
ya wanna see the inside, huh, i see ya later
here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga wit the fake, blaow!
why you punch me in my face, stay in ya place
play ya position, here come my intuition
go in this nigga pocket
rob him while his friends watchin
that hoes clockin, here comes respect
his crew's your crew, or they might be next
look at they man eye, big man they never try
so we roll wid em, stole wid em
i mean loyalty, niggaz bought me milks at lunch
the milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch.

if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song

if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song

if i die young

it's the last days, niggas is dyin' for bullshit
mac-eleven is heavy yet i'm ready to pull quick
niggas ain't ready for a brother that's livin' major
bear witness to a sick motherfucker that's spittin' razors
when i cut 'em they cut, when i stick 'em they stuck
my ambitions to bust, 'cause i ain't givin' a fuck
we tore the neighborhood up, look at all the shit that we did
murder's a life long bitch
if my enemies love they kids

and i don't wanna kill ya
keep my name out ya mouth
'fore a nigga have to drill ya
all my enemies buggin' for all the shit that they did
don't make me murder you nigga
if my enemy's love their kids

body's is wrapped in plastic
look at this, it's drastic
just takes a nigga with the right automatic to cause static
like a mossberg dumpin', and muthafucker do jumpin'
make 'em role of a bitch
like michael jackson, "wanna be startin' somethin'"
holla at my crew and they perish you through the cherish
got that ass in my sight
tonight i'm bussin' off the terrace with multiple gun shots
niggas is droppin' rapidly, bussin' clip to cops
them bitches is runnin' after me, tellin' i'm high
when they ask why i'm trippin'
out top of my drop, 'cause you know why, keep dippin'
on my block they sell rocks and box with frail cops
and then we buss shots from glocks, fuck cops
my only fear of death, can you hear me, it's comin' back
had enough of this bullshit world so none of that
i felt no remorse for all the shit that we did
niggas dyin' in, hear the sirens
if my enemy's love their kids

you don't wanna die
and i don't wanna kill ya
keep my name out ya mouth
'fore a nigga have to drill ya
all my enemies buggin' for all the shit that they did
don't make me murder you nigga
if my enemy's love their kids

muthafuckin' right

<i>[napoleon:]</i>

but at the same time they rappin'
won't put my gun on the shelf
it keeps me livin' like heaven
but when the shit jumps i'm ready
'cause i already knew

deep in my heart i think this shits bout to pop any moment
tryna do me like my parents but i'm a tougher opponent

<i>[kastro:]</i>

<i>[chorus xtwo]</i>

<i>[chorus xtwo]</i>

<i>[verse four:]</i>

my life is hectic my homies send mail from jail
niggaz in hell got some horrible stories to tell
i'm catchin cases and still tryin to stack a grip
the irs is tryin to stress off a niggaz shit
a young nigga never had a prayer to prevail
and all my peers doin years locked up in jail
what can i do, stay strapped, get a bigger crew
and creep around with them dogg pound niggaz too
and now we rich ain't no bitch than can touch us
and it's a trip, how we clown, when we fuck sluts
bust nuts then i cut, that's my new thang
and motherfuckers got on do-rags

<i>[chorus xtwo]</i>

can i get paid, can i get paid, can i motherfuckin get paid
nigga can work for his money all motherfuckin day and
still never see a piece of it, you understand me?
it's not about the nice guy
it's bout the hardworkin motherfuckin thug nigga
if you ain't a thug nigga, you ain't really doin nothin
<i>[chorus repeats in background]</i>
you ain't really makin nothin
these motherfuckin po-po's and these pink folks
got it all locked up for us to fail
see how they did o.j., and they doin niggaz like that all day
so if you don't watch your motherfuckin stack
believe me, this could be your last breath...

no survivors
any man the defies us
quickly dies
cause we ridahs
in my quest for chips
we wear vest
equipped with automatic fire

whispering while we conversatin'
cause niggaz died over information
how much more can we take?
expect us all to wait
the world ain't ready for us yet
so let's make clinton pay
(haha)
they never wanted us to make it
everything that we posses
we had to fight and take it
i think the president is smoking weed
bumpin' his beat
makin' a livin' out of my misery
till he got a friend like me

<i>[chorus xtwo]</i>

promise to visit
i know it's rough in your cell
receiving mail to the county jail
this is hell
when i was young
i could picture livin'
in luxury
so how the fuck did i end up in prison?
fuckin' snitches
they got me crossed by my own side
i found him by his self
no drama, he alone die
nobody cry
should have never testified
you got my nigga twenty-five
so now i sacrifice your life
help to separate me and my dog
broken ties
why the fuck should i let you live?
when i'm dead inside
rapid fire my delivery
i'm bustin' at their whole crew
nigga remember me
hit up my outlaw set
then throw my pistol in the ocean
ditch my ski mask
and get to straight coastin'
it's visitin' day at san quinton
always there to see your closest row dog
cause you ain't never had a friend like me

<i>[chorus xfour]</i>

<i>[small chorus: xtwo]</i>
come after us, best be complete
my enemies your enemies
cause you ain't never had a friend like me
nobody knows where we'll be
my enemies your enemies
cause you ain't never had a friend like me

you ain't never had a friend like me
<i>[till fade]</i>


<i>[voice sample from star trek v:]</i>
i couldn't help but notice your pain
(my pain?)
it runs deep
share it with me!

<i>[verse one: twopac]</i>
they'll never take me alive, i'm gettin' high with my four-five
cocked on these suckas, time to die
even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
i was a fool all through high school kickin' up dust
but now i'm labelled as a trouble maker who can you blame?
smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
so i'm hopeless rollin' down the freeway swervin, don't worry
i'm about to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry
maybe if they tried to understand me, what should i do?
i had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could i do
but be a thug
out slangin' with the homies
fuck hangin' with them phonies in the club
got my mind on danger
never been a stranger to homicide
my cities full of gang bangers and drive bys
why do we die at an early age
he was so young
but still a victim of the twelve gauge
my memories of a corpse
mind full of sick thoughts
and i ain't goin back to court
so fuck what you thought i'm drinkin' hennessey
runnin from my enemies will i live to be twenty-three
there's so much pain

<i>[verse two: stretch]</i>
years and years of that rough life
runnin crazed and wild as a kid and growin tough with a knife
and livin trifed on the regular
buckin out competitors
see a faker move and chase them down like the fuckin predator
get in trouble everyday in school
act a fool
and you know i had to break every rule
showin off for the bitches cause i had the mad rep
so i had to watch my back when it was time to step
but my <i>[?]</i> grimiest with love for me
pop, pop, pop
and send a sucka up above for me
aiyyo currency kept passing me by, but i didn't cry
broke and head off with the pack and started sellin coke
and now the money's looking lovely
pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
kick 'em the game
it's all the same
i kick it back yo
give 'em slack yo
and now they label me the mack yo
people check it
get disrespected if you front the the birdman
you heard man
catch a couple shots from the glock in my hand
damn! at least i'm realistic with my biscuit
you know you get your ass twisted so run for cover
me and my man got a plan kickin' major dust
so if your on nigga look for the gauge to bust
a lot of pressure with the street fame
it's a deep game
and my mama always cryin'
yo there's so much pain

<i>[chorus]</i>

ohhhh...
ohhhh...

<i>[verse three: twopac]</i>
they got me mobbin like i'm loc'ed
and ready to get my slug on
i load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
i ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
trust, i got my glock cocked playa if they press me
bust on motherfuckers with a - paaassion
better duck cause i ain't lookin when i'm - b-blaaastin
i'm a nut and drinkin hennessey and gettin' high
on the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die
tell me why? 'cause this stress is gettin' major
a buck-fifty across the face with my razor
what can i do but be a thug until i'm dead and gone
keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
these sorry bastards want to kill me in my sleep
but will they can i see
and everyday it just a struggle
steady thuggin' in the streets
and i'll be ballin' loc
don't let 'em make you worry
keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
i was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta,
word to mutha i'm touched
i'm kickin dust up
ready to bust
i'm on the scene steady muggin' mean
until they kill me
i'll be livin this life
i know you feel me
there's so much pain

ohhhhhh...

unorthodox tripping catch him on missions
styles twisted daily weak emcees trail me show me how telling me
smoke me instead of jailing me 
you know it ain't no fatal dog and "j" without felony at the telly they yelling me

and i'll let you live long enough to let you see your son die

<i>[kurupt of d.p.g.]</i>
it was a nice sunny day i was dipping through the hood

i'm kurupt.. the half-inch villian cold chilling
from the floor to the ceiling and illegal living civillians
so much cash is in the bundles 
been there and done done it everything you've done seen and ever wanted 
i'm kurupt..
piece me up a piece of the pie many try but many die in attempts to ride
who's the man with ten thousand plans got the grants and my my squad
we world wide homicidal klan 
so many strech their arms out to touch my loot but fuck em dog
beware of the owner cuz the owner will shoot
meet the dog in the worst way and a nigga like me's tight on my worst day 
i been rockin mics since the first day my eyes opened wide
and finally re-a-lized tell me baby would you ride for me.

<i>[repeat chorus two]</i>


my road to glory is filled with thorns
fluent thoughts from my brain and i train to remain strong
they said i couldn't do it
lock me in chains til i
my struggles closer to the pain of a trained killer
please believe that i'll never be shamed again
again i'll be the next heavyweight champion
call me crazy but no one can fade me
i'm the product of the projects
lost and crazy
throw your hands up mr. bruno, why?
big mike tyson 'bout to brutalize that ass tonight
no hesitation in front of the whole nation
i beat that ass so bad i probably violate probation
through demonstration as i strategize information
intend to kill so it's real like i'm catching cases
ha-ha

let the world know i plan to die
if i don't leave with what i came for i'll be denied

now, my first round is for the times that i spent in this cell
the second round is for the media and the lies they tell
my third round is for the pain that i felt inside
best recognize i won't be denied, when we ride

my first round is for the times that i spent in this cell
the second round is for the media and the lies they tell
my third round is for the pain that i felt inside
best recognize i won't be denied, when we ride

<i>[repeated]</i>

they lieing to destroy our earth, little birth diseases, thirty millionth church for jesus
and still our young eating out cans, chiefing grams and weapons, i sold my first swam at seven,
a smidget after first grade, shirt sprayed with talents, you made us hurt make the balance.
instead of preaching violence and fear, silenced shares we moving, the evil go ahead a movement
or share me the spiritual form, hear a song rebellion, we gathered up the strong and felons,
the youth and all the poverty strain and were all the poverty dwelling, the story that the pottery telling
you find all in potter's field or the government files.

some say the government will watch me

and uh how's that for black history?
i stay strapped, and love to jack those that slang that crack misery ha
cause being a nigga means you love niggas
but how could you love niggas if you trying drug niggas?

cause when blacks kill blacks we stay trapped and thats, real
and we don't need no more statistic's
it's time to get more realistic for the young the black and the gifted
and uh
until my people get uplifted
there's no popping shit, just popping clips instead of marching we gon' rip
shit.

yo whoever shot tupac amaru shakur
will forever be a dead man laying on the floor
revolutionary thug shit dieing for every young poor black mother in the middle of the ghetto
we never had a chance to appreciate life
the government got a plan to eliminate the life 
of every black soul on the slavery land 
and oppositions we abolishing a slavery plan, pay attention every serious political band
got a division full of killers imperial scams
they wanna kill us all off and incarcerate the family of anyone opposing the war
they want us all to appreciate death and believe up in the white god praying to the heavens above.
ima never let a devil come separate the adamic covenant, the potter's field criminals coming for the government.

donât get ya life took tryinâ to run with ya homies, yâall know me
same nigga so quick to blast
on this worldwide mash, trying to get some cash
holla my name and the game will follow
wait and iâll murder these snakes tomorrow
bunch of washed up jealous ass punk though
quit bullshitting pac, flip the promo
makaveli rise, all you niggas die when i come
iâll do some fly shit and be done
they say pac ainât got love for the eastside
you a lying motherfucker, nigga we ride
watch ya mouth


<i>[intro: twopac]</i>
what's ya phone number?

<i>[verse one: twopac]</i>
now i can make music for ya tempo
it's just a mental written for the nymphos
that's a intro
shook when you rush me
woke up and touched
why do you wanna fuck me?
just cause i'm paid in the worst way, true
looking kinda good in ya birthday suit
i wonder if you wild and ya act shy
do you like to be on top or the backside
watch when you lick yo lips
shake yo hips
god damn i love that shit
let's stop faking be real now
i got a room and a hard on , still down?
you been staring a bar full of black dudes
say you wanna see my scar and my tattoos
when we headed for my hide out, act right
i'm a playa when i ride out, thats right
what's ya phone number?

<i>[chorus]</i>
baby it's a show
and we can get on all night
(baby lemme give you a call,
how long will it take to break you off)
to three or maybe four
i'm ready for it all, i'm down
(baby lemme give you a call,
how long will it take to break you off)

<i>[verse two: loui v]</i>
shit, you gotta work for the number
work a lil bit harder for my naked slumber
tryna get it on the come up
ease breeze one-two-three won't get it from me, no!
can you think a lil farther
baby throw me them keys and i'll push the galada
and i ain't tryna barter
vice grips on my hips
and my lips on the tip
now let ya face take a taste
i promise i will squirt and it won't be mase
dumb sprung up in my place
when you leave it ain't ya shoes but my neck you lace
now tell me now can you roll with a boss bitch
keep that thang standing tall for a boss bitch
game mean, keep it clean for a boss bitch
grab a pen and paper, seven digits of a boss bitch

<i>[chorus]</i>

<i>[verse three: twopac]</i>
oh shit, baby is a dime piece
more than just my piece
personally best from the gods
if i seen her right now
she could get me hard
didn't wanna talk to me just to see my car
never had sex with a rich rap star
'til i got her in the back of my homeboy's car
tell me why do we live this way?
money over bitches let me hear you say
what's yo phone number?
are you alone?
got a pocket full of rubberslet roam
til i tell ya girlfriend to take you home
i had fun but baby gotta leave me alone
picture in my rhyme take time to rewind these ordinary words i say
if you opening ya mouth
immediately you find it's time to let the outlawz play

<i>[verse four: o.c.]</i>
i know you wanna fuck lemme hear you say
give it to you good til i come in ya face
keep it running like a faucet
you the boss niggaaaaa
don't be scared to toss it up betcha cum quickaa
i know how you keep it so thuggish, thuggish
feel it through ya fingas how you grip this shit
got ya hittin' it like a bat
yea hit it like a bat
like yea mayne i'm high like a plane
in the back of a gfive
got my legs 'bout a mile high
got you gripping on my thighs
boy ya hands on fire
poppin' bottle looking at my shadow
how we get it
and no stoppin' how we did it
i don't know i just know i gotta get some
so ruthless, when i fuck better duck
when you see me whip 'pac in the truck
rolling like a eight ball
now lemme break you off

<i>[chorus xfour]</i>

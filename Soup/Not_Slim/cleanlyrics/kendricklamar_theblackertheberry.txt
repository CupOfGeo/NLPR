everything black, i don't want black
i want everything black, i ain't need black
some white some black, i ain't mean black
i want everything black


six in the mornin', fire in the street
burn, baby burn, that's all i wanna see
and sometimes i get off watchin' you die in vain
it's such a shame they may call me crazy
they may say i suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
but homie you made me
black don't crack my nigga

i'm the biggest hypocrite of two thousand and fifteen
once i finish this, witnesses will convey just what i mean
been feeling this way since i was sixteen, came to my senses
you never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, i meant it
i'm african-american, i'm african
i'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
pardon my residence
came from the bottom of mankind
my hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
you hate me don't you?
you hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
you're fuckin' evil i want you to recognize that i'm a proud monkey
you vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
and this is more than confession
i mean i might press the button just so you know my discretion
i'm guardin' my feelins, i know that you feel it
you sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga


i said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
and man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
how you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
but now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
all them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
remember this, every race start from the black, just remember that

i'm the biggest hypocrite of two thousand and fifteen
once i finish this, witnesses will convey just what i mean
i mean, it's evident that i'm irrelevant to society
that's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
curse me till i'm dead
church me with your fake prophesyzing that i'mma be just another slave in my head
institutionalize manipulation and lies
reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
you hate me don't you?
i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
jealous of my wisdom and cards i dealt
watchin' me as i pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
black and successful, this black man meant to be special
cat scans on my radar bitch, how can i help you?
how can i tell you i'm making a killin'?
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga



i'm the biggest hypocrite of two thousand and fifteen
when i finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree
this plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
it's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
i'm african-american, i'm african
i'm black as the heart of a fuckin' aryan
i'm black as the name of tyrone and darius
excuse my french but fuck you â no, fuck y'all
that's as blunt as it gets, i know you hate me, don't you?
you hate my people, i can tell cause it's threats when i see you
i can tell cause your ways deceitful
know i can tell because you're in love with the desert eagle
thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
it's funny how zulu and xhosa might go to war
two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
remind me of these compton crip gangs that live next door
beefin' with piru's, only death settle the score
so don't matter how much i say i like to preach with the panthers
or tell georgia state "marcus garvey got all the answers"
or try to celebrate february like it's my b-day
or eat watermelon, chicken, and kool-aid on weekdays
or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements
or watch bet cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street?
when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
hypocrite!

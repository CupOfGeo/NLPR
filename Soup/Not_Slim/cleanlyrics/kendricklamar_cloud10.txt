when the sun fall out the sky
all i have is me in the land of do or die
a freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
now, thatâs the ultimate high
to the cloud i go, cloud i go
one time, baby tell me ya need me
cloud i go, cloud i go
two time, baby tell me ya love me


cause iâve been drinking too much, thinking too much
we ainât been keeping in touch
fell into lust, where is the love?
my independency got tendencies of lack of trust
i look at the street corners as my new woman
seductive as you wanna be, hands on my new garments
and luckily, being in denial ainât the case
cause i know sheâs unfaithful
instead iâm grabbing her waist
and every part of her is tasteful
i know youâre feelings hating
fact, you think iâm ungrateful, i know
selfish as i wanna be and every time you under me
i get the vibe you might need some time to grow




cause i been dreaming too much, thinking too much
we ainât been keeping in touch
and every time that i think of your touch
adrenaline pump, give me that rush
iâm gone like a thief inside the wind
lord forgive me for my sins
i know she want me more, but i fiend for benjamins
she said i found the root of all evil, and lost a friend
lost in the world of a young boy from compton
that never knew love because love was never promised
i know, selfish as i wanna be
and every time iâm under you, me too
need time to grow

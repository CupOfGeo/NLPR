i need some water
somethin' came over me
way too hot to simmer down
might as well overheat
too close to comfort
as blood rush my favorite vein
heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
i just need you to want me
am i askin' too much?
let me put the head in
ooh, i don't want more than that
girl, i respect the cat
i promise just a touch
let me put the head in
if it's okay
she said, "it's okay."


yeah, i need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
i need everybody's motherfuckin'-

wake up in the mornin'
thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
don't go to work today, cop you a fit
or maybe some kicks and make you-

i need some water
somethin' came over me
way too hot to simmer down
might as well overheat
too close to comfort
as blood rush my favorite vein
heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
i just need you to want me
am i askin' too much?
let me put the head in
ooh, i don't want more than that
girl, i respect the cat
i promise just a touch
let me put the head in
if it's okay
she said, "it's okay."

i wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
both in the trance, feelings i did-what a fast life!
manager called, the lobby called, it's eleven: thirty
did this before, promised myself i'd be a hour early
room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
fumbled my jewelry, one hundredk, i lost a new chain
hop on the bird, hit the next city for another m
take me a nap and do it again
we all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
all of us worried, all of us buried, and our feeling's deep
none of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
time passin', things change
revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways; lust

lately, i feel like i been lustin' over the fame
lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
lately, lately, lately, my lust been hidin' (lately)
lately, it's all contradiction
lately, i'm not here
lately, i lust over self
lust turn into fear
lately, in james four: four says
friend of the world is enemy of the lord
brace yourself, lust is all yours

i need some water
somethin' came over me
way too high to simmer down
might as well overheat
too close to comfort
as blood rush my favorite vein
heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
i just need you to want me
am i askin' too much?
let me put the head in
ooh, i don't want more than that
girl, i respect the cat
i promise just a touch
let me put the head in
if it's okay
she said, "it's okay."

i'm zonin off of one joint, stoppin a limo
hopped in the window, shoppin a demo at gunpoint
a lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
fuck a needle, here's a sword, bodypierce with this
livin amuk, never givin a fuck
gimme the keys i'm drunk, and i've never driven a truck
but i smoke dope in a cab
i'll stab you with the sharpest knife i can grab
come back the next week and re-open your scab (yeah!)
a killer instinct runs in the blood
emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud
i've calmed down now -- i was heavy once into drugs
i could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
my brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
the rest of my body's still bein operated on
i'm ducked the fuck down while i'm writin this rhyme
cause i'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time

for all the weed that i've smoked - yo this blunt's for you
to all the people i've offended - yeah fuck you too!
to all the friends i used to have - yo i miss my past
but the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
for all the drugs that i've done - yo i'm still gon' do
to all the people i've offended - yeah fuck you too!
for everytime i reminisce - yo i miss my past
but i still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

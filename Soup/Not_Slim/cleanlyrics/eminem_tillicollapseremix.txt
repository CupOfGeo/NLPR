sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
when you feel weak, you feel like you just wanna just give up
but you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.

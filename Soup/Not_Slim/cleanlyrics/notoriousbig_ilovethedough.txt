hah, what, how real is this?
uh, uh, how real is this?
what? uh, what?

and the watches be all types and shapes of stones
being broke is childish and i'm quite grown
run up in the club with the ice on, me and paisan
scope the spot out, see something nice and i'm gone

you cats is home, screaming the fight's on
i'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watching tyson
same night, same fight
but one of us cats ain't playing right
i let you tell it

people place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
and tell me you won't ball every chance you get
and any chance you hit, we live for the moment
makes sense don't it?

now make dollars
cats pop bottles
bone chicks that favor idalis
and rack up frequent flier mileage

don't forget the vinyl
take girls break spinals
biggie be richie like lionel
shit
you seen the jesãºs, dipped to h classes
ice project off lights, chick flashes

blind your broke asses
even got rocks in the beards and mustaches
rock top fashions
ain't shit changed
except the number after the dot
on the range
way niggas look at me now, kinda strange
i hate y'all too
rather be in caribbean sands with rachel
it's unreal
out the blue frank white got sex appeal
bitches used to go, "ewww!"

still tote steel
i'm trying to see five mil
off the single, for real
you ain't fazing the amazing
while your gun's raising, mine is blazing

see you on see me all talking to sweetness
take it for weakness and leave quick
blocker, roc-a-fella, bad boy collabo
two mcs with mad dough, you know!

snap like cameras on amateurs
make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours
jig and big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
everybody got a part to play, back to yours

run up in your crib now, crack your doors
watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
play the charts like the beatles, y'all adapt to loss
and toast cristal on behalf of y'all

too bad for y'all, ain't too many as bad as yours
truly, do we, we laugh at y'all
little bastards y'all
uh, uh

we hit makers with acres
roll shakers in vegas, you can't break us
lost chips on lakers, gassed-off shaq
country house, tennis courts on horseback

riding deciding cracked crab or lobster
who say mobsters don't prosper?
niggas is actors, niggas deserve oscars

me. i'm critically acclaimed
slug past your brain
reminisce on dames who coochie used to stink
when we rocked house pieces and puffy gucci links
now we buy homes in unfamiliar places
tito smile every time he see our faces

cases catch more than outfielders
half these rapping cats ain't seen war
couldn't score if they had point game, they lame
speak my name, i make 'em dash like dame

i love the dough more than you know
gotta let it show, i love the dough, hey
i love the dough more than you know
gotta let it show, i love the dough, hey

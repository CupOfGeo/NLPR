love, let's talk about love
is it anything and everything you hoped for?
or do the feeling haunt you?
i know the feeling haunt you


tell me what you gon' do to me
confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
you can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
but you can't bring the truth to me
fuck you and all your expectations
i don't even want your congratulations
i recognize your false confidence
and calculated promises all in your conversation
i hate people that feel entitled
look at me crazy 'cause i ain't invite you
oh, you important?
you the moral to the story? you endorsin'?
motherfucker, i don't even like you
corrupt a man's heart with a gift
that's how you find out who you dealin' with
a small percentage who i'm buildin' with
i want the credit if i'm losin' or i'm winnin'
on my momma, that's the realest shit

love, let's talk about love
is it anything and everything you hoped for?
or do the feeling haunt you?
i know the feeling haunt you

skin covered in ego
get to talkin' like ya involved, like a rebound
got no end game, got no reason
got to stay down, it's the way that you making me feel
like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
you kinda feeling like you're tryna get away from me
if you do, i won't move
i ain't just cryin' for no reason
i ain't just prayin' for no reason
i give thanks for the days, for the hours
and another way, another life breathin'
i did it all 'cause it feel good
i wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
better live your life, we're runnin' out of time

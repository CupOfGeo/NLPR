can i live til my last day
hittin honies that be na-sty
gettin money in the fast way
and i only care halfway
but i still can't let you pass me

you already know what it's about when i run up in your house
put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
i give this faggot a french kiss
black gloves, no prints, dark tints
word on the street they ain't heard from him since
you know about life after kicked the kid in
since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
scri-dam the flow is forbidd-en
either you ridin or you dyin cause we swingin iron
lox and poppa, turning niggaz into jim hoffa
who gon stop us, it's your last joint double copper
you gettin money or your runnin from the feds
ain't nothin over here but sixteen and one in the head
and i solemnly swear
that all y'all niggaz out there got a problem this year

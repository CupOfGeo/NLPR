i used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary
thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
since my uncles was institutionalised
my intuition has said i was suited for family ties
my mama is stressing, my daddy tired
i need me a weapon, these niggas ride
every minute, hour and second, ministers tried
to save me, how i'm gon' listen when i don't even hear god?
heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
my hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink
you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
that same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
i deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun
and you'll be looking in my eyes homie

you think about it, and don't call me lyrical
cause really i'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
i know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
my simplest shit be more pivotal
i penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
worry some individuals that live life critical
so won't you bare witness while i bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
but anyway, this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
on "wanna be heard" probably thought he worked my nerves
but really he was stressing me, getting what i deserved
somebody said my name on the radio, he ain't know
i was ready for the world that minute
so the next time he roll up and drop grams in it, he'll probably be

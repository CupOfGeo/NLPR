got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson with madness
now just imagine the magic i light to asses
don't ask for your favorite rapper

(he dead) yessir
(amen) church
(he dead) i killed him
(amen) bitch

and this is rigamortis
and it's gorgeous when you die
ali recorded and i'm morpheus,
the matrix in my mind
i'm out the orbit
you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
i'm on the toilet when i rhyme
if you the shit then i decline
i climax when you begin
and then i end on cloud nine
and that's important when you morph
into an angel in the sky
and don't be forging all my signatures
my listeners reply and tell me
that you biting style
you got a hell of an appetite
and i'm be here for a while
just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you could fight
we always making them duck or die
a suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
csi, just might investigate
this fucking parasite

(he dead)
(amen)

that's what they telling me
aim it at your celebrity
this is studio felony
pharrell got me too many
and cool enough for the seventys
nigga, payback's a bitch
and bitch you been living in debt with me
that i more than especially
leave a call on his mother voicemail
to say that he rest in peace
bigger chopper the recipe
wrestling, that's irrelevant
rather rest at your residence
whistling to the melody
couldn't think of a better d
better be on your p and q
it's just me jay rock, soul and q
solar system ain't barbeque
ain't nothing else you can do

(he dead) yup, yup
(amen) i killed him
(he dead) hahaha
(amen) amen

got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

(he dead) yup, yup
(amen) i know
(he dead) for sure
(amen) amen

got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

i rapped him and made him casper
i captured the likes of nasa
my pedigree to fly past ya
i pass the weed to the pastor
we all are sinners,
won't you send us to bible study faster
you hypocrit-esque is reaction of blasphemy
i assassin my casualty
and it's casually done
and tell 'em my salary come
a lump sum of hundreds
don't talk to be bout no money
the sun is under my feet
and i come in peace to compete
i don't run if you rather leap
my statistics go up in weeks
and i go visit the nearest creek
and i get busy on many mc
really ballistic, anybody can see
any assistance, everybody done see
some persistence, recognize i be
really too vicious, the permanent beast
and the demolition, breaking up the streets
better partition, better dot your t
and i gon' mention, how the far you see
putting my dick in the rap industry
everybody bitchin', getting mad at me
recognize kendrick, in the battery
and i'm charged up, and the catastrophe
is charged up, and the audacity
and y'all fucks, never could hassle me
and y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

(he dead) yup, yup
(amen) i know
(he dead) for sure
(amen) amen

got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard

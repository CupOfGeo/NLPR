when the whole world see you as pac reincarnated
thatâs enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
find the tallest building in vegas and jump off it
but i could never rewrite history in a coffin
so iâm talking to god, âcan you wash all these demons off me?â
this last year iâve been quite similar to aaliyah
control my own destiny, only rapper that steered
a gfive, gâs give high-fives to me and say, âkendrick, just persevere.â
the presents of being rare
as i lay in this four corner room staring at candles
thinking, âhow can i make an example, for this generation of compton?â
my biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
or turning back to that same accomplice
my past life was a child with no act right
trying to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
assuring that some blossom early and some truant
thank god for the album i idolized
itâs dark and plus hell is hot, thatâs the start of this crazy ride
two young niggas, me and dave inside the garage
and thought we was jay and dame
thats the lane that we tried to drive
truthfully, i just started rappinâ to get away
i never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
my nigga got hit twenty-five times with a k
make the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse
now punch is my mentor, top dawg is the coach
jay rock is my older brother, i was there when he wrote
his name on his record deal, we had figured the coast
would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store
find ourselves scrambling, tryna figure it out
soul told me that the record shop âbout to go in a drought
q ainât got a place to stay, and âbout to sleep on the couch
we eating off each other tray, the dollar menu amount
meanwhile the coast going hard at each other
the younger rappers had wanted some of the ogsâ comfort
but i ainât need it
i never screamed out the ânew westâ, i didnât believe it
they brought each other down, i was planning out my achievements
i need to separate myself to stand out
i need a better way to take your fans now
i need to kill you motherfuckers dead
three hollow tips aimed at your head
iâll be damned if the chopper jam now
and we never asked for no hand out
in the midst of it all i recall a called when you said how
we could never resolve in the hall of fame
and iâm with the trial with a bible and a rifle
i play the game as i plan blow
hollaback at me, nigga
and if they said iâm the one, why you asking me, nigga?
cause when the whole world see you as pac reincarnated
thatâs enough pressure to make you just open the book of david
and pray to god hat make it or live your life in the matrix
cause falling off is a sickness, i heard that itâs quite contagious
i need to separate myself to stand out
i need a better way to take your fans now
i need to kill you motherfuckers dead
three hollow tips aimed at your head


iâll be damned if the chopper jam now
and we never asked for no hand out
iâll take you back to that pack of black &amp; milds in my hand now
in the midst of it all was cooking with pots and pans out
looking forward as four of us are forced to form a new clan now
fast forward as i wait in line for this passport
the homies was still poor, was working at jansport


whoever thought that rosenberg would mention me to dre?
even vanessa from xxl had told him to press play
and there goes my fate, now iâm on stage with snoop
gave me the torch and i ran with it in high pursuit
rapped with my forefathers, even record with gaga too
lyricist of the year, fuck am i supposed to do? rock


laughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes
exaggerated shit that we had rapped had came true
thought i was aggravated, when warner had let me loose
i was honest, see they was haunted when mike jones didnât recoup


cool, cause niggas wonât outdo us in the booth
even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof
i came, i saw, i conquered
no shame, i blame all of this on compton
thinking about when sherane tried to set me up
cold game, full circle, they set up her
i put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs
the fight to ignite any wrong or right that i prolong
the story was short film, the glory of him and them
the worry of mother who donât recover when baby killed
the trial and tribulations, the newer miseducation
the view of body wasting, you knew somebody who didnât make it
the angry, the adolescent, the reason i ask this question
will you let hip-hop die on october twenty-twond?
will you let hip-hop die on october twenty-twond?

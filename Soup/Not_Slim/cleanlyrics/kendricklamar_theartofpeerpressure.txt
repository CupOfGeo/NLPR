everybody, everybody, everybody
everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen
to this true mothafuckin' story told by kendrick lamar on rosecrans
ya bish

smoking on the finest dope, aye aye aye aye
drank until i can't no more, aye aye aye aye
really i'm a sober soul but i'm with the homies right now
and we ain't asking for no favors
rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later, aye aye aye aye
really i'm a peacemaker but i'm with the homies right now
and momma used to say
one day, it's gon' burn you out
one day, it's gon' burn you out, out
one day, it's gon' burn you out
one day, it's gon' burn you
but i'm with the homies right now

me and my niggas four deep in a white toyota
a quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
janky stash box when the federales roll up
basketball shorts with the gonzales park odor
we on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
i hope the universe love you today
âcause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
a flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
if itâs necessary
bumping jeezy first album looking distracted
speaking language only we know, you think is an accent
the windows roll down all i see is a hand pass it
hotboxing like george foreman grilling the masses
of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
and asked them what they working with â look at me
i got the blunt in my mouth
usually iâm drug-free, but shit iâm with the homies

(yea nigga, we off a pill and remy red
come through and bust ya head nigga)
me and the homies
(sag all the way to the liquor store
where my niggas pour up four and get twisted some more)
me and the homies
(i ride for my mothafuckinâ niggas
hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
me and the homies
(matter fact, i hop out that mothafucka and be like
âdoo! doo! doo! doo!...doo! doo! doo! doo! doo!â)

itâs two:thirty and the sun is beaming
air conditioner broke and i hear my stomach screaming
hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
iâll tell you to suck my dick then i'll continue eating
we speeding on the four hundred and five passing westchester
you know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good lord
they knew we werenât from âround there
âcause every time we down there we pulling out the boost mobile sim cards
bougie bitches with no extensions
hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
before we sparked a conversation
we seen three niggas in colors we didnât like then started interrogating
i never was a gangbanger, i mean i was never stranger to the folk neither
i really doubt it
rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
thatâs ironic âcause iâve never been violent, until iâm with the homies

(just ridinâ, just ridinâ)
me and the homies
(bullshittinâ, actinâ a fool)
me and the homies
(trippinâ, really trippinâ)
me and the homies
(just ridinâ, just ridinâ, just ridinâ...)

bragging âbout the episode we just had
a shot of hennessey didnât make me feel that bad
iâm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
we tryna conquer the city with disobedience
quick to turn it up, even if we ainât got the cd in
but jeezy still playing and our attitude is still ânigga, what is you sayingâ
pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
the sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(ay, ay, nigga jackpot nigga, pop the safe
ay nigga, i think it's somebody in this room
wait, what?
nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
i hit the back window in search of any nintendo
dvds, plasma screen tvs in the trunk
we made a right, then made a left, then made a right
then made a left, we was just circling life
my mama called â "hello? what you doin'?" âkicking itâ
i shouldâve told her iâm probably âbout to catch my first offense with the homies

but they made a right, they made a left then made a right
then another right
one lucky night with the homies

k. dot, you faded, hood?
yea we finally got that nigga faded. i think he hit the wrong blunt though
ooh, which one?
well which one he talking 'bout? i was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
i pray he ain't hit that

got the shenanigans? give that nigga the shenanigans
nigga i think we should push back to the city, fo real doe nigga, for what?
what that nigga, what's that jeezy song say nigga?
"last time i checked i was the man on these streets!"
yea, yea, that shit right there. i'm tryna be the nigga in the street

aye, i remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
finesse a nigga with some counterfeits
but now i'm counting this
parmesan where my accountant lives in fact i'm down at this
d'usåe with my boo bae, tastes like kool aid for the analysts
girl, i can buy your ass the world with my paystub
ooh that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods
i get way too petty once you let me do the extras
pull up on your block, then break it down we playing tetris
a.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m. funk
piss out your per diem you just gotta hate em, funk
if i quit your bm i still ride mercedes, funk
if i quit this season i still be the greatest, funk
my left stroke just went viral
right stroke put lil baby in a spiral
soprano c, we like to keep it on a high note
it's levels to it, you and i know, bitch be humble

(hol' up bitch) sit down,
(hol' up lil bitch, hol' up, lil bitch) be humble
(hol' up bitch) sit down (sit down hol' up lil bitch)

(hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up lil bitch) bitch, sit down
(hol' up lil bitch) be humble
(hol' up bitch) sit down
(hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

get the fuck off my stage, i'm the sandman (sandman)
get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
i make a play fucking up your whole life
i'm so fucking sick and tired of the photoshop
show me something natural like afro on richard pryor
show me something natural like ass with some stretch marks
still will take you down right on your mamma's couch in polo socks, aye

the doctor said i need about three weeks of recovery
but the nurses is lovin me
sayin the best part of the day is my half
feedin me breakfast, and givin me a sponge bath
niggaz say i died dead in the streets
nigga i'm gettin high, gettin head on the beach
chillin, sittin on about half a million
with all my niggaz, all my guns, all my women
next two years, i should see about a billion
all for the love of drug dealin
got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks (fuck them)
any repercussion, junior m.a.f.i.a. spit clips (that's right)
all the time, big poppa kick the war rhymes
raw flows, and that's how it goes

this for my niggaz slingin thangs, had my ring encaged
truck, necklace, igloo ring and things
for the bitches, who see them rims spin and grin
that shit with the v-trim that win
and the enormous fields disperse of rap
on the road to the riches more furs to drag
more niggaz to kill, than birds to bag
hit the jeweler and splurge the tab, uh
hops, out the truck like, "trick, what up?"
call me sean if you suck, call me gone when i nut
that's the end of us, get your friend to fuck
untwist and bend her up, you know the deal
niggaz talkin real greasy on some ballin shit (that's right)
funny how quick these pricks forget
actin like i ain't the reason they traded they shit
switched that five, copped that six (that's right)
it's all good, you know who the clone is
fuck the joneses, niggaz tryin to keep up with the combses

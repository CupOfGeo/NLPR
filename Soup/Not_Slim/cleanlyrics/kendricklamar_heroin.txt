it was i witnessing poverty
burning bullets allowing these walls breaking
devour these laws trying to empower me
i thought i knew the reason you grew to love sour diesel
smoking like locomotive your focus was hourly
and then you caught me your pity party  me
shower me with the will that never dried
i tell you put your worries and friendly doubts to the side
i doubt that you listen, itâs stuck in your system i tried
sheâs been miserable, sheâs been living in prison
soaking up lifeâs reality this is the visual
baby daddy a light build blade walking with highheel
paid stalking that avenue, never knew how the light feel, i
got a plane got a plan for ya
i just just might hold a couple bands for ya
and leave this message in the sand for ya
tell me youâre ready to change
she said naw nigga itâs part of the game
just like heroin


streets don't fail me now need you right on time
say, right on time
please stay paced and the ground need you right on time
say, you right on time
streets don't fail me now need you right on time
say, you right on time
god please lift the smile need you right on time
say, right on time


functioning addict, iâm high off her passion
chasing historyâs baddest, i mastered this apparatus
rackin' my brain, i'm scared of being average
going against the grain just tryna maintain my savage
foolish of her to try to play towards my vanity
and foolish of me to let her do it, i love calamity
i love a challenge, naw i love the fantasy
and this is high stakes i risk it all for a pair of snakes
connect the dot nigga this is fate
i'm talking predestination
i'm talking blind dedication
plan b is contraception we didnât make it
sexercise a little bit of patience
the love of the rush is us
im addicted to violence, helicopters and sirens
blood pressure is skying, nigga i'm trying
i never felt more alive than i felt dying
heroin


streets don't fail me now need you right on time
say, right on time
please stay paced and the ground need you right on time
say, you right on time
streets don't fail me now need you right on time
say, you right on time
god please lift the smile need you right on time
say, right on time


i heard you spending all your time baby (ohhhhhh)
and you could never get a dime baby (never get a dime)
at least a nigga got a dime baby (at least a nigga got it)
it's hard to come home (hard to come home)
it's hard to come home (hard to come home baby)


she my gift and my curse, she really quenching my thirst
baby my vice, she got me driving with no headlights (is that right?)
she know my thoughts, pleasures and pain
everybody love her and she love everybody the same

she said i got a plan, got a plan for ya
i might hold a couple bands for ya
leave a message in the sand for ya

tell me you want me to change, hell naw i'm still sippin the same
nigga it's just like heroin

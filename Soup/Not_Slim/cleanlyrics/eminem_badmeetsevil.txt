who hard? yo i done heard worse
we can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
to see which one'll swerve first
two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
that of a globe on top of nine other planets
kissed the cheek of the devil
intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto
dismissal, i'm not a fair man
disgraced the race of an atheist
intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
one track sliced without swords
i buried the christ corpse
in my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
and stay over-worked, it's like the nazis and the nation
collaborating attempting to take over the earth


the disaster with dreads
i'm bad enough to commit suicide
and survive long enough to kill my soul after i'm dead
when in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
cause i serve any stranger with money
i spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
while slipping bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws
with my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
i'm blazing mcs, at the same time amazing mcs
somehow, mcs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me
from all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough
to cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt


cause this is what happens when bad meets evil
and we hit the trees 'til we look like vietnamese people
he's evil, and i'm bad like steve seagal
against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel
(we'll be waiting) see you in hell
wall street, royce da five'nine", slim shady
see you in hell for the sequel (bye-bye)
bad meets evil, what ('til next time)

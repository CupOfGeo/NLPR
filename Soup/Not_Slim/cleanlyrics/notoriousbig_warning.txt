who the fuck is this?
paging me at five:forty-six in the morning
crack a dawn and
now i'm yawning, wipe the cold out my eye
see who's this paging me and why
it's my nigga pop from the barbershop
told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
of niggas wanna stick me like fly paper neighbour
slow down love please chill drop the caper

"remember them niggas from the hill
up in brownsville
that you rolled dice with
smoked blunts and got nice with?"

yeah my nigga fame up in prospect
nah them my niggas nah love wouldn't disrespect

"i didn't say them
they schooled me to some niggas
that you knew from back when
when you was clocking minor figures
now they heard you're blowing up like nitro
when they wanna stick the knife
through your windpipe slow
so thank fame for warning me
'cause now i'm warning you
i got the mac nigga
tell me what you gonna do."

damn niggas wanna stick me for my paper
damn niggas wanna stick me for my paper
damn niggas wanna stick me for my paper
damn niggas wanna stick me for my paper

"they heard about the rolexes and the lexus
with the texas license plate outta state
they heard about the pounds
you got down in georgetown
and they heard you got half of virginia locked down
they even heard about the crib
you bought your moms south florida
the fifth corridor."

there's gonna be a lot of slow singing
and flower bringing
if my burglar alarm starts ringing

all-purpose war
got the rottweilers by the door
and i feed 'em gun powder
so they can devour
the criminals

and it ain't a dream
things ain't always what it seems
it's the ones that smoke blunts with you

grab they guns and come and get you

i got the calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
so i can rip through the ligaments

i wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
stewardess complimentinâ me on my nappy hair
if i can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
theyâll probâly think iâm a terrorist
eat my asparagus, then iâm askinâ her
thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
a crash dummy for diamonds, i know you dyinâ to meet âem
iâll probâly die in a minute
just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a comptown fitted

holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)

yeah, big shit poppinâ
section eighty

back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
witâ my back against the wall and yoâ bitch on the edge of my dick
jump off
i call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
i never did nothinâ but break the ground on top of the asphalt
tire mark gave you evidence that iâm easily peddlinâ with the speed of a lightninâ bolt
as a kid i killed two adults, iâm too advanced
i live my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
truth be told, iâm like eighty-seven
wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire witâ devils holdinâ hands
from the distance, donât know which one is a christian, damn
who can i trust in two thousand and twelve? thereâs no one
not even myself, a gemini screaminâ for help, somebody

holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)

yeah, big shit poppinâ, everybody watchinâ
when you do it like this, nigga, losinâ ainât an option

holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)

yeah, big shit poppinâ
(ay, ay, kick her out the studio, ali)

twenty-four/seven nigga, workinâ his ass for it, she poppinâ that ass for it
the king of diamonds witâ diamonds i never do ask for
they checkinâ my passport, iâm too accustomed with customs
she call in the task force, i killed it, somebody cuff âim
they want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
when you niggas is past poor, youâll never hop in my lane
when you pushinâ a ravfour, you wreckinâ my jaguar
you play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard

holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)

yeah, big shit poppinâ, everybody watchinâ
when you do it like this, nigga, losinâ ainât an option

holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)
holâ up (holâ up)

yeah, big shit poppinâ, everybody watchinâ
when you do it like this, niggaâ¦

i wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
stewardess complimentinâ me on my nappy hair
if i can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
theyâll probâly think iâm osama
the plane emergency landed, it was an honor

holâ up

uh, she got me going, i'm all in
fifty stories, i'm falling
where you been? is it planet mars?
far beyond the stars? are you a martian?
you're unfamiliar, but still i feel ya
energy is sending me toward the ceiling
i'm high now, are you up there?
if you was, i would climb every other stair
i gotta stare, i mean wow
and i'm wowed, no one compares
a one-on-one, you must have won
every pageant in america when you was young
lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy, insane, crazy
the only girl that can make time, then make me stop


uh, so now we on, so now we gone
living in the city of the unknown
i show her off, i stunt with her
we do it sweet, they look bitter
look at her get up, i hear 'em say
but why him? i hear 'em hate
i laugh at it, rather than jab at it
then continue eternal life as a crack addict
cause i'm addicted, and you the drug
cold turkey? no sir
gotta be an odyssey from heaven way above
you definite, not probably, i gotta give it up
lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy, insane, crazy
the only girl that can make time, then make me stop


you something different
i'm glad i found you
so pretty
i'll never do anything to hurt you

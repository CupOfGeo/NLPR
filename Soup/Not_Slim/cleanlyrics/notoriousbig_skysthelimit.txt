uhhh
a nigga never been as broke as me, i like that
when i was young i had two pair of lees, besides that
the pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
the one i wore on mondays and wednesdays
while niggas flirt, i'm sewing tigers on my shirt
and alligators
ya wanna see the inside, huh, i see ya later
here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga wit the fake, blaow!
why you punch me in my face, stay in ya place
play ya position, here come my intuition
go in this nigga pocket
rob him while his friends watchin
that hoes clockin, here comes respect
his crew's your crew, or they might be next
look at they man eye, big man they never try
so we roll wid em, stole wid em
i mean loyalty, niggaz bought me milks at lunch
the milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch
in here, eyes crossed from blue and white dust
pass the blunt

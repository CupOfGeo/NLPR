i don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again
(aye aye nigga what's happenin' nigga, k dot back in the hood nigga)
i'm mad (he mad), but i ain't stressin'
true friends, one question

black man taking no losses
bitch where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin' (king kunta)

when you got the yams (what's the yams?)
the yam is the power that be
you can smell it when i'm walking down the street
(oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
i can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer
what the fuck happened?
(oh no) i swore i wouldn't tell
but most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell
(a two man cell)
something's in the water (something's in the water)
and if i got a brown nose for some gold then i'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

everybody wanna cut the legs off him (king kunta) kunta
black man taking no losses

when you got the yams (what's the yams?)
the yam brought it out of richard pryor
manipulated bill clinton with desires
twenty-four/seven, three hundred and sixty-five days times two
i was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say...

you goat mouth mammy fucker
i was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help
this shit is elementary, i'll probably go to jail
if i shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "compton"
i should probably run for mayor when i'm done, to be honest
and i put that on my mama and my baby boo too
twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo
ah yeah fuck the judge
i made it past twenty-five and there i was
a little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
life ain't shit but a fat vagina
screamin' "annie are you ok? annie are you ok?"
limo tinted with the gold plates
straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
from a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king

bitch where was you when i was walkin'-

(by the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you)

now i run the game got the whole world talkin' (king kunta)
everybody wanna cut the legs off him (king kunta) kunta
black man taking no losses
bitch where was you when i was walkin'
now i run the game got the whole world talkin' (king kunta)
everybody wanna cut the legs off him

(funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)
we want the funk

(now if i give you the funk, you gon' take it)
we want the funk
(now if i give you the funk, you gon' take it)

i remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence

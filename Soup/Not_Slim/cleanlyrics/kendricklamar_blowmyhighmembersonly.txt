taking off when you landing
bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
and i'm dancing on them stars
the galaxy ain't got room for y'all
ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
while i'm here, and every day i hear
your bullshit, self-pity
reason why you never dealt with me
reason why your girl dealt with me
hands up in the building, we get busy, and say
r-i-p aaliyah, r-i-p, yep
r-i-p aaliyah, r-i-p, yep
that's exactly what this sound like
a to the a to the l-i-y
a-h, give it up two times
then give it right back, don't blow my high


look at my life, then look at yours
get some ambition, why you bored?
time will never wait on no man
society will never hold your hand
niggas like to gossip like bitches
got me thinking you don't like bitches
wonder what's behind them ray bans
eyes of a coward, i understand
niggas like to gossip like bitches
sip don perignon, when we finish, we say
r-i-p aaliyah, r-i-p, yep
r-i-p aaliyah, r-i-p, yep
that's exactly what this sound like
but never will i ever forget left eye
roll up, put a ribbon in the sky
and a button on your lips, don't blow my high


now everybody sing this shit


look at my life and look at yours
get some ambition, why you bored?
r-i-p aaliyah, r-i-p
r-i-p aaliyah, r-i-p
r-i-p aaliyah, r-i-p
r-i-p aaliyah, r-i-p

it's the ten crack commandments what
nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed
to my hustling niggas
niggas on the corner i ain't forget you niggas
my triple beam niggas, word up

ten

i been in this game for years, it made me a animal
there's rules to this shit, i wrote me a manual
a step-by-step booklet for you to get
your game on track, not your wig pushed back

rule number uno: never let no one know
how much dough you hold,
'cause you know
the cheddar breed jealousy especially
if that man fucked up
get your ass stuck up

number two:
never let 'em know your next move
don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence
take it from your highness
i done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips

number three:
never trust nobody
your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
hoodied and masked up
shit, for that fast buck
she be laying in the bushes to light that ass up

number four:
know you heard this before
never get high on your own supply

number five:
never sell no crack where you rest at
i don't care if they want a ounce,
tell 'em "bounce"

number six:
that goddamn credit, dead it
you think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it

seven: this rule is so underrated
keep your family and business completely separated
money and blood don't mix
like two dicks
and no bitch
find yourself in serious shit

number eight:
never keep no weight on you
them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too

number nine shoulda been number one to me
if you ain't getting bagged stay the fuck from police
if niggas think you snitching they ain't tryna listen
they be sitting in your kitchen, waiting to start hitting

number ten:
a strong word called "consignment"
strictly for live men,
not for freshmen
if you ain't got the clientã¨le say "hell no!"
'cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow

follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
if not, twenty-four years, on the wake up
slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
caretaker did your makeup,
when you passed
your girl fucked my man jake up,
heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half of cake up
heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up

crack king, frank wiz-zhite

ten

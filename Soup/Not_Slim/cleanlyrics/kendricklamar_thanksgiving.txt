now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
you're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
my itinerary is very hectic
i break records on every record, i'm truly reckless
kendrick lamar, know how to maul with my wrist
shout to writers for holding it down bitch
me and my down bitch, get busy
i'm busy taking over, the world
with the weight of the world on my shoulder
my drive is not to be chauffeured
i'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, i've done situated myself, i ain't lying
be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
the good kid from the mad city
holding a cereal box instead of a glock
in a one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two caddilac that i got from my pops
transmission slipping, but i ain't tripping, swallow my pride
pop in my tape and roll the window, down
like stacie homie when airing out endo
i wish a nigga would

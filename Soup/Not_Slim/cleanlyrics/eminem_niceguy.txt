suck my dick, you fucking suck man
suck my dick, you fucking suck man
i hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
suck my dick, you fucking suck man

i hop in your whip and take a sip then i gun it
i don't, i don't got my self control, i hope that you running
i'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cumming
i don't, i don't got much self control, i hope that you running


i'm not a cheater, but if i'ma be accused, might as well be
you tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes but females be
rushin' me outside my telly, temptation overwhelms me
like my monthly bill from sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie

suck my dick, you fucking suck bitch
suck my dick, you fucking suck man
i hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
suck my dick, you fucking suck, bitch


i'm an emotional wreck, weak, everything over affects me
when you joke it upsets me, you say i'm no good at sex
and you think i'm gross and unsexy
i need scope 'cause my breath stinks
you hope that i choke on a pepsi
bitch you was supposed to correct me
been texting you since three, i still get no fucking reply
you say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
fuck you going in those knee high boots, cut it out bitch
i doubt that you're going to house sit in that outfit, and those skin-tight levi's
every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
you say "don't come over" 'cause you got pink eye
but i think i got just the thing
why don't i bring my fucking bat and just swing by

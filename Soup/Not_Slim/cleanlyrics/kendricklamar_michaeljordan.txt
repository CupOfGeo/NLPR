i used to want to be like michael jordan
figured i would hit the nba and make me a fortune


this shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
pull up on them twenty-sixes, i'm a vanity slave
i'm a sinner, jesus christ, please forgive me for my ways
i don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and i don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
i'm a comp-town representer, concrete backflipper
a.k.a. that nigga, don't worry
i don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and i don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
this is hiiipower, since the eddie bower i've been popular
i'm popping now, every other hour, paparazzi come
you jocking her, let her be a hoe, why you stopping though?
we stopping the traffic, what you know bout them hockey pucks?
skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? you should learn from 'em
see too many of y'all getting money, know my turn coming
i don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and i don't know why... "hey, wait a minute motherfucker"


man, the game chose me, what am i to do?
only thing i did wrong was make it possible
i diddy bop and make them titties pop
out there on my bumper like a city cop
walking down to fred segal, put my girl on it
ass so fat, probably sit the world on it
ay, pussy crazy, pussy crazy
you fuck niggas, you pussies crazy
man, i know i can't tell you bout the world homie
but i know i can tell you bout your girl homie
her pussy's crazy, her pussy crazy

i know they pay me, too much of attention
bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
i need me an engine that go real fast
call it "haul of fame", once it haul ass
give me tall glass, coconut ciroc
please no soda pop, i make my solo pop
life's a bitch, her pussy crazy
but i make that pussy pay me


i remember tripping, walking through the set like my glock don't think
grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink
i don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and i don't why you sucker niggas can't see
i'm from hoover mayne, high as supermayne, shit you lois lane
you pussy mayne with the pussy game, shit we off the chain
we popping ay, fortune, not the fame, shit you backwards mayne
you chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes
your broad that chose, yes she moving on, yep we do it wrong
we fuck the homes, fuck the center home, marijuana strong
you know i'm gone, turn my swagger on, am i swagged enough?
my paper long, yep you left alone, you gets none fucks
leaning off the actavis, passing blunts round and round
told mary/merry was a (go), so we passed her (round) and (round)
your bitch texted me, wants it now, so i had to knock her down
work her bouncing on my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
you let it slide, i hit home-runs, clean her dugout till i'm done
i can be her number two and you can be her number one
her pussy's crazy, her pussy's crazy
you fuck niggas

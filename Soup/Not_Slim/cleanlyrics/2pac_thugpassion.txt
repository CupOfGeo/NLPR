aight, new drink
one part alizã©, one part cristal
thug passion, baby
y'all know what time it is
this drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
now, if you with me
pour a glass and drink with a nigga, knowhatimean?
i ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols - alcoholics
i'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
so come and get some of this thug passion, baby

they say money don't make the man
but damn, i'm makin' money
observin' you motherfuckers, 'cause some of you bitches funny
say you want it but you bullshittin'
lickin' them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
sippin' on some alizã© and cristal, meanwhile
buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me, she smiles; a niggas full of passion
satisfaction is everlastin'
"how does it feel?" what i'm askin'
while i'm rubbin' on that ass "why you laughin'?"
see, i'm diggin' as if i'm curious
full blown and furious
baby, get a grip, when i be doin' this
it's so physical my attraction
driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction
baby i'm born to ball
thugged out on death row
you better recognize and picture what i said so
now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion

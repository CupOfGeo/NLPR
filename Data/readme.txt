Hello Patrick
This is a neural net project i have been working on to attempt to clone eminem.
i began with web scraping by first run songlistgenerator.py wich uses the artists.txt the only artists i have uncommented is eminem this will generate you a song_list.txt and a url_list.txt which will be used in the lyric_scraper.py which will scrape all the lyrics from the page and create them their own .txt file
i then put all the skits in a folder and made cleaner.py which takes all the txt files and cleans out all the bad ascii characters and creates the raw_lyrics.txt file which is all the lyrics in one file.
now im using text_gen_word_based.py to make my model
still figuring it all out will let you know.

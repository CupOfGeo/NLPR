to have one last hearttoheart
honest and open talk to you
doody, i see you
i go to walk to you
and i can feel my soul leave my body
and float across the room
nurses lean over the bed
pulling tubes out
then the sheet over my head
shut the room down
girls, please don't get upset
i see those cheeks soaking and wet
as you squeeze hold of my neck
so forcibly, don't wanna let
me go, pillow drenched
emotional wrecks
with every second each closer to death
but suddenly, i feel my heart
begin to beat slow, then a breath
machines go (beep, beep, beep)
must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
i'm tryna rewind time like a tape
find an escape
make a beeline
try and awake
from this dream, i need to refind
my inner strength
to remind me
even if a steep climb i must take
to rewrite a mistake
i'm rewinding the tape
(i don't want it)
i'll put out this last album, then i'm done with it
one hundred percent finished, fed up with it
i'm hanging it up, fuck it
excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
that i'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
and if things should worsen, but i bet you they won't
i'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
shred these old letters i wrote
all that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
i'm proud to be back
i'm 'bout to, like a rematch
outdo relapse
with recovery, mathers lp2
help propel me to
victory laps
gas toward them and fast forward the past
consider the last four minutes as
that's the song i'd have sang to my daughters
if i'd have made it to the hospital
less than two hours later, but i fought it
came back like a boomerang on 'em
now a new day is dawning
i'm up, tuesday, it's morning
yeah, yo i'm just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me, 'cause i feel like i wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness
straight out the gate, i'm 'bout to break it down
ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake i'm 'bout
to rape the alphabet, i may raise some brows
if i press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)
full magazine could take staples out
savage, but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
but, bitch, i'm off the chain like kala brown
motherfucker, shut the fuck up when i'm talkin', lil' bitch
i'm sorry, wait, what's your talent?
oh, critiquin' my talent?
oh, bitch, i don't know who the fuck y'all are
to give a subpar bar, even have an opinion or view
you mention me, millions of views, attention in news
i mention you, loselose for me, winwin for you
billions of views, your ten cents are two
skim through the music to give shit reviews
to get clicks, but, bitch, you just lit the fuse
don't get misconstrued, business as us'
shitlist renewed so get shit to do
or get dissed 'cause i just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' tto
do you have any idea how much i hate this choppy flow
everyone copies though? probably no
get this fuckin' audio out my audi yo, adios
i can see why people like lil yachty, but not me though
not even dissin', it just ain't for me
all i am simply is just an mc
maybe stan just isn't your cup of tea
(get it)
maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
maybe i need to stir up shit
preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
i should eat a pill, probably i will
old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
i breathe on the mirror, i don't see my breath
possibly i'm dead, i must be possessed
like an evil spell, i'm evil (evil, but spelled)
jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
bang it with a pipe wrench
while i take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
like vicepresident mike pence
back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip
these are things that i'd rather do than hear you on a mic
since ninetenths of your rhyme is about ice and
jesus christ, man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch?
(fuck my side chick!)
you won't ever see em icy, but as cold as i get on the mic
i polarize shit so the temps might freeze
and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it
bitch, i got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
turn down for what? i ain't loud enough
nah, turn the valium up!
'cause i don't know how i'm gonna get your mouths to shut
now, when it doesn't matter what caliber i spit at
i'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
you'll turn around and just be like, man, how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
and now he wants to take it out on us
(oohooh)
but last week, an exfan mailed me a copy
of the mathers lp to tell me to study
it'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (oohooh)
i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that
i'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
especially an effing recovery clone of me
so fingerbang, chicken wang, mgk, igg' azae'
lil pump, lil xan imitate lil wayne
i should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
i'm fed up with being humble
and rumor is i'm hungry, i'm sure you heard bumblings
i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
i heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbojumbo
the era that i'm from will pummel you
that's what it's comin' to
what the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
i'm gonna crumble you and i'll take a number two
and dump on you if you ain't joyner
if you ain't kendrick or cole or sean then you're a goner
i'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper
you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonald's
but if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get revival
but y'all are acting like i tried to serve you up a slider
maybe the vocals should have been autotuned
and you would have bought it
but sayin' i no longer got it
'cause you missed a lot and never caught it
'cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
with your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
what i'll never be is flawless, all i'll ever be is honest
even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it
even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
with a bottle full of malt liquor
but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer
the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom
if i don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
i don't see why y'all even started with me
i get in beefs, my enemies die
i don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
i'm east side, never be caught slippin'
now you see why i don't sleep
not even a wink, i don't blink
i don't doze off, i don't even nod to the beats
i don't even close my fuckin' eyes when i sneeze
aw, man! that bet cypher was weak, it was garbage
the thing ain't even orangeoh my god, that's a reach!
shout to all my colorblind people, each and every one of y'all
if you call a fire engine green, aquamarine
or you think water is pink
dawg, that's a date, looks like an olive to me
look, there's an apple! no it's not, it's a peach!
so fingerbang, pootie tang
burger king, gucci gang, dookie, dang
charlamagne gonna hate anyway
doesn't matter what i say
give me donkey of the day
what a way for 2018 to get underway
but i'm gonna say everything that i wanna say
welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
invite them in like a one a day
i'm not done (preach)
'cause i feel like the beast of burden
that line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'cause the way i see people turning's
is makin' it seem worthless
it's startin' to defeat the purpose
i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
and i was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
or still yet to be determined?
'cause i'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshiped
but if i could go back i'd at least reword it
and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent
sold the dream to that he's deserted
but i think it's workin'
end up running back into them all
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
bacardi and hen', never thought the party would end
one minute you're bodying shit, but then your audience splits
you can already sense the climate is starting to shift
to these kids you no longer exist
went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
to tiny drops, little drips
and by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
you start thinking of all the artists you dissed
all the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
for turning your fucking back on bizzy, kuniva and swift?
a freudian slip, subconsciously, i honestly wished
i ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
but it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
i just wish i had words, but i guess there just are none for this
to my partners, i can't say how sorry i am
this is not how i planned for our story to end
i love all of you men
but i just can't be the guy everybody depends
on for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
i will always be here, but that spark isn't there
and i don't know how to recapture that time and that era
i've tried hearkening back to, but i'm fighting for air
i'm barely charting myself
feels like i'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
to treat y'all like a stepping stone
though i ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
done all we possibly can, i know we kept our hopes up
but the longer we spend living this lie that we live
the less is left for closure, so let's let this go
it's not goodbye to our friendship, but d12 is over
i'ma wash away my sins
i'ma rinse away this dirt
i forgot to make amends
to all the friends i may have hurt
i better stop and say my grace
from it i pray that i don't fall
'cause on the way back down i may
end up running back into them all
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
i never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
tay keith, fuck these niggas up!

i ain't gotta dance long as my ferrari spyder move like c breezy
i don't gotta hire goons
i'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely

the maserati white and cool like geazy
while these dudes tryna figure out
how to do a freestyle as fly as me
i'm confused tryna figure out how to do kapri styles and mya g

we can not give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
possible couple of dollars you powder sniff
now you're slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
to dropped in the park in a pile of shit
knowledge is power, but powerless

'cause this bar is over your head
so you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrrt!)
oh, you run the streets, huh?
now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
this little cocksucker, he must be feelin' himself
he wants to keep up his tough demeanour
so he does a feature, decides to team up with n9na
but next time you don't gotta use tech n9ne
if you wanna come at me with a sub, machine gun
and i'm talkin' to you
but you already know who the fuck you are, kelly
i don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneakdiss
but keep commenting on my daughter hailie
i keep on telling you motherfuckers
but just in case you forgot really and need ja memories
jarred like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
i respond rarely, but this time shady 'bout to sound off
like a fuckin' cocked semiglock demigod
let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
nonthreatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
you're not ready, fool, break yourself like rock steady crew
obviously, i'm not gettin' through
we can get it poppin' like redenbach, lettin' off like remy ma
heavy artillery, godzilla, harsh with a hard shell
with a motherfucking heart bigger than bizarre's belly
only time you'll ever say i lost
you'll be talkin' 'bout fetty wap, better call diddy
just to try to get me off, and you better hope i don't call trick trick
bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
punk, you don't disrespect ogs, r.i.p. prodigy
sold dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
that i'll be the most hated, though made it
so that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'cause life is a bitch, she's a bowlegged ho
but now those days are over
i harvey weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
my code name is groper, i role play with lotion
i fuck the whole world then i throw away the trojan
old lederhosen with homemade explosives
i blow eighty holes in you
don't make me go in, i oj the flows and
i'm insult to injury, rolaids to goldman
i'm throat spray and motrin, i throated nicole
as they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
i doubleedge sword it 'cause one place i poke and
i stick and i turn in a rotating motion
invincible with the pen, i'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
i'm fuckin' these syllables, i let 'em lick on my genitals
i'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
a little bit unpredictable, i spit the formidable
that you bitches fuckin' with, the original
i consider me and nickel identical, but not us
the only thing we have in common is i'm a dick and you suck
otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
none come close to skunk, bug, soldier
tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
young thug poster, unplugged toaster!

2018, well (fack, fack)
yeah, i'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
you beat me, islamic nazi, that means there is no such thing
i've been goin' for your jugular since craig g duck alert
wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
i'll ride through your culdesac
window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
youyou collab on a referent rap, ii have never said his raps
ooverstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
and ruined your welcome mat
so spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
while i teabag the microphone 'cause i go nuts on it
like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
headed right at opponents and i'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
i'm 'bout to
smash into everyone, crash into everything
back and i've just begun, fack 2017
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone

damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
i'm a kamikaze, gonna
i turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when i wasn't (wasn't)
from the moment i heard rappers cussin', i was in (was in)
which is why i identify with the guy
who i was invented by, dre's frankenstein
energized like a nine volt, ice cold
like snake eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
but if the only reason i blowed is 'cause i'm white though
why don't every other white rapper sell what i sold? (ooh)
kamikaze pilot, i wrote my suicide note
here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'fore i jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'cause i'm takin' y'all with me when i go cyclone
i don't think this typhoon's lettin' up any time soon, here i go
eyes closed, blindfolded, i'm 'bout to
smash into everyone, crash into everything
back and i've just begun, fack 2017
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone
fack, fack on everyone

fack, fack on everyone
i'm a kamikaze, gonna

kamikaze, kamikaze
kamikaze, kamikaze, kamikamikaze
take a look at what i've done
i heard your freestyle on shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
there is no way we ever air that shit again, i guarantee that 
wait that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare reair it
shit's embarrassing, as me rearending tara reid bare
in my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of cher
each nut is the chair width of an acorn stairlift beware of me
lyrically i'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
richard ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is
wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
somethin' evil is lurkin', i'm no conspiracy theorist
but somethin' here is afootoh yeah, it's my dick
get the measuring stick (what?), twelve inches of wood
wait, but i've been goin' for your jugular since craig g duck alert
and i've come to pay respects
'cause if you sleep you're fuckedother words, you get laid to rest
and i hope your butt is hurt
put me on a track, i go cray on it like a color book
you got some views, but you're still below me
mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
and i don't say the hook unless i wrote the hook
and now i'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
and you know i've always spoke the truth
you're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
and it ain't somethin' i need a phone to do
when i say i can't wait 'til i get ahold of you
and i don't know what i'm s'posed to do
you know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months
it's too loud
maybe it's time i tell 'em what i think about them
can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
it's too loud
three's not a crowd all up in it, slow fire
don't fall on my face
don't fall on my faith, oh
don't fall on my fate
don't fall on my faith, oh
don't fall on my fate
don't fall on my
gotta concentrate, against the clock i race
got no time to waste, i'm already late, i got a marathoner's pace
went from addict to a workaholic, word to dr. dre
in that first marijuana tape guess i got a chronic case (yeah)
and i ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
i know this time paul and dre
they won't tell me what not to say (nope)
and though me and my party days
have all pretty much parted ways
you'd swear to god i forgot i'm the guy that made not afraid
one last time for charlamagne
if my response is late, it's just how long it takes
to hit my fuckin' radar, i'm so far away
these rappers are like hunger games
one minute, they're mockin' jay
next minute, they get their style from migos or they copy drake
maybe i just don't know when to turn around and walk away
but all the hate, i call it walk on water gate
i've had as much as i can tolerate
i'm sick and tired of waitin', i done lost my patience
i can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
you wanted shady? you got him!
don't fall on my face (yeah)
don't fall on my faith, oh
don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
don't fall on my faith, oh (rrr!)
don't fall on my fate (look)
somebody tell budden before i snap, he better fasten it
or have his body bag get zipped
the closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches
and don't make me have to give it back to akademiks
say this shit is trash again, i'll have you twisted
like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
even when i'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
lackin' with it, he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit
ho, you better go back and listen
you know me better, thinkin' i'll slow or let up
call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
hopin' that you rappers fall in that
dre said, hold your head up! kathy griffin
stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
this is how i shot ahead (pew) gabby giffords
my attack is vicious, jack the ripper, back in business
tyler create nothin', i see why you called yourself a (faggot), bitch
it's not just 'cause you lack attention
it's because you worship d12's balls, you're sackreligious
if you're gonna critique me
you better at least be as good or better
get earl the hooded sweater
whatever his name is to help you put together
some words, more than just two letters
the fans waited for this moment like that feature
when i stole the show (ha), sorry if i took forever (haha)
don't fall on my face (yeah)
don't fall on my faith, oh (i won't)
don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
don't fall on my faith, oh (ha)
don't fall on my fate (it's too easy)
just remember, i was here before you
and i'll be here after you make your runin for you
detractors, i might have to fuck pitchfork with a corkscrew
just what the doctor ordered
revenge is the best medicine
increase the dose, from least to most
and then tell the grammys to go and fuck themselves
they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
so they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to mc the show
every parasite needs a host (haha)
then give album of the year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
all i know is i wrote every single word of
everything i ever murdered
time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
and i got no faith in your writers, i don't believe in ghosts
when rap needed it most, i was that wing and a prayer
a beacon of hope, put a bird in the air
somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lipsyncs in the mirror
that's who i'm doin' it for, the rest i don't really even care
but you would think i'm carryin' a oxford dictionary in my pocket
how i'm buryin' these artists
on a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
and what's scary is you probably can compare me to your car 'cause i'm just barely gettin' started (woo)
and far as lord jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
or i'll show you an elvis clone
walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
put my feet up and just make myself at home
i belong here, clown, don't tell me 'bout the culture
i inspired the hopsins, the logics, the coles, the
seans, the kdots, the 5'9s, and oh
brought the world 50 cent, you did squat, piss and moan
but i'm not gonna fall... bitch!
it's too loud
can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
it's too loud
three's not a crowd all up in it
you're such a nice guy, a nice guy
you're faithful, you don't lie
after the club, you go back home right
riiight, psyyych!
suck my dick, you fucking suck man
suck my dick, you fucking suck man
i hope that your heart get hit by a semitruck
suck my dick, you fucking suck man
i hop in your whip and take a sip then i gun it
i don't, i don't got my self control, i hope that you running
i'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cumming
i don't, i don't got much self control, i hope that you running
i'm not a cheater, but if i'ma be accused, might as well be
you tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes but females be
rushin' me outside my telly, temptation overwhelms me
like my monthly bill from sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie
chargin' me, so i gave my hotel key
eh, i was tryna be nice
you're such a nice guy, a nice guy
you're faithful, you don't lie
after the club, you go back home right
riiight, psyyych!
suck my dick, you fucking suck bitch
suck my dick, you fucking suck man
i hope that your heart get hit by a semitruck
suck my dick, you fucking suck, bitch
i play your music while you suffer like i'm carmine coppola
you're tied up in the basement while i chill on your sofa
la prxima yo s que mejor me quedo sola
estas de buenas que yo ya vend mi pistola
i'm an emotional wreck, weak, everything over affects me
when you joke it upsets me, you say i'm no good at sex
and you think i'm gross and unsexy
i need scope 'cause my breath stinks
you hope that i choke on a pepsi
bitch you was supposed to correct me
been texting you since three, i still get no fucking reply
you say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
fuck you going in those knee high boots, cut it out bitch
i doubt that you're going to house sit in that outfit, and those skintight levi's
every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
you say don't come over 'cause you got pink eye
but i think i got just the thing
here we go again from heroes to villains
used to be your romeo but we both were jilted
a couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
but still it gave me hope that we'll get
through it together, a severed earlobe
mailed to you in an envelope would be dope
but what kind of lengths can you go?
pull a vincent van gogh, just to convince a damn ho
to be a housewife who outright lies
she's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
i ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
she's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
guys, when someone you'd die for
sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
another late night in, she stumbles through my door
lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
and i ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers
to plant the ky in i'm gettin' accused by a whore
who smells like st. ides and who's probably screwed five more
guys, sucked eightnine men
i'm takin' twobyfours to our eightbytens
bitch it's you i tore out the frame, i win
put up a new high score, beat this game i'm in
and here's some twoply for when you date my friends
in order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
when we renewed our vows, this the thanks i get?
i'm waitin' for the day i can
hear you say, marshall, what a skank i've been!
and there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him
got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
hurts me to my core, but the pain i'm in
after you, i swore to make the gray skies end
here come the rays, like when you get a pay hike and
am i the good guy or do i just play like him
and hope that he dumps you?
it's like a dream come true, just to scream fuck you!
guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
since
since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty
you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me
you can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
and i ain't in my feelings, i'm out but i let you say that you're the good guy
'cause this ain't what love looks like
you can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
i ain't in my feelings, i'm out but i let you say that you're the good guy
they like, you're the good guy, they like, they like
i got a song filled with shit for the strongwilled
when the world gives you a raw deal
sets you off 'til you scream, piss off! screw you!
when it talks to you like you don't belong
or tells you you're in the wrong field
when something's in your mitochondrial
'cause it latched on to you, like
knock knock, let the devil in
malevolent as i've ever been, head is spinnin'
this medicine's screamin', llllet us in!
llllike a salad bowl, edgar allan poe
bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
liquid tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
wicked, i get all high when i think i've smelled the scent
of elephant manurehell, i meant kahla
screw it, to hell with it, i went through hell with accelerants
and blew up mymymyself again
volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
mayo and went from hellmann's and being rail thin
filetofish, scribble jam, rap olympics '97 freaknik
how can i be down? me and bizarre in florida
proof's room slept on the floor of the motel then
dr. dre said hell yeah!
and i got his stamp like a postcard, word to melman
and i know they're gonna hate
but i don't care, i barely can wait
to hit them with the snare and the bass
square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
because they're gonna taste my
venom, (i got that) adrenaline momentum
and i'm not knowin' when i'm
ever gonna slow up and i'm
ready to snap any moment i'm
thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
they ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(wwwhen they get bit with the)

ever gonna slow up and i'm
ready to snap any moment i'm
thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
they ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(wwwhen they get bit with the)
i said knock knock, let the devil in
shotgun pppellets in the felt pen
cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
itit's evident i'm not done
vvenomous, the thoughts spun
like a web and you just caught in 'em
held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
beat strangler attack
so this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
like, what's her name's at the wheel? danica patrick
threw the car into reverse at the indy, a nut crashin'
into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
my mustang and the jeep wrangler grill
with the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and gandhi (gandhi)
translation, i will probably kill us both
when i end up backin' into ya
you ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to you
when you're bit with the
venom, adrenaline momentum
and i'm not knowin' when i'm
ever gonna slow up and i'm
ready to snap any moment i'm
thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
they ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(wwwhen they get bit with the)

(wwwhen they get bit with the)
i said knock knock, let the devil in
alien, eeelliott phone home

my fangs are in your throat, ho
you're snakebitten with myvenom
with the ballpoint pen i'm
gun cocked, bump stock, doubleaught, buckshot
tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like yung joc
'cause the doc put me on like sunblock
why the fuck not, you only get one shot
ate shit 'til i can't taste it
chased it with straight liquor
then paint thinner, then drank 'til i faint
and awake with a headache
and i take anything in rectangular shape
then i wait to face the demons i'm bonded to
'cause they're chasin' me but i'm part of you
so escapin' me is impossible
i latch onto you like aparasite
and i probably ruined your parents' life
and your childhood too
'cause if i'm the music that y'all grew up on
i'm responsible for you retarded fools
i'm the super villain dad and mom was losin' their marbles to
you marvel that? eddie brock is you
and i'm the suit, so call me
venom, (i got that) adrenaline momentum
and i'm not knowin' when i'm
ever gonna slow up and i'm
ready to snap any moment i'm
thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
they ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(wwwhen they get bit with the)

forearm feel like thor's arm in a gang war
you hear that yaowa, you know who finna file out
definitively finish you, my fist stick out that eyeball
piranha mentality with a jaws bite all night
coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight
jets and movers, cesspoolers, meth abusers
you step to us, text rugers to respect the shooters
my men think in sync, roll with the best crew
move to the beat of the same drum without lex luger
welcome to nay hood, bigger than jects, g
cheated death multiple times without riggin the deck
so i'm well prepped if you just want war
there'll be blood everywhere, you be laying on the louboutin floor
it's raw, you keep acting like you don't know mouse, nigga
and you gon' need the best doctors, house nigga
guard your jewels and avoid large tools
cause after i spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
they food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
need results from my actions, mistakes i'll exonerate
i'm martin king staring at a picture of obama's face
talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock
i don't need the key to the game, i pick a mean lock
you must be outta ya mind
you think you fucking with us
suck on these nuts
bitch hang it up, this game is over
takeoff, you invited inside of the mind of a psychotic rhymer
i'm kind of a dahmer, i'm grinding
now rappers are lining up jackers, i'm climbing up ladders
i buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
you liars and actors, i'm the genuine article
but read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles, particles
tell me when and i'm there
not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
stay fly like a limited fare
you got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
i smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from
you stepped on number two just to be number one
now i'ma step on you, bring it to yo yard
bogart for arts, we go hard
you frauds just blow hard like broads, i coast guard the west
i'm mozart, i compose dark shit with no heart
i got no jim beam in the liver
getting head like clean clippers, with haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
when i throw up 16's like i drink liquor
you think you seen sick? well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker
then i'll crack, and then i'll hop around in a hospital gown
popping the trunk, my pumper stay cocking the round
i shit logs and i piss river brown
cause i drink creek water and spit the river nile
and that's as close as i get to a pyramid
shit, they think i'm illuminati, so fuckin' ignorant
sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
but when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
they jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
skinnyass pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing
call me a clown, but you love where the clown's hanging
and the freakshow's at the county carnival then you pay
bitch, i'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
yelling go shady driving slower than an old lady
in an old '89, no piece if you pay me
gimme peace sign on my grill, no mercedes

that dirt road hit the 8 mile, the porno boys
and if marshall want me to clap, then homie, i deploy
game over
yo, i don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
i'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
patrolling corners
looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
i'm meaner in action
than rosco beating james tarteenyer (?)
and smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
i grew up in the wild hood
as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood
that i used as an excuse
and aint shit changed
but kept the same mindstate
since the third time that i failed 9th grade
you probably think that i'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
i don't promote violence i just encourage it
i laugh at the sight of death
as i fall down a cement flight of steps
and land inside a bed of spider webs
so throw caution to the wind
you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
shit, why not? blow your brain out
i'm blowing mine out
fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now
it's only fair to warn
i was born with a set of horns
and metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord
warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board
that smashed into your honda accord
with a 4 door ford
but i'm more toward droppin an accapella
and choppin' a fella
to mozarella
worse than a hellacopta propella
got you locked in the cella
with your skeleton showing
developing anorexia
while i'm standin next to ya
eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
with an iv in your veins
feeding you liquid darvicet
pumping you full of drugs
pull the plugs
on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
who were picked up in an ambulance
and driven
to receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
and given
a less than 20 percent chance
of living
have a possible placement
it's a hospital patient
storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
doctor kevorkian has arrived
to perform an autopsy on you while you scream i'm still alive!
driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
and pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
better call the fire department
i've hired a arson
to set fire to carpet
and burn up your entire apartment
i'm a liar to start shit (?)
got your bitch wrapped around my dick
so tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit
met a retarded kid named greg with a wooden leg
snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40
mixed up with alka seltzer and formula 44d
fuck an acid tab i'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
no more said case closed end of discussion
i'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion
leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
cross the bombas (?)
we blowin up your house killing your parents
and coming back to get your foster mommas
and i'm as good at keeping a promise as nostradamus
cause i aint making no more threats
i'm doing drivebys in tinted corvettes on vietnam war vets
i'm more or less sick in the head
maybe more cause i smoked crack (?)
today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath
walk the block with a labrador
strapit more corral for war than el salvador
foul style galore
verbal cow manure
coming together like the eyebrow on al b. sure
you probably gonna think that i'm talking about you and you goddamn right i am
look at you, this is the minimal i could diss you
subliminally, but i think criminal instinct
has pushed me to the brink, my pussy does it stink
he still loves me cause he puts me in his ink
he does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he?
nah, i'm just playing tug of war with his heart cause he misses me
i can still fuck him and leave him whenever i feel frisky
and there's no risk of disease cause he ain't with anyone is he?
this bitch really thinks she can get me
if she still wants me, driving across country
strapped him to the front seat, missing all the front teeth
thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me?
i told this cunt she's gonna overdo it once
and once she does, she'll  be stuffed up in a trunk
crunch, he scrunched her up in a ball
bunched up nice and comfy
fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
you cunning little cunt, deceitful witch
you thought you had me, 'till my shrink told me this
the problem is all inside your head she said to me
the answer is easy if you take it logically
i'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
there must be 50 ways to leave your lover
i feel like a serial killer
i keep dumping bodies in the lake, imma get caught and sent up the river
i shiver when i think of the company i keep
how do i know she ain't gonna kill me when i sleep?
i shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
sex kept us together, when we slept together everything
was all better, she made me feel like a king
slowly, she began lowering my selfesteem
she go to the club and not answer the phone when i call her
and i just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars
accused me of doing drugs and screaming holla
then i find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
and all i know is every time i go
to them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow
the little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
that's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago
and i wouldn't even let on like i know
what was i supposed to do, call her out on it? we just argue
say she put it down on purpose and flipped the whole script
ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch
a cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
she thought she had me, 'till my shrink told me this
the problem is all inside your head she said to me
the answer is easy if you take it logically
i'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
it's alright, it's ok, i'm gonna make it anyway
i'mma make it, i'mma make it, i'mma make it.., somehow
sometimes i just feel like, quitting i still might
why do i put up this fight, why do i still write
sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
sometimes i wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
and show these people what my level of skill's like
but i'm still white, sometimes i just hate life
something ain't right, hit the brake lights
case of the stage fright, drawing a blank like
daduhduhdada, it ain't my fault
great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
and i clam up (wham) i just slam shut
i just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, i have just been vicked
so i must then get off the bus then split
man fuck this shit yo, i'm going the fuck home
world on my shoulders as i run back to this 8 mile road
i'm a man, i'mma make a new plan
time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
time to really just take matters into my own hands
once i'm over these tracks man i'mma never look back
(8 mile road) and i'm gone, i know right where i'm going
sorry momma i'm grown, i must travel alone
ain't gon' follow no footsteps i'm making my own
only way that i know how to escape from this 8 mile road
i'm walking these train tracks, trying to regain back
the spirit i had 'fore i go back to the same crap
to the same plant, in the same pants
trying to chase rap, gotta move asap
and get a new plan, momma's got a new man
poor little baby sister, she don't understand
sits in front of the tv, buries her nose in the pad
and just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
while she colors her big brother and mother and dad
ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head
wish i could be the daddy that neither one of us had
but i keep running from something i never wanted so bad!
sometimes i get upset, 'cause i ain't blew up yet
it's like i grew up, but i ain't grow me two nuts yet
don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
the pressure's too much man, i'm just trying to do what's best
and i try, sit alone and i cry
yo i won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
that i don't pray to the sky, please i'm begging you god
please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
yo i hope you can hear me homie wherever you are
yo i'm telling you dawg i'm bailing this trailer tomorrow
tell my mother i love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
say whenever you need me baby, i'm never too far
but yo i gotta get out there, the only way i know
and i'mma be back for you, the second that i blow
on everything i own, i'll make it on my own
off to work i go, back to this 8 mile road
i'm a man, gotta make a new plan
time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
time to really just take matters into my own hands
once i'm over these tracks man i'mma never look back
(8 mile road) and i'm gone, i know right where i'm going
sorry momma i'm grown, i must travel alone
ain't gon' follow no footsteps i'm making my own
only way that i know how to escape from this 8 mile road
you gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
to be walking this borderline of detroit city limits
it's different, it's a certain significance
a certificate of authenticity, you'd never even see
but it's everything to me, it's my credibility
you never seen heard smelled or met a real mc
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
but yet i'm still unsigned, having a rough time
sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
go to work and serve mcs in the lunchline
but when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
who must i show, to bust my flow
where must i go, who must i know
or am i just another crab in the bucket
'cause i ain't having no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
maybe i need a new outlet, i'm starting to doubt shit
i'm feeling a little skeptical who i hang out with
i look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
at the salvation army trying to salvage an outfit
and it's cold, trying to travel this road
plus i feel like i'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
my defenses are so up, but one thing i don't want
is pity from no one, this city is no fun
there is no sun, and it's so dark
sometimes i feel like i'm just being pulled apart
from each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
it's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
sometimes i feel like a robot, sometimes i just know not
what i'm doing i just blow, my head is a stove top
i just explode, the kettle gets so hot
sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that i don't got
but i've learned, it's time for me to uturn
yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
ain't no fallin' no next time i meet a new girl
i can no longer play stupid or be immature
i got every ingredient, all i need is the courage
like i already got the beat, all i need is the words
got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
i am no longer scared now, i'm free as a bird
then i turn and cross over the median curb
hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 mile road
i'm a man, gotta make a new plan
time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
time to really just take matters into my own hands
once i'm over these tracks man i'mma never look back
(8 mile road) and i'm gone, i know right where i'm going
sorry momma i'm grown, i must travel alone
ain't gon' follow no footsteps i'm making my own
yo, it's time to get rid of this coward once and for all.
i'm sick of the motherfucker! check this shit out!

fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer,
fuck everybody
fuck y'all if you doubt me
i'm a piece of fucking white trash, i say it proudly
and fuck this battle, i don't wanna win, i'm outty,
this guy's a choke artist, ya catch a bad one
you're better off shooting yourself with papa doc's handgun
climbing up this mountain, you're weak
i'll leave you lost without a paddle, floating shit's creek
you ain't detroit, i'm the d, you're the new kid on the block
'bout to get smacked back to the boondocks
fucking nazi, your squad ain't your type
take some real advice and form a group with vanilla ice
and what i tell you, you better use it
this guy's a hillbilly, this ain't willie nelson music
trailer trash, i'll choke you to your last breath
and have you looking foolish
like cheddar bob when he shot himself
silly rabbit, i know why they call you that
'cause you follow future like he got carrots up his ass crack
and when you acting up that's when you got jacked up
and left stupid like tina turner when she got smacked up
i'll crack your shoulder blade
you'll get dropped so hard that elvis will start turning in his grave
i don't know why they let you out in the dark
you need to take your white ass back across 8 mile to the trailer park
this guy raps like his parents jerked him
he sounds like erick sermon, the generic version
this whole crowd looks suspicious
it's all dudes in here, except for these bitches
so i'm a german, eh?
that's okay, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids
these leaders of the free world rookies
lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies
talkin' 'bout shits creek

you're still gonna sink, you're a disgrace
yeah, they call me rabbit, this is a turtle race
he can't get with me, spitting this shit wickedly
lickety shot suspicious spickety split lickety
so i'ma turn around with a great smile
guess who's back?!?!
mommy! we're home!!
say hello to my little friends
dj muggs, soul assassins, cypress hill
everybody! put your hands where my eyes can see!!!
everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
fourty fifty samoans, they knowing when dbo was
50, tweezy, obie there won't be no ho in us
they pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
from new york down to texas, back up to los angeles
we've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
you may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
it's funny, i guess money does have its advantages
and it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
it's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
it's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
we just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
you fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
that you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
no one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
and they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
the noise from clips and rounds be drowned out by the crowd
and you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
till the club closes, and clears out
and that's when they see you flatened
nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping
and you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
it ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off
and it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off
shit about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
we ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
shit just ain't the same, when the aks gettin' sprayed cause
hiphop is in a state of 911
it ain't about hiphop, cause those days are gone
it ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
it's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
cause hiphop is in a state of 911
step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious
all theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
thinking you coming with heat, yo son, i'm curious
how long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
we living for real and others just making the stories up
illusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
if you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
when you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none
i'm like a rolling stone homie, i got you under my thumb
silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
we cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
dealing with the giant goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon
shit about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
we ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
shit just ain't the same, when the aks gettin' sprayed cause
hiphop is in a state of 911
it ain't about hiphop, cause those days are gone
it ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
it's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
cause hiphop is in a state of 911
uh, gangsta ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
on this shit you call hiphop, this function is where did it
when i  put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
my appetite for destruction is blasted because i said it
got you  stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
but you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
when you  enter the business you thinking you running shit
you witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
we gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
all these  imitators parading like they some playas
trying to  save hiphop the task is something greater
cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
get caught, i'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
i'm riding a  gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
i'm in a  full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
on an 8 mile mission with cypress and o.g.'s
shit about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
we ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
shit just ain't the same, when the aks gettin' sprayed cause
hiphop is in a state of 911
it ain't about hiphop, cause those days are gone
it ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
it's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i was praying that you and me might end up together.
it's like wishing for rain as i stand in the desert,
but i'm holding you closer than most'cause you are my heaven.
how you listen to a girl that still wanna man
tell me the truth is that a man or juwanna mann
i'm wonderin' why she ret to go like wanda then
when we met you was a v like madonna, man

mcnabb before you get in a cab

and that's why
a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i was praying that you and me might end up together.
it's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i was praying that you and me might end up together.
so young, so full of life and vibrant,
side by side wherever you was ridin', i went,
so close almost was some bonnie and clyde shit,
when ronnie died you was right by my side,
with a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,
and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it,
you even had the same type of childhood i did,
sometimes i just wanna know why,
is it that you surcame to yours,
and mine i survived it,
you ran the streets i nine to fived it,
we grew up, grew apart as time went by us,
then i blew up to both yours and mine surprises,
now i feel the vibe i just cant describe it,
much as your pride tries to hide it,
you're cold your touch, its like ice,
and your eyes is the look of resentment,
i can sense it and i don't like it
a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i was praying that you and me might end up together.
it's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i was praying that you and me might end up together.
uh, stuck alone in this wave race
say i'm living too fast, don't plan on changing my pace
got one foot on the gas, it's never a need for brakes
smoke ezrider's with hash, fuck bitches from out of state
valet bringing my cars, waiter bringing me plates
shrimp and fillet mignon, we celebrate buying drinks
wit a couple of broads my nigga's who got love for me
it's lonely at the top, i'm tired of having company
uh, so while you busy trying to fit in, i'm a stand out
and view my life through this lens to see how it pan's out
substitute teacher ass nigga's, need a handout
middle finger screaming fuck them nigga's who hated,
i'm money affiliated
pop another bottle, that chronic smokin degraded
speculating me landing must of got me mistaken,
i'm speaking as the captain of the planes,
you's a runner on the jet way
a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i was praying that you and me might end up together.
it's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather,
i stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
they call me slim roethlisberger
i go bezerker than a fedup postoffice worker
a merk her with a mossberg
i'm pissed off get murdered
like someone took a ketchup squirter
squirted a frankfurter
for a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
when you saw the chainsaw get to waving
like a terrible towel
i faced her around
but his fangs come out
get your brains blown out
that's what i call blowing your mind
when i come back
like nut on your spine
i'm a thumb tack

defiance, giant scrotum

i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breath whenever you gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted
i'm back for revenge
i lost a battle that ain't happening again
i'm at your throat like strep
i step, strapped with a pen
metaphors wrote on my hand,
someone distorted my mint
read some i wrote on a napkin
i do what i have to to win
pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
not even austin powers, how the fuck are they mike meyers
and tell that psycho to pass the torch
to the whack before i take a shit in his jackolantern
and smash it on his porch
now get off my dick
dick's too short a word for my dick
get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick
you call me the champ call me the space shuttle destroyer
i just blew up the challenger, matter fact i need a lawyer
i displaced my clause with enough plaster
to make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
you're the eminem backwards, you're minime
see he's in a whole nother weight class
he smokes your bb's you beat back bullets
you're full of it you were just in his cd's
left at infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
no peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
his new slim shady ep's got the attention of the mighty d. r. e
i'm haunted i'm dead your gone

i put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
i'm telling the truth, i got a price on my head too, cause when you..
it's sad cause the bad guys always die
slim grabbed the shotgun (dre here's the plot)
and we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
hollow tips started flying every which way
i grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled
{just let it gooo!}
why else would i kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?
{just do it!}
fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!
{just do it!}
but the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch!
welcome to detroit
this is the bet shady 2.0 cypher 2011
myself, slaughterhouse and yelawolf
white dog, get em!
put these muthafuckas in a box and i send em away
put 'em in a gray 'lac and pop the trunk
hey throw 'em in the back, jack, i dig 'em a grave
put a brick inside that xerox, when i print 'em a page
moving keys i can't relate, cause i live in a cage
i throw up the a, i take 'em to school,
i give em a grade, an easy e for effort
that's wwa, white with an attitude
alphabet soup is on my plate
all i got is z's they sleeping on me, i can't get 'em awake
i spoon feed them the sound in a room full of deceivers and clowns
who believe they making it rain cause all they see is the clouds
and i watch from the couch of the vip
like a potato with a bunch of meatheads like fuck it
i just feed em a cow
plenty of white boys to pick from this year
but before you can pick a pepper, you better pick up your heater
cause even peter piper could pick up a mic
but what it's like to pick a fight with me
it's like putting nikes on a cheetah, betta speed up
or at least in my case addidas
i'm out this bitch drinking sprite by the 2 liter
holler, shady records
say i'm from the new school, i'ma say check ya tone and watch ya mouth
if they teaching how to dougie, i'm condoning dropping out
forced to wile, y'all birthed and gave me up
i just perfected being hip hops foster child, now check it
i don't blame y'all for being trash fans and copping it
the radio's the crime scene the masses are the hostages
in my youth i'd throw shots, the fan would dodging it
i'm grown, i ain't watching the throne, i'm sabotaging it
you see that four headed monster and the storm looms
snipe 'em from a distance, the scope got a long zoom
you super mario thugs is in the wrong room
got a figure here you won't get bigger if you on shrooms
was left to me i'd revive what the game be 'bout
i'da took the wine outta amy house
enough raps from you scrub cats about cocking a snub back
wayne couldn't teach me how to love that
but i got this shit from uptown, she my summer bunny
both parents broke but she comes from money
think my bread is her paper to burn
so i lock her out and now she doubt david is stern
she so bad i make her hit the telly from a taxi
then dead her in that holiday inn
learnt that from max b
that's why the haters of every kind wanna send me llamas
i made it right before they eyes like i was benihanas
is it me? or is what i'm hearing just pitiful?
airwaves the same now the stereo's typical
my skin thick so the critics ignore
so unafraid to die you think i did it before
the boys rodman with the trash talk
magical walk with the black ball way i bounce off the asphalt with cat paws
glass jaw, hoody and mask would be the black folk with no passport
body be found in the mansion in one of my trap doors
if pumps had awards ya status whore category
probably be that of awards 'tween michael rappaport and kenny lattimore
i know hip hops alive and well
if it died, you other crews wouldn't survive the smell
(ladies &amp gentlemen... you're scared now)
(make that face at 'em dawg)
(crooked i.. get 'em)
i spot a victim, the plot'll thicken when the clock is tickin'
i caught em slippin', i gotta give em a shot, i hit em with proper spittin'
hottest writtens and compositions, so competition's a contradiction
somebody mentioned they got it crooked, highly fiction,
we probably different, got gotti henchmen,
opposition our body quick as bugatti engines
i'm on a mission to get richer,
the sickest lyric kicker diggin' a ditch for different spitters
sweet lyricists get disfigured, sip liquor
spit like a sick mixture
of notorious pun and l get the big picture
the poster i'll roast ya,
my mind so deadly it's just like the beanie is close to a holster
it's over control my whole coastal region like i'm supposed to
flow is going postal evening, open season
heart close to freezing, ruthless is easy nigga
approach i'm squeezing, believe me
dopest west coaster  breathing
so most y'all hope i'm vegan, no pun, beefing
rappers need to keep it trill
give me a beat to kill too many people still eating sleeping pills
people sleeping on my ether skills
and y'all ain't even real
we about to die in this cypher
before you die you should do the jada and leave a will
foreal
yaooowa
i ain't a rap dude, i'm a dude who rap
before this i was moving crack
killers y'all become when y'all rhyme, i salute and dap
and if i blink then remove ya snaps, you ain't cool you wack
with ya foolish yac's? skinny jeans don't mean ya ass shoot
it means ya booty claps
don't play like tyler perry, this the slaughterhouse of pain
flow brown, tight and heavy
when it comes to sixteen's i'm a fiend feinding a studio
near a needle with a mean lean, probably writing bars to nas thief theme
getting my yaowa on, may all the olajuwon's be the dream team
this is an all day slaughter
they feindin for us to break like beyonce's water
the four quarters doing all the eating
and you gotta know why i made the cut, i'm puerto rican
ortiz keep the fire ready
and tryna put me out's like tryna steal a transvestite from eddie
i'm do or die dope
and you can make the sticker sittin' on the door
of that phantom your suicide note
hi rihanna..
is nicki living with you? let me know
so i can buy binoculars and telescopes
hi rihanna..
i don't need to know you better
you tell me you love my music again, we go together
bye rihanna...
now back to y'all fools
we rock out like the outside of a guitar school
thousand dollar frames, i prefer to see the world through
don't ask me nothing bout budden, i beat my girl too
you ask me why do i keep her? i say it's cheaper to
that's why i ride around in a rolls like wiz khalifa do
rappers, i'm your daddy, i tell you straight as this
you don't kill but your father will like jaden smith
i tell ya like i tell my spanish chick
you fly but i ain't going down on no landing strip
so get your wax on like danielson
or i'ma have to run like de la hoya in drag when cameras come
point out the greatest rapper alive i headshot 'em
smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom
bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
while i'm cyber sexing with jessica alba, via skype
i'm on my dboy, dbo thing
spiritual steelo swing like ceelo green
get out the camera with yo b roll bling
you know your flow is whack
we cornered the market like a walmart in a culdesac
yeah, this what 2 million singles sold and a album that's gold
look like, without having to sell your soul
nickle
wait, can i rap?
(you da boss, you better get 'em)
ayo... lyrical miracle spiritual individual criminal subliminal
in your swimmin' pool
(boo.. come on man, get back on.. kick that shit)
you 'bout to see peace destroyed
it'll never be restored
when i unleash these beastly hoards on your cd stores
wanna stop it, you gon' need a priest and at least three swords
a license to ill from the beastie boys, 3 ouija boards
and a squeegee and please be warned don't ask for the squeegees for
or the holy water, acid rap that'll eat these floors
eat a hole in a rhyme book, you see these horns?
and as for me, you ask when i'm gone will he be mourned?
is puke luke warm? should casey anthony do porn?
can that chick fit a newborn dead baby inside a freakin' shoebox
with a shoehorn, smothered in chloroform so she can go get her groove on?
can she duct tape and velcro a fetus? joell yo,
tell joe i need his empty box from his old shell toe adidas
so i can put these babies in the fetal position,
they're getting elbows to the penis
yeah, big deal. i took some little kids big wheel
and spit in his fricken big kids meal
quit tryna bite me and pinch, you wench, sit still
you just put your six inch heel through my benz windshield?
is it dust we bout to kick up?
can yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup?
between a stick shift in his fricken pick up
and drink like a hick, redneck, hillbilly will till he gets hiccups?
flippin' the script up like mike vick
get bit in his junk by a pit, yup i'm a sick pup
i'd be a horrible magician
cause i'd fuck that trick up
fix ya lips up to say something fly, or zip up
ab? let's c. you said you were gonna do xyz
till you fuck around and get dropped like an e
when you add an ing
don't put a k in front of that though, when i mc
cause i'm not the king of this microphone booth
it's more like a phonebooth
superman in this bitch, kryptonite won't do
it gives me more power, i bump the fat boys and
eat rat poison, take meteor showers
fresh outta the mental hospital and me not flossing a middle finger
while i hop in a mosh pit, will be like nas doing gospel or r&b, you crazy?
me pushing up daisies? that thought is impossible
as if flashing across the news, posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
with a huge johnson, boobs, and a monstrous tube of lube
and a bra, some boots, some panties, in an aqua blue mazda
swallowing a popsicle, playing tonsil pool
so kill the rumors it ain't happenin'
(feat. dj buttafingaz)<span>
sneakin in through the back door, fruity mc's get ambushed 
rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed 
then i'm movin on down from the right to left 
so bite the meth or prepare to fight to death 
to get jacked, attacked and cracked in two 
smackin through 'til youre black and blue for actin true 
i'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands 
proof that i be sniffin on aerosol cans 
i'm stompin, i'm kickin, i'm chokin, i'm stampin em 
clompin em, stickin, and pokin and clampin em 
to electric chairs and tightenin bolts 
hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts 
i'm zappin, rappers, singers, and dancers 
faster than you could snap your fingers for ransom 
cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathin 
survivin by connivin and theivin 
i had a dream i was gettin jacked by biters 
it felt like i was bein attacked by spiders 
developin a fear of biterphobia 
i'm holdin a gas can and lighter over ya 
if i detect ya, i'ma pulverize 
dissect your brain, diggin in your skull for lies 
and i'ma torture, with material iller 
than a stark ravin mad serial killer 
i'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is 
a major risk to a plagiarist 
so beware of the aura, a terror for the horrible 
will scare ya tomorrow, is the airbourne assault of the rappers 
hit the source to better my skills, 
i head for the border 
and run the galloping hills, the choice is yours 
cause now buddy's noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse 
cause i'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage yours to bite like labradors 
in the range of my doublebarrel 
and your life is in danger, trouble, and peril 
i trample and stamp liars, like they were campfires 
cuz vampires right on my balls like clamp pliers 
and swing on my big thingamajig 
so i'm bringin my nig proof for backup when i sing at my gig 
cause biters are fallin head over heels 
in love with every rhyme that i've said over reels 
that's how i became paranoid 
chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed 
cause every time you bit it was deliberate 
so i'm forced to hit a little quicker with 
an ultimatum i assault and slayed em 
with rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em 
energetic and imaginative, 
pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives 
will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10 
that's why i'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen 
boy meets girl
you were my dream my world
but i was blind
you cheated on me from behind
'cause boy meets girl

jumped out of the 2nd floor of a record store
with a treacherous four cassette and a cassette recorder
in ecuador with edward norton
witness the metamorphosis
of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
from the hessian war and
hence the origin of the headless horseman
born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
endless source and reservoir
of extension cords in dresser drawers
and deadbolts on the bedroom doors
and sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
excellent boyfriend
use intercourse to settle scores
with women who have been vendettas towards men
dickhead is forced in 'til there's shredded foreskin
reddish torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
bed sores and sore shins
pregnant whores can get abortions
fetish for stickin' metal forks in, selfabsorption
skeletor, i went to hell and fell a floor
a predator, i'm headed for competitors
better warn 'em, what i lack in tact and a set of morals
i make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
stegosaurus, chuck norris with a thesaurus
yes, of course, a mess of warrants
you want some? come and get some, boys!
i'm givin' daniel pantaleo a refresher course
on excessive force and pressure points
and dressin' george zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
dress and four inch heels to address the court
with a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso
or left on the doorsteps of trayvon's dad as a present for him
in my present form i'm desert storm
appetite for destruction there's no suppressant for
aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
unpleasant, horrible hello, gorgeous!
the rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
met a contortionist, said, when you wanna get sexual?
she said, however i fit in your schedule. i'm flexible.
expired tags on the saturn, got catherine bach
in the back in daisy dukes with the hazards on
at a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
for this asshole cop's daughter
laugh 'cause i called her a brat on it
he spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
had a heart attack and dropped dead
started fallin' back with it
and got slapped with a colin kaepernick practice sock
one ball and half a dick, apple watch
crack front axle, walked in a bass pro shop with david hasselhoff, pulled tabasco sauce out of my satchel
knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*
asked if they had a laughin' stock
that was fuckin' stupid
you got it twisted, all 'cause i offered this bitch
a doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
bitch, get to massagin' this dick!
like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
it's not a bitch on this earth i can be monogamous with
she's nonexistent
robin thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit
but i shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
misfit, blond and nitwit
like i've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
screamed, i hate blondes, and became one, i'm optimistic
love to start shit
shovin' clark kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
of the bucket, bumpin' bubba sparxxx
i'm double parkin' up at targets, trouble 'causer, a double crosser
shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
a couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
same damn brain scan results as rainman's is
something's off, but when dustin hoffman's
dressin' up in your mummy costume
on stage dancin' to brain damage, what's the problem?
nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
run the faucet, i'ma dunk
a bunch of trump supporters underwater
snuck up on 'em in ray bans in a gray van with a spray tan
it's a wrap, like an ace bandage
don'tgiveafuck persona, to my last dna strand
e&ampj in the waistband, at the vmas with the stagehand
she wants kielbasa, prearrange an escape plan
threeinch blade on point, like a seeandsay
consider me a dangerous man
but you should be afraid of this dang candidate
you say trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
and that's what you wanted
a fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
who doesn't have to answer to no onegreat idea!
if i was president
gettin' off is the first order of business
once i get in office
second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to uncle sam
naked, laughin', dick cupped in hand
screamin', fuck safe sex!
throw a latex and an aids test at him
tell congress i run this land
and i want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
addiction to friction and static
addict who can't escape the habit
continue to chase the dragon
but as fate would have it, i walked up in major magics
dressed as the maintenance man
in a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
with a gauge to blast it
and sped away in the station wagon
stacey dash's and casey anthony's
crazy asses in the backseat
throwin' stayfree pads at me
dead passenger in the passenger seat
unfasten the safety latches
and slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
i snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
'finna get a murder case and catch it
like you threw it at me encased in plastic
and send dylan roof through the windshield of the benz
until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin'
and skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
swing for the fence like prince fielder
knock it into the upper peninsula
you wanna go against 'zilla? the rap god
when will i quit? never been realer
the instiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
whose pens iller than prince in a chinchilla
or ben stiller in a suspense thriller
revenge killer, avenge syllable binge
fill a syringe, 'til i
draw first blood
even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
couldn't be more awkwarder
cause you're innocence i robbed you of
it's my fingers that got stuck up
taught ya ta, not give a
slapstick, hockey puck
the broad hunter with the sawed off
like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
but i'm not gonna, get the shotgun
or the glock, i'm gonna opt for the ox
cause i'm into objects that are sharp when i shop
and it's not a shock, i'm such an obnoxious fucker
the rock hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought
this much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of vivica fox with a box cutter
that was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
i'm unrevealin' quickly
my squabbles, i'm grappling with your time traveling with me
try and follow, as i wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
tip it back then i'm twisting wine bottles
like what happened to chris reeves' spine column
that's the plan of attack when i'm fixing my problems
wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
but the fact that i have so many rappers against me mind boggles
and why i haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is
more of a spectacular mystery than a fucking agatha christie crime novel
but my patience is wearing thin
swear i been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til i smear it in
diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
and never appear again
if you actually had fuckin' careers to end
but then i think of molly qerim and i steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
molly, i'm gone off you
man, light some kush
you're my first take, i'll nail you
can't lie, i gush
if i won you over, you would be the grand prize
i'm entranced by your looks, come and give the shady franchise a push
you can get it in the can like some anheuser busch
jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
mushed against your damn side, your puss
and thighs are squished
what kind of attires that?
i'm ready to be rode
psychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat
light the match to ignite the wrath
got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
piper chapmans might just have to picket me
like a scab
hard to describe in fact
startling violent perhaps
are things that come to mind as soon as i start spitting rhymes like that
and you aren't really surprised at that
but as far as these lines i rap
and these bars, wouldn't dial it back if i star 69ed the track
2 chainz!
yeah, yeah

i'm at your throat, i'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (hell yeah)
bin laden with a pen, bodyin' again
i begin slaughterin' your men, prolly shoulda been
ali or the svengali embodiment of sin
like a saudi in the taliban plotting an event
in the lobby of the intercontinental with an obvious intent
and i would not even relent
up on a little like osama with a bomb under the bin
and down the middle of the pentagon
and hit a kindergartener with a rental (stop!)
back and forth, back and forth
like jack kevorkian's ass to court
rap mature! why can't you be like macklemore? (huh?)
why you always gotta smack a whore? (huh?)
it's likely the psychiatric ward's a last resort (huh?)
something's gotta give, that's for sure
yet you keep comin' back for more
not as raw as i was, 'walk on water' sucks
bitch, suck my dick!
y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit 'fore you heard it
so you formed your verdict
while you sat with your arms crossed
did your little reaction videos and talked over songs (chill!)
nah dog, y'all sayin' i lost it?
your fuckin' marbles are gone (wait, em!)
but nowadays, every flow, every cadence sound the same (skrrt)
brain's a powder keg, i draw inspiration outta hate
real pain in the paper, i don't trace
but if i look strange and outta place
it's 'cause i'm an alien, that's why i write 'til the page is outta space
yeah, from 7 mile in novara
to how can i be down?, all of us tryna pile in the car (yeah!)
we shot for the stars (yeah!)
'cause we only got so much time in this world (yeah!)
so rewind it to your high school dance to the night before
if you think you're promised tomorrow (yeah!)
now i'm 'bout to fool again
this tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit
a freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip
and i'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your hooters chick
if i was you, i wouldn't do nothin' stupid due to the mood i'm in
i'm losin' it, you get chewed like a junior mint
show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed
empty the lubricant and put super glue in it (woo!)
how many fuckin' rappers did i go through?
dispel doubt, but you won't admit i smoked
and you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit
but am i s'posed to sound like everything else out?
'cause i don't get compared to it, only myself now
and i can see the fairweather fans and sales down
but the only way i care is if i let myself down
but what the fuck have i woke to?
time to eat the vocals and shit out pro tools
i know you still want me to ill out, don't you?
hopin' the old slim's gonna spill out, open
fire on your whole camp with this spit, i roast you
so chill out, no, you
hoes couldn't roast me with the shit i wrote you
then i took a stand
went at tanface and practically cut my motherfuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you
you just called my shit trash?
thank god, i rap better when the odds are stacked
revival's wack, i don't like the 'zombie' track
and when he's talkin' that garbage psychotic crap
where's your content at?
what's with all the conscious rap?
p!nk, beyonc this and kehlani that (yeah!)
i just add it to the fuel in my rocket pack
'til i'm ready to respond, then i'ma launch it at 'em
idiotic from the fuckin' embryonic sac
to the body bag, i'll be back
and when i am, i'll be at your fuckin' throat like
i have no idea what i'm doing

rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser

peared i was hiding in freeway's beard, just a
hop skip and a jump from my skin, gushing
nails into my face that i been pushing

sucker like a vicegrip, my pen put ya

uh, so selena williams, just like my dad talks about more john dick'n,
this girl talkin' how she pregrent, she crazy, so later i crushed that hoe, and left baby,
and never trust her, no shit! even she specialize in massaging on my testicles, 
and i never trust her, a whole lot, even on the first date, she basically get her mouth rimmed,
and turn around and ask me for a kiss, no bitch i'm straight, 
and i never really get concerned how my own dick tastes,

ye, ye! i think i'm about to slip on my swag juice.
slim is in the house, simmer down there sister
bound to get you dizzy cause he gets as busy as a
bee, baby you can throw a frizbee in a blizzard

oh
this game's like cocaine
i want this more than anything in the world
ha, so do i. at least i thought i did.
got to have it
yeah, i made it
i'm addicted
yeah, i'm feigning
this is a beat with no words at first
it's a blank painting
exercising the mind is brain strength training
starts off with something, like shady's an insane maniac,
yeah, slim shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?
now all you need's an image to go with the name, baby
wife beaters and white tshirts, hanes mainly
it's a long shot, but is it possible there's a lane, maybe?
if not, he's gonna have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
he wants the fame so bad he can taste it
he could see his name up in lights
women screaming his fuckin' name, fainting
shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
joe schmoe made it, he took his plain jane lady and his baby hailie out the trailer
but he ain't trailing anymore, he's ahead of the race
while maintaining his innocence
little does he know, his train is derailing
and he's about to be raped by this game anally
what would you do for a little bit?
what would you give for a little hit?
for that c.o.c.a.i.n.e.
'cause once you get in, you don't wanna leave
got to have it
yeah, i made it
i'm addicted
yeah, i'm feigning
you're operating on all cylinders
syllables spit like dillinger's spilling ya guts
people are feeling ya mic skills, but these haters are ice grillin' ya
willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
fake friends'll kill for ya, die for ya
but you can't decipher why? for the life of ya
it wasn't like this when you were cypherin'
argue wit' your wife again
she found vicodin in your pants last night again
your dispute's public, nothing is private anymore
oh, and your best friend? say byebye to him
what kinda apple you take a bite'a, slim?
(this is what you wanted marshall, ain't it?)
fuck no!
the way that it turned out was nothin' like the picture that i painted in my head
sometimes a dream to make it, it's more fun than it is to actually make it
the game stripped me naked
it robbed me ever having another real relation
ship, with another girl
this world is a fuckin' trip
cause i slip in another world, proceed, take another hit
sniff 'til i fuckin' hurl, tell em all to fuckin' sit
and spin 'til they fuckin' twirl, middle finger up again
relapsing back in this game
oh well, fuck it, then
what would you do for a little bit?
what would you give for a little hit?
for that c.o.c.a.i.n.e.
'cause once you get in, you don't wanna leave
got to have it
yeah, i made it
i'm addicted
yeah, i'm feigning
start off right
just to see your name in lights
just so you can live the life
you take a bite
and lose your sight
they call this (fame)
you think you good (ha ha)
just cause you got out the hood
concerned only with getting dough,
no longer poor but lost your soul they call this.. (fame)
i hear it callin'
my name is callin'
why you strugglin'
when you could be ballin'
my head is sayin' yeah
but my feet is stallin'
so many walk in
but any fallin'
but i got to have it
like eve and the apple
she had to grab it
i got to take it
i got to make it
that's the plan
and i can't forsake it.
what would you do for a little bit?
what would you give for a little hit?
for that c.o.c.a.i.n.e.
'cause once you get in, you don't wanna leave
got to have it
yeah, i made it
i'm addicted
yeah, i'm feigning
('cause once you get in, you don't wanna leave)
guess i can't leave then
guess i'm addicted
in my mind i'ma fighter, my heart's a lighter
my soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
arsenic writer, author with arthritis
carpel tunnel, marshall will start shititis
hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed
dick headed, a prick, a big headache i'm sick
quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics.
who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
this dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
some lunatic lit it and it's not nelly
do not tell me to stop yelling, when i stop selling i quit
so stop dwelling an i am not felling
you fuckers are not ready, cause i got jelly, like beyonce's pot belly
this is destiny, yes money i'm of running
so get off of me, i'm not slowing or softening
they sendin armies out to bomb me, constantly armed
the only dj that can calm me is constantly armed
my firepower keep me warm i'm constantly armed
and fuck the world til i'm gone, constantly armed
they sendin armies out to bomb me, constantly armed
the only dj that can calm me is constantly armed
my firepower keep me warm i'm constantly armed
and fuck the world til i'm gone bitches be warned
i will not fall,
i will stand tall,
feels like no one can beat me. 
follow me tell me if you feel me 
i think niggaz is tryin to kill me 
picturin pistols, spittin hollow points til they drill me 
keepin it real, and even if i do conceal 
my criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin steel 
see niggaz is false, sittin in court, turned snitches 
that used to be real, but now they petrified bitches 
i'm tryin to be strong, my firepower keep me warm
i'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world til i'm gone, bitches be warned.
word is bonb, you'll get torn
i'm bustin on guiliani, he rubbin my niggaz wrong 
and then it's on, before i leave picture me

bet it make these jealous niggaz mad i said it 
this thug life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes 
fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do', with fo
other man!
i stand in slapped by the wind as i begin
do you know who i am? and many reply with a grin
yes, i'm tired of being obtruded
why should i be secluded? i've got a brand new horn to be tooted
to sum it up in a nutshell, eminem will you kick it for me?
so i find myself in a certain obligatory
a place that i dwell in, fell into some wonderful productions
to make up for lost time, and then it brings obstruction
finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
a mental projectile, i aim at the reptile
i look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?
is there a reason for this? the hindrance is aggravating
how many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
there's so much more to learn and pages left to be read
so put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
while i hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty thor
words can weigh a ton
therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one
yeah, it's another
very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side
but i see no borderline, from under this colorblind
and some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred
but then i'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
wrong, the world would never endure to arguing
awaking to the absence of unity is startling
oh foolish pride, what the hell are you trying to do?
you cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to
your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable
so how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
you're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless
damn, you're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this
straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
the date of my birth on the earth, the deliverance of a starchild
blessed with formidable talent and versatility
but with such a power, there comes a responsibility
to infringe on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear
to form an alliance is something even the giants fear
so instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
refusal of usin' is accepted now it's a trend
yeah, it's another...
you know i don't understand why we all just can't get along
you hate me but you know me and what i stand for
no. so then why do you speak for me
and every other white man when you that we're your enemy?
on the floor lies a broken door, cause i'm not to be spoken for
stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
rarely do you see the lighter side of me
i try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
but <i>[?]<i> is isolated, apologies are exhausted
feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
who can i trust after repeatedly being shafted
switch to the opposite, now scenes are being reenacted
pull up that boy by his roots, destroy him quick
his fracture's obviating, we hate him, his patterns past us, huh
always fighting for the position of top dog
that spot's already occupied, and i don't play leapfrog
cause i do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
but i'm always having to prove myself, time after time
oh how i never understand how a man could be outcast
judged from the past and he's put last
and others with nothing to say
stutterin' and slurrin' and mutterin' words with no meaning attack be signin' like danny kaye
here i go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
and eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
yo, alright, yo
i'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while i'm sleeping
i keep dreaming of death and i'm hearing people screaming
the devil's spirit's trapped inside me and i want it out
i'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
with both of my wrists slit, i'm lifted up in the air
and suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
i feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death
but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
tripping over od'd bodies of dead lushes
bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
door's open and close by themselves, books fly off shelves
curtains catch fire, the house melts
my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
caught a piece of shrapnel in the adam's apple
two cups of holy water and i'm looking at 'em half full
but as soon as i go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
it got silent, then all these voices said
come follow me into the pits of hell
i heard 'em yell welcome to the norman bates motel!
i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother
covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
i said i need a room so i could try to get some rest
she gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
and told me that's just for starters, satan'll be in to see me later
fuck an intro man, let's go.
i come around like what goes around
what goes up must come down
anyone who comes up must go down
might as well go for the gusto now
better not let up, better not let them breathe
last shot give it all you got
try to turn me down bitch get fucked with a volume knob, fuck all you snobs
hoes i hope all you rot
2 bottles of lubriderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought?
and you wanna menage a trois you twats
fuck that i'd rather turn this club to a bar room brawl
get as rowdy as roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
like a leech stuck in a vacuum, yall ain't nothing but a whole lot of suckin', goin' on in rap
yeah but i'm home
bad to the bone,
back in the zone,
let him alone
you don't wanna go eggin' him on
it'll never be my chair that you're on
crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen
other words there's no heir to the throne
when i die so does hip hop
hitchcock, better shit bitch ass got, a zip locked in a bag
you fags ain't been able to fade me since kid rock had a high top
keep blogging while i'm mind boggling my zone like i'm in the twilight,
talking of my bone this is my mic dog i like hogging it
flow so wet i'mma take this beat tobogganing
i'm water logging it, i'm sogging it
pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
suplex it on cement like i'm on some straight outta compton shit
take this dick and chomp on it
i'm so bad i can bitch slap a back handed compliment
jackass eat a donkey dick
the game i just about conquered it, like donkey kong
i'm bonkers bitch, i'm the king of this honkey shit!
i reign supreme in this honkey shit!
no sense screaming, and arguing
makes no difference whether a benz or bentley or a beamer's the car you in!
you think you ball well i palm it
i throw up bombs when i vomit
boy i throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omelette
but you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic
i should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
bitch i'm as bat shit as ozzy it's obvious
you can tell i go right off the bat
no pun intended but come any closer i'll bite off your head
tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web
i'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
i catch a fly in that bitch you think you fly you just food
i give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude
guess i just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and baboozled
confused as usual and you can get ripped she can open a can too
but you better hope you can handle the heat
or stay the fuck outta hell's kitchen
i came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken
yeah it's shady slut the rest can suck on a big one
cos i'm as despicable, as daffy duck when i'm spitting,
sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
mind full of demons, i don't wanna hear them anymore
got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
so they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
smoking weed, can all make a change
so i'm told, but i haven't seen the change unfold,
i keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
communities in need of people that will lead
keep your eyes open, i can only say i'll try
until the day i die
niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile, was a problem child

bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style,

that ain't been found i'm the underground king and
i ain't been crowned when i rhyme, something special happen every time
i'm the greatest, something like
ali in his prime
i walk the block with the bundles i've been knocked on the humble
swing the ox when i rumble show your ass what my gun do
got a temper nigga, go ahead, lose your head
turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
i walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
till i bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over
if it wasn't for rain joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
niggas don't know my style

i could be wrong but i never got along with cops
let's pretend marshall mathers never picked up a pen
let's pretend things would have been no different
pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin they could blow away with the wind
marshall, you're never gonna make it makes no sense to play the game there ain't no way that you'll win
pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
and it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changing again
he wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
he had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
fuck a talent show in a gymnasium, bitch, you won't amount to shit quit daydreaming kid
you need to get your cranium checked you thinking like an alien and just ain't realistic
now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed it
and his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap olympics
slept through his plane and he missed it
he's gon' have a hard time explaining to hailie and lainie these food stamps and this wic shit
cause he never risked shit he hoped and he wished it but it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here
they ask me am i okay, they ask me if i'm happy
are they asking me that be
cause of the shit that's been thrown at me?
or am i just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there
and i continuously stare at pictures of you
i never got to say i love you as much as i wanted to, but i do
yeah, i say it now when you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now?
but somehow i know you're near me in presence
oh, i went and dropped some presents off for easter
to them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
minds a little, and dog, you'll never believe this
but sharonda actually talks to me now jesus!
and everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
man, how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us?
they say grievance has a way of affectin' everyone different
if it's true, how the fuck am i supposed to get over you?
difficult as it sounds
doody, i dropped a tear in a rhyme
the day you find it is the day i stop missin' deshaun
holton, it was written, it was woven
for a soldier to leave so suddenly got me wide open
how could god take a soul so dope and
turn around and leave us all heartbroken?
know that you're sayin', keep goin'!
be a man! no emotion!
it's your duty, until we meet again, doody
doody that's what we'd call each other
i don't know where it came from
but it just stuck with us we was always brothers
never thought about each other's skin colors
'til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
it was like 90 degrees, i was catchin' a sunburn
tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
i'm moanin', i just wanna get home and
i look over, and your shirt is off
i'm like, you're gonna fry, you're like, no, i won't
i'm black, stupid! and black people, they got melatonin
in their skin we don't burn, meanwhile my face is glowin'
and i feel like i'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughin' at me
and snappin' at me with your shirt, bastard
and i still have to get you back for that shit
and by the way, them playboy rings my mother stole from you
well, nate finally got 'em back, shit
it must've been at least sixteen years ago
well, i put 'em in your cask oww
movin' past it, it still ain't registered yet
but you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
the motor city, motown, hip hop vet
hip hop shop, dreads, it don't stop there
yeah, as difficult as it sounds
doody, i dropped a tear in a rhyme
the day you find it is the day i stop missin' deshaun
holton, it was written, it was woven
for a soldier to leave so suddenly got me wide open
how could god take a soul so dope and
turn around and leave us all heartbroken?
know that you're sayin', keep goin'!
be a man! no emotion!
it's your duty, until we meet again, doody
and this might sound a little strange, but i'ma tell it
i found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and i picked it up to smell it
i wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass
and hang up in the hallway so i can always look at it
and as for all me and d12 we feel like fuck rap!
it feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
we shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
our twoways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and i know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is they're all still here, and you ain't
purple gang, you gotta keep pressin' on
don't ever give up the dream, dog, i got love for you all
and doody, it's true you brought people together
who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker, doody
i know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
but you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
if it had to happen, it had to happen
believe me, i know you're the one who taught me to throw them bows back on dresden
from eggin' cars to paintballin' and gettin' arrested
to sittin' across from each other in cells, laughin' and jestin'
they tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
i guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
me, you and what's his face? i forgot his fuckin' name
shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
and if i see him again i'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
and that's on hailie jade, whitney laine and alaina's name
i'll let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
in the air for you, and pour some liquor out
with obie in the parking lot of 54 just before
we were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
difficult as it sounds
(with royce da 5'9)<span>
oh, all around the world,
there's an echo
as he takes a bow
and they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
i can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling
i eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em
the only fucking thing that you consume is time
i'm super human, my world is like a rubik's cube
it's too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming
my mentality's caveman stupid woman
my life is truman show, all i have is music hoe
i stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
cause you better put a fork in it if you think i'm a lay here just spooning yo
oh you think you the shit 'cause i just said you was beautiful
diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
rotten to the core, to the bunghole all the way down to my soul, from my head to my toe...
ever since i was thirteen i learned how to sew, so shut my own booty hole
cause i ain't took no shit since i looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
i told these stupid hoes when i come back i'm a set this bitch on fire
and this time i don't mean i'm a pour gasoline on some chick and light her
cause this time when i fuck this world i'm put my whole goddamn dick inside her
i ain't even put my tip in that hoe yet
i'm go get nickel and try to rip it wider
oh, all around the world,
there's an echo
as he takes a bow
and they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
classical poems
battle my own demons
i need a glass of patron
bad as i need a horn
stabbing my clavicle bone
i'm matador prone
first time i seen a desert eagle
i was letting the 44 buss
the 44 pop
first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs
looking at robocop
i'm not a man, i'm a logo, i'm sustain
in order to clean my veins you need saline
i'm never referring to the solution
i'm talking about more like the mustang vroom
get respect from the getgo, hello
set to the echo, psycho
pen got a mind of it's own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
i'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
as the echo follows the maserati
as the petrol swallows,
i'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant
i'm fly like i'm, killing the scene like i'm a villain with wings
i'll sleep when i'm 6 feet deep,
right now i'm living a dream
though we may be reckless
the ladies check us
they whisper shady records
baby echo
oh, all around the world,
there's an echo
as he takes a bow
and they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
cause baby i'm lonely
can somebody hold me
it feel like i'm fallin now, i can't hold my ground
it feels like i'm only
trying but slowly
it feels like i'm fallin now, i can't hold my ground
no more
probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
in time it's all better, cause time heal whatever
i'mma need a moment cause moments last forever
cars with cream leather, females are on regular
what's the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
i'd rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
now ready, sean don got me feeling heavy
she like one more chance, more problems, no biggie, ah
it's all good, don't take it the wrong way
ain't nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
we can leave together or you can take your space
the night young, we should head over to my place
ha, now we laughing and all that
tell your friend they can fall back
ain't even gotta ask twice
she said what you feeling like?
i'm like...
jimmy can crack corn but i don't care
my enemies crack corn but i don't care
you can be black white or albino yeah
you can have cornrows inside your hair
i give a fuck if i don't like your stare
this bottle of wine goes upside your head
a little bit psycho but i know that
think you just don't say it and i won't say it
see if you don't brag then i don't brag
i know i'm bad as long as i know i'm bad
i don't need ya'll to cosign no shit
you can just keep making them tired old threats
little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
see me but don't dare to try no shit
cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
the rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
and i can be so quite and strike so fast
like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast
uh, first verse, uh
i'm armedon 'til i'm on a island
my life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
before i touch dirt i kill y'all with kindness
i kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
you've been warned if you've been born or if you conform
slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
and hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
me and shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow
i might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
though i ain't wrapped tight
my blood type's the '80s!
my '90s was like the navy, you was like the bradys
you still fly kites daily!
catch me in my mercedes
bumpin' ice, ice baby screaming, shady 'til i die!
like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
so i live it to the fullest 'til i'm swayze
and you only live it once, so i'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
wait, no, stop me now 'fore i get on a roll (danish)
let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
and i hope that i don't sound too heinous when i say this
nicki minaj, but i wanna stick my penis in your anus!
you morons think that i'm a genius

crazy, i am back, and i am razorsharp, baby
and that's back with a capital b with an exclamation mark,
maybe you should listen when i flip the linguistics
'cause i'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit
you don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'cause after i spit the bullets, i'mma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
i'mma kick the ballistics! so get this dick, i'mma live this
livin' life in the fast lane
movin' at the speed of life and i can't slow down
only got a gallon in the gas tank
but i'm almost at the finish line, so i can't stop now
i don't really know where i'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
gon' roll 'til i drop and ride 'til i die
i'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
at war with a bottle, as captain morgan attacks my organs
my slow flow is euphoric, it's like i rap endorphins
i made a pact with the devil that says i'll let you take me
you let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse of jack kevorkian
go back and forth in more beef than you can pack a fork in
i'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
my tenement, chimney now the semis the remedy, pow
spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity
now, was called m&ampm, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
chewed him up and spitted him out
girl, giddyup, now get, get down
he's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shitfit now
here, little tttrailer trash, take a look who's back in tttown
did i sststutter, motherfucker? fuck them all,
he shuts the whole motherfuckin' walmart dddown every time he comes arrround
and he came to the club tonight with 5'9 to hold this bitch down
like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, she tryna ddrdrown
shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick suckin' lips, i'm agitated, aggravated
to the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then i'm have to take it
and then after takin' that, i'mma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
it's gon' say the whole rap game passed away on top of the affidavit
graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
to michael jackson's activator (woo!)
meanin' i'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up data
rolling over hiphop in a verbal tractortrailer
homie, they're sick, you can normally ask a hater

percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later

livin' life in the fast lane
movin' at the speed of life and i can't slow down
only got a gallon in the gas tank
but i'm almost at the finish line, so i can't stop now
i don't really know where i'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride

there's mayonnaise on this, i need a plain sandwich
hurry up, give me one, rappers try to step to this static they wanna give me none
(fresh vegetables)
with fresh vegetables, my testicles are hanging off to the left of you
you're bisexual, and there's a guy next to you, standing, rappers know that i

preparation h, you didn't even let me finish my rhyme
just shut up for one more time, while i just shine, on this
microphone, cause i'mma be honest, any mc who tries to step to this
i'm making you a promise, that what? give me a word
(nostradamus)
that nostradamus is blowing up your house, killing your foster mammas
and coming back to get your parents, well i have it
these rhymes are fourteen karat, solid gold
rappers step to me, you get your wallet stole
(times square)
in times square, i got blonde hair, i'm higher than con air
rappers don't want to see me, i'll butt fuck goldie hawn bare
in a lawn chair, cause i'm there
(kurt russell)
with kurt russell, saying come here goldie, you want my love muscle?
i know you want it, i get blunted, then i

dad, i hope you're fucking dying, off this porno mag
yo, did you see my ad? yo, wait a minute, did you see my ass?
is what i meant to say, i meant to say a rhyme that goes this way is elementary
for the century, slim shady's is gonna be the illest
(flamingos)
what? flamingos? my mother goes out and plays bingo
every single day, at the bingo hall, that's why my dick is single, small
didn't blow up, just don't give a what? a cuff?
didn't blow up, just don't give a what? a cuff?
(dt's fired)
but dt's fired, he's retired, he's not hired, yo plus i'm tired
of busting and spitting this rhyme nonstop, i'm on top
taking records to the pawnshop, stretch
damn, see my big ick? catch
put a d in front of it, rappers don't want none of it
coming with a ton of shit to spill, slim shady out, i get ill with the skill
baby, aight baby, slim shady
kick eighty million rhymes, till i'm older than grady
spilled gravy, all over my damn navy blue avi
yo man.. yo marsh man, you've been kickin' all this shit about yourself, what about the homies man?
ai, you want one about the posse, aight 
oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
oh, oh, ph, ohh
foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
well foolish pride has alot of things to say
you got foolish pride, you got tooth decay
but tooth decay is another problem
so let's take this old foolish pride and solve it
now, when i talk about foolish pride
i mean blacks &amp whites taking different sides
when blacks and whites take different sides
unity never happens, and we will subside
we will subside and hatred will release
and everything will just crush that peace
well, when we crush that peace, we start hatin' each other
but remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
just like i'm a mister
i seen a black girlfriend and i kissed her
i kissed her i placed it on her cheek
and she didn't come back til next week
now it was next week and she was back again
wanting to kiss a white kid
so she was my girlfriend, we started going out
but that's okay because we were black and white
blacks and whites they sometimes mix
but black girls only want your money cause they're dumb chicks
so i'ma say like this
don't date a black girl, take it as a diss
if you want, but if you don't
i'ma tell you like this, i surely won't
never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
and that shit ain't funny
so i'ma say look honey
why do you do this?
you know, you step up to me like you a brutus
then you try to grab my spinach
because its green and that's cash
so get outta here, 'cause i don't need your ass
i said that before, but that's okay because like i said you're a whore
black girls and white girls just don't mix
because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
white girls are good i like white girls
i like white girls all over the world
white girls are fine and they blow my mind
and that's why i'm here now telling you this rhyme
'cause black girls, i really don't like
we don't mix, it's like riding a bike
when you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
you know it's kinda hard and that's why i say to you
i'm giving you a little advice
don't date a black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice
you won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
and that ain't funny
so i'ma say look honey
i thought i said that before
but like i said again you're nothing but a big whore
so when mike catch on the bass line
that's okay 'cause we will not just waste time
i'll get straight to the point
black girls are bitches, that's why i'ma tell ya you better pull up your britches
'cause all that cash is making your ass drag
from the boyfriend ya ganked and that's pretty bad
i mean that's pretty sad when ya dating a black guy
and then you turn around and fuck another big, black guy
now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
but that's okay because you need a goddamn spanking
from me, the funky eminem
i'm busting rhymes and i'm swallowing phlegm
i'm busting a freestyle just like this
i say swallowing phlegm and howard gets pissed
but when howard gets pissed that's okay
because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
so i'll just worry about that problem when i come to it
i cross that bridge when i come to it
because, i forgot the chorus
but that's okay 'cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us
so i'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl
she turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
a wack girl, because black girls ain't funny
all they want is your godamn money
they take you for everything you got
and then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand
so i'ma kick it to you just like this
how does the chorus go, i forgot
but that's okay, 'cause i'ma tell you in stride
i'ma say oh foolish pride
oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
i done figured this rap shit out
i map shit out strategically
timing is everything and that seems to be the key
to my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
and order the mask til they want a war, don't start a war
shit not no more, we done scared em off, there are no more
victims to stick i'm fixin to pick some and start shit
i'm outta <i>[repeat]<i>
pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
ain't got no more targets, shit irv and jeff
we done beat em to death, benzino went deaf
there seems to just be no one left to bully
bush is pussy
why the fuck you think his name's bush?
puss is bushy
ain't shit goin on, shit i been gettin so bored lately
i'm thinkin of doin some shit to get you to go and hate me again
to tell the truth, i liked the shit better then
shit i could spit better, i'm bout to kick this sick shit again, look
the game just isn't the same, it's changin
shit dre's quittin, jay'z quittin, now it's just gangstas just sayin the same shit
it's ancient, it's fakin
it's makin me so bored, i'mma just make a new language
fubba you cubba kubba, yubba obubba uba
yubba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
summaladoomalama
i'm not a human i'm a supersonic neurobonic suicidal unibomber
you think i'm a nuisce, i'm impressive i'm the new madonna
jeffery dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
a lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest, to be honest
(feat. proof)<span>
fuck it, friends or no friends i had enough bullshit to last me clear to the end
i shoulda been able to see that you were the one behind this
but i was blind as fuck to think that you weren't the kind that stuck some more in the spine this
it was as if our friendship broke in half
and watch you turn everything into a game and joke and laugh
and both of us know we can't discuss the situation
like adults each confrontation just results in accusations and insults
so i'ma just let it go for now
and leave you be, it's over now
what goes around comes back around
believe you me, lay low for now, come here you fuckin'
come here you fuckin' backstabber
why i oughta, beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you fuckin' backstabber
why i oughta, beat a nigga that's up to no good, haha
why don't you take a second to stop and think about what you done
and you want to call that being a friend, that isn't what you want
all because of what you run your mouth, you wanna prance around and gloat?
let's see how well you dance around when i got my hands around your throat
cause it's a matter of time till i get my blows in and it won't be long
you shouldn't go walkin' around and stickin' your nose in where it don't belong
cause every time you talked when you was stretchin the truth
theres gonna be one more flyin' knuckle you're gonna catch in the tooth
come here, come here you fuckin'
come here you lil doublecrossing goin behind my back snitcher
good for nothin but trouble causin instigating fact switcher
you were the least that i suspected
till the puzzle fell into place with every piece that i selected
but i'll never let that crap happen again
you come back blabbin' again
catch it smack dab in the chin
that's for backstabbin a friend
cause every name in the book
wouldn't be enough
so i just figured i'd say your name in the hook
check it out, come here you fuckin
backstabbers don't live too long
around my way friendships betrayed
in the hood you die for that!
for those that don't love this combat and verbally say this
this could relate to the death of a backstabber
thats like the desire to make total discombobulation and combustion of the neck
the backstabber for the female, you skeezin' ass bitch nigga!
so remember, the backstabber always loses in the end
a friend is a friend to the end
fri for fri, end a friend for the end..yes
to eternity..the backstabber shall never flourish
(from cradle 2 the grave soundtrack)<span>
i ain't gonna eat, i ain't gonna sleep
ain't gonna breathe, 'til i see what i wanna see
and what i wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
permanently, you just being hurt
this ain't gonna work for me
it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
cause we, are just gonna be, enemies
as long as we breathe, i don't ever see, either of us
coming to terms, where we can agree
there ain't gonna be, no reasoning, speaking wit me
you speak on my seed, then me, no speaka ingles
so we gonna beef, and keep on beefing, unless
you're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
and settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
a demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
and you're gonna see, this gangster pee on himself
i see you d12, and thanks, but me need no help
me do this one all by my lonely
i don't need fifteen of my homies
when i see you, i'm seeing you, me and you only
we never met, but best believe you gon' know me
when i'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
come on bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
you was gonna do, that's what i thought, you're pitiful
i'm rid of you, all of you, ja, you'll get it too!
now go to sleep bitch
die, motherfucker, die
ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
go to sleep, bitch (what)
why are you still alive
how many times i gotta say, close ya eyes
and go to sleep bitch (what)
die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye
go to sleep bitch (what)
why are you still alive
why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
go to sleep bitch
we got you niggas nervous
on purpose, to hurt your focus
you's not mc's, you's worthless
you's not them g's, you's a circus
you's no appeal, please
you's curtains, you use words kool herc slurred in two thousand third
you's purping, you's no threat, who's ya serving
when lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
you fuck with a label overseeing the earth
shady muthafucka, o. trice's birth
and as i mold, i become a curse
so we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
depicts fiction in his verse
and as i breathe, and you be deceased
the world believe you deceived just to speak
you's not the streets, you's the desk
use not your chest nigga, use a vest
before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth
hey dog, i'mma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
i'mma stay blazing new york with the heat
stalk on the beat, walk with my feet
understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet
peep how i'm moving, peep where i'm going
shit don't seep, then sleep not knowing
but i'mma keep growing, getting larger than life
easy going with the same one that started the fight
he be knowing how dog get, when dog don't bite
tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
grand champ, and my blood line is tight
cuz it's all good, it's all right
niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
blood line, and, we can go track for track
damn, dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that
all you motherfuckers, take that
here, take this too, bitch
uh, uh, uh, uh, wahoo
we're killing all you motherfuckers dead, all of you
fake ass gangsters
no more press
no more press
rot, motherfuckers, rot
decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfucking dirt
die nameless, bitch, die nameless, no more fame
ahh, hahahaha
shut up and sing
listen gone again.....
have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
when they know they're your heart
and you know you were their armour
and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
but what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
and everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
what happens when you become the main source of her pain?
daddy look what i made, dad's gotta go catch a plane
daddy where's mommy? i can't find mommy where is she?
i don't know go play hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
i'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
and put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
that's slim shady, yeah baby, slim shady's crazy
shady made me, but tonight shady's rockabybaby...
listen gone again
story of my life
searching for the right
but it keeps avoiding me
listen gone again
sorrow in my soul
cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company
they say they never really miss you til you dead or you gone
so on that note i'm leaving after the song
so you ain't gotta feel no way about jay so long
atleast let me tell you why i'm this way, hold on
i was conceived by gloria carter and adaness revees
who made love under the siccamore tree 
which makes me
a more sicker m.c. and my momma would claim
at 10 pounds when i was born i didn't give her no pain
although through the years i gave her her fair share
i gave her her first real scare
if you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
ready to scrap asap
take your fists and just ball it
show who's big and who's smallest you're christopher wallace
now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
and set it on 'em like a placemat
(i am phenomenal)
and i want you to say that
i am phenomenal
with every ounce of my blood
with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm phenomenal
i am phenomenal
however long that it takes
i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
i am phenomenal
but i would never say, oh, it's impossible'
cause i'm born to be phenomenal
step into the unknown and find yourself
you're floating freely, no emotion
got a fuckin' mouth with no shutoff valve
can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
cause i worked my butt off now
it's a subject that i don't know how to shut up about
cause i stuck it out
like a motherfucking tongue thats how, i responded when i got shoved around
you're gonna have nonbelievers
but when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
get it how you live
but are you prepared to give more than you get?
and put in twice what you get back from this shit
though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
rap is my shiv
but it's like my shield at the same time i wield and my knife is will
sometimes i feel just like b. real from cypress hill
how i can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
i rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
ready to face any challenge, waitin'
can taste it, it's salivation, i'm wagin' retaliation
look what i have built, reputation is validation
the only thing i'm capable of makin' is amazing
only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
or accusation... i am legendary status, in fact
that is the only way you'll ever be able to say
your legend is makin' an allegation
i write with the left, same hand i hold the mic with
as i fight to the death, 'til my last breath
managed to prove who the best man is
prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standing
in the end, but i ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
cause i am
i am phenomenal
with every ounce of my blood
with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm phenomenal
i am phenomenal
however long that it takes
i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
i am phenomenal
but i would never say, soh, it's impossible'
yo.. i dedicate to this.. to yo..

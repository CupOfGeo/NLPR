<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I am going up<br/>
I am going all the way through the fire<br/>
I get up and go higher <br/>
So please donât bring me down<br/>
And nothing is gonna bring me down<br/>
I am going all the way thru the fire<br/>
I will get up and then go higher<br/>
So please donât knock me down<br/>
And nothing is gonna knock me down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Now I ainât got no kids yet,<br/>
But this one here is for practice<br/>
I hate to get the seats in Benz wet.<br/>
But thatâs how good your ass is.<br/>
Make an old man get his glasses.<br/>
Make Wesley pay his taxes<br/>
Then follow ur moves all weak on Twitter<br/>
Probably make a gay nigga consider.<br/>
You rocking now with the best Mayne. (man)<br/>
Dress game down to the sex game<br/>
Wonât brag but the boy has been blessed with the blessed mayne<br/>
Let you play with the stick ovechkayne.<br/>
Sheâs calling, sheâs texting<br/>
Sheâs falling but let me explain<br/>
Gotta tell your old boyfriend <br/>
Skate girl<br/>
Cauz a nigga donât play them ex games.<br/>
No! Straight sexing<br/>
No handcuffs or arresting<br/>
And I ainât coming off my last name.<br/>
Cauz I really canât take no stressing<br/>
Bout where I done been<br/>
Who I done hit<br/>
Your home girl saying <br/>
Heâs a bad boy<br/>
Bout where I done been<br/>
Who I done hit<br/>
Your home girl saying <br/>
Heâs a bad boy<br/>
<br/>
She said<br/>
I heard you got a main chick<br/>
A mistress and some hoes<br/>
You be up to no good<br/>
And every body knows<br/>
<br/>
I canât get enough of what you got<br/>
Good god<br/>
You hit the spot<br/>
Tried to let go but I just could not<br/>
So donât you stop I need that<br/>
<br/>
Hey globetrotter,<br/>
Cole hotter<br/>
Either way<br/>
Out in London town<br/>
Hoes holla Cauz they love my sound<br/>
And I got love for the underground.<br/>
Kweli pimp C hot town<br/>
Where bun gets down<br/>
Met a bad bitch <br/>
Thatâll cut all night<br/>
Thatâll suck all night<br/>
You just, cut off lights<br/>
Never fuss or fight <br/>
Almost missed my flight<br/>
Tryna give my last girl a nut<br/>
All Right?<br/>
She be down for whatever <br/>
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts<br/>
All Right?<br/>
<br/>
On the grynd tryna find<br/>
This lettuce<br/>
I love it when you give me head<br/>
I hate it when you give me headaches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I am going up<br/>
I am going all the way through the fire<br/>
I get up and go higher <br/>
So please donât bring me down<br/>
And nothing is gonna bring me down<br/>
I am going all the way thru the fire<br/>
I will get up and still get higher<br/>
So please donât knock me down<br/>
And nothing is gonna knock me down <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Nobody asked for life to deal us<br/>
With these bullshit hands we are dealt<br/>
We have to take these cards ourselves<br/>
And flip them. Donât expect no help<br/>
Now I could have <br/>
Either just<br/>
Sat on my ass<br/>
And pissed and moaned<br/>
Or take this situation in which I am placed in<br/>
And get up and get my own<br/>
I was never the type of kid<br/>
To wait by the door and pack his bags<br/>
Who sat on the posch hoped and prayed <br/>
For a dad to show who never did<br/>
I just wanted to fit in<br/>
At every single place<br/>
Every school I went<br/>
I dreamed of being that cool kid<br/>
Even if it means acting stupid<br/>
Aunt Edna always told me<br/>
Keep making<br/>
That face itâll get stuck like that<br/>
Meanwhile I am just standing<br/>
There holding<br/>
My tongue tryna talk like this<br/>
Till I stuck my tongue <br/>
On that<br/>
Frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old<br/>
I learned my lesson then<br/>
Cauz I wasnât tryna impress my friends no more<br/>
But I already told you my whole life story<br/>
Not just based on my description<br/>
Cauz where you see it from where you are sitting<br/>
Its probably 110% different<br/>
I guess we would have to walk a mile<br/>
In each others shoes<br/>
At least <br/>
What size you wear??<br/>
I wear tens<br/>
Letâs see if you can fit your feet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I am going up<br/>
I am going all the way through the fire<br/>
I get up and go higher <br/>
So please donât bring me down<br/>
And nothing is gonna bring me down<br/>
I am going all the way thru the fire<br/>
I will get up and then go higher<br/>
So please donât knock me down<br/>
And nothing is gonna knock me down

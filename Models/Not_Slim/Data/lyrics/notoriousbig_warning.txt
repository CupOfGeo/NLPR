"They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus<br/>
with the Texas license plate outta state<br/>

and they heard you got half of Virginia locked down<br/>
they even heard about the crib<br/>
you bought your moms south Florida<br/>
the fifth corridor."<br/>
<br/>
Call the coroner<br/>

and flower bringing<br/>
if my burglar alarm starts ringing<br/>
<br/>

all-purpose war<br/>
got the rottweilers by the door<br/>
and I feed 'em gun powder<br/>
so they can devour<br/>
the criminals<br/>
tryna drop my decimals<br/>

grab they guns and come and get you<br/>
Bet you Biggie won't slip<br/>
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip<br/>
so I can rip through the ligaments<br/>
put the fuckers in a bad predicament<br/>
where all the foul niggas went<br/>
Touch my cheddar<br/>

Buck what I'mma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck<br/>
I bring pain<br/>
blood stains<br/>

Of his jacket<br/>

Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket<br/>
so I can reload and explode on you rasshole<br/>
I fuck around and get hardcore<br/>
C4 to your door<br/>

The more weed smoke I puff<br/>

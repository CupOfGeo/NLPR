Oh, my goodness<br/>
What have I done<br/>
Oh no<br/>
I can't believe it<br/>
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm<br/>
And I'm ready to drop bombs<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca Rebecca<br/>
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca<br/>
That's my sector<br/>
Homosexual dissector<br/>
Come again rewind selector<br/>
<br/>
I said nice rectum<br/>
I had a vasectomy Hector<br/>
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya<br/>
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya<br/>
I tantalize ya in less than five seconds I get ya<br/>
<br/>
They say once bitten and twice shy<br/>
Well lie next to the guy<br/>
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities<br/>
Why yes sir<br/>
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser<br/>
<br/>
That's my kinda vibe what else should I try Lester<br/>
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester<br/>
Perform the home abortion with Dexter<br/>
Then I guess I'll dig her fetus out<br/>
With a wire hanger then digest her<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's time for you to hate me again<br/>
Let's begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How should I begin it and where does it all end<br/>
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in<br/>
<br/>
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again<br/>
Let's begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How should I begin it and where does it all end<br/>
My medicine ball you're in my medicine ball friends<br/>
<br/>
All my West Side bitches throw it up<br/>
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up<br/>
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end, sure enough<br/>
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up<br/>
<br/>
Man you seen it all before you're all too familiar with it<br/>
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it<br/>
You know you with it girl don't front, oh no you didn't I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole you kidding?<br/>
<br/>
I'll pee on Rihanna<br/>
See man I do what I wanna<br/>
Spray perfume in the sauna room<br/>
Crazy-gluing Madonna<br/>
To the La-Z-Boy sofa<br/>
Fold her in two then sit on her<br/>
Imagine a visual for that man<br/>
<br/>
Who would've thought I could ever be such a relentless prick<br/>
Unleashing his vengeance<br/>
But the chick's so old<br/>
She looks like she outlived a life sentence<br/>
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive<br/>
If you weren't so defensive<br/>
It wouldn't be<br/>
You're so sensitive<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's time for you to hate me again<br/>
Let's begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How should I begin it and where does it all end<br/>
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in<br/>
<br/>
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again<br/>
Let's begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How should I begin it and where does it all end<br/>
My medicine ball you're in my medicine ball friends<br/>
<br/>
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand<br/>
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand<br/>
Here you need a hand, big man, grab hold of this branch<br/>
With both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault<br/>
His name rhymes with so many different words<br/>
Jeeze<br/>
So one last time, Mister Christopher Reeves<br/>
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse please<br/>
<br/>
Eminem I'm coming to kill you<br/>
Always hated you and I still do<br/>
You'll never fill my shoes<br/>
My Superman costume<br/>
Doesn't even fit you they don't feel you<br/>
<br/>
You're taking this shit too far<br/>
Who d'you think you are?<br/>
Hang my suit up in the armoire<br/>
Every day I hate you more and more<br/>
Throw down the cardboard<br/>
Let's break-dance if you think you're hardcore<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's time for you to hate me again<br/>
Let's begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How should I begin it and where does it all end<br/>
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in<br/>
<br/>
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again<br/>
Let's begin now hand me the pen<br/>
How should I begin it and where does it all end<br/>
My medicine ball you're in my medicine ball friends<br/>
<br/>
The world is mine!

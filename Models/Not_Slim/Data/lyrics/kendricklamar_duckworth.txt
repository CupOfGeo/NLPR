<i>[BÄkon and Kid Capri:]</i><br/>
It was always me vs the world<br/>
Until I found it's me vs me<br/>
Why, why, why, why?<br/>
Why, why, why, why?<br/>
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth<br/>
We gon' put it in reverse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ted Taylor:]</i><br/>
Darling, I told you many times<br/>
And I am telling you once again<br/>
Just to remind you, sweetheart<br/>
That my...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard<br/>
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark<br/>
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star<br/>
Life is one funny mothafucka<br/>
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him<br/>
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep<br/>
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep<br/>
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects<br/>
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect<br/>
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot<br/>
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals<br/>
Anthony was the oldest of seven<br/>
Well-respected, calm and collected<br/>
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, Momma on crack<br/>
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her<br/>
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'<br/>
He was meant to be dangerous<br/>
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'<br/>
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces<br/>
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend<br/>
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie<br/>
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him<br/>
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily<br/>
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies<br/>
Had a couple of shooters<br/>
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'<br/>
But witnesses couldn't prove it<br/>
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin<br/>
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'<br/>
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang<br/>
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang<br/>
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came<br/>
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots<br/>
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks<br/>
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it<br/>
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken<br/>
See, at this chicken spot<br/>
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot<br/>
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth<br/>
He worked the window, his name was Ducky<br/>
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes<br/>
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome<br/>
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars<br/>
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college<br/>
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it<br/>
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends<br/>
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket<br/>
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it<br/>
Stuck up the place before, back in '84<br/>
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war<br/>
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works<br/>
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious<br/>
Prevalent proposition with 9's<br/>
Ducky was well-aware<br/>
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year<br/>
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides<br/>
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line<br/>
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide<br/>
They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive<br/>
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives<br/>
One curse at a time<br/>
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why<br/>
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments<br/>
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it<br/>
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again<br/>
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits<br/>
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident<br/>
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?<br/>
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life<br/>
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight<br/>
<br/>

So, I was takin' a walk the other dayâ¦

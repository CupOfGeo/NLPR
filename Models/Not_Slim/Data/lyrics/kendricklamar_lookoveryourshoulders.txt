Just look over your shoulders, honey!<br/>
Yeah, I know<br/>
It's been a minute<br/>
Got to know<br/>
Just look over your shoulders, honey!<br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
Just look over your shoulders!<br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
Just look over your shoulders, honey!<br/>
Yeah, you need me (woooh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy<br/>
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me<br/>
Big marbles, nigga<br/>
I lead this new generation, boy<br/>
Don't argue with us<br/>
Marvelous beat selectors, authors and novel spitters<br/>
And it's all for the literature<br/>
And it's all for the hideous<br/>
The nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh<br/>
I ain't afraid to say I need you, ah yeah (Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)<br/>
I promise I'd never leave you, ah yeah<br/>
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes<br/>
I write for sure, my folks unite<br/>
Soon as the flow get nice<br/>
The poltergeist that scare emcees<br/>
My prototype for every<br/>
My share of D's and R.I.P<br/>
She know my type of style is like my everything<br/>
Apparently, my appetite stay famished<br/>
Bite no hand that feed<br/>
The culture vulture die and bleed<br/>
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams<br/>
Control this pen (Look over your shoulder)<br/>
Boldest lines in rhymes and things<br/>
Devote my time and mind it seems<br/>
Supposed to shine, remind I'm king<br/>
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends<br/>
The pro's the con's, the diamond rings<br/>
The forward time, but I'ma bring<br/>
The soul divine and cross between<br/>
What's your's and mine's, the gold, the green<br/>
The roads that show just what it mean<br/>
That grabbed Shakur and by the wing<br/>
And fly before my vocal scream!<br/>
For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc bag full of goodies<br/>
You Chris Rock<br/>
Hit the pookie and pit stops<br/>
Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug<br/>
Just look over your shoulders<br/>
When they fuck you over<br/>
It's love, I know ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Jackson:]</i><br/>
(Wooh!)<br/>
Don't you know, baby?<br/>
Don't you know, baby?<br/>
Just look over your shoulders, honey!<br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
Just look over your shoulders!<br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
Just look over your shoulders, honey!<br/>
Yeah yeah, you need me (woooh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta Rhymes:]</i><br/>
Shhh, look over your shoulder, get me?<br/>
'Cause I done bodied the game to the point<br/>
Niggas scared to rap with me<br/>
Get burned until they anointed me<br/>
One of the kings of black history<br/>
And yes, I see the game is a little different<br/>
Niggas lack simply<br/>
And bars and I spit 'em like darts<br/>
'Til they puncture your kidney<br/>
You trash and it don't matter how much you gon' try to convince me<br/>
And you gon' make my gun cock until your hole night away<br/>
Yeah, ohh<br/>
I'm the Buddha, the Ali Baba, the believerer maker<br/>
So pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake 'em<br/>
So rude, I'm so ice cold but I'm what you need to just wake 'em<br/>
While 'em crowns and medals on the wall waitin' for me to just take 'em<br/>
When I arrive, my theme music, gotta pound to it<br/>
And when I leave, even my shadow got a sound to it<br/>
'Cause I'm the god, the harder, the martyr, the father<br/>
I spit the saliva, that's leaking the lava<br/>
Completin' the saga while meetin' and greetin'<br/>
And beating you niggas completed-ly<br/>
Conquer, extremely bark on a nigga<br/>
You see me, you deeply carve up a nigga, believe me<br/>
Graffiti your arm up, you heebee, you jeebee<br/>
But, Kenny, you brought up (You give me pity)<br/>
Now give me the startup<br/>
You treat me, you greet me, you meet me with arms up<br/>
So sweet when I spit<br/>
Heaven's deep, it was deep<br/>
I was sleep, now the guard's up, hmm<br/>
Upholding the fundamentals<br/>
While most of you boast the rental<br/>
Focus on what's most essential<br/>
Spit bars to provoke your mental<br/>
Do I have your attendamiento?<br/>
While I clap these raps like thunders<br/>
Look over your shoulder boy and wonder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Jackson &amp; SZA:]</i><br/>
(Wooh!)<br/>
Don't you know, baby? (ooh, woah)<br/>
Don't you know, baby? (mhm, mhn, yeah)<br/>
Just look over your shoulders, honey!<br/>
Whenever you need me (when you need me)<br/>
Just look over your shoulders!<br/>
Whenever you need me (whenever you need me)<br/>
Just look over your shoulders, honey!<br/>
Yeah yeah, you need me (woooh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SZA:]</i><br/>
With god watchin' over us<br/>
And me over your shoulders<br/>
(All you had to do is look forward)<br/>
But what you gonna do?<br/>
You pull the devil even closer<br/>
(Why'd you pull the devil even closer?)<br/>
Them clowns that you hang with<br/>
More ridiculous than white Cleopatra<br/>
Or Caucasians telling blacks to go back to Africa<br/>
But I digress, you're more, but you act less<br/>
Why do you act less?<br/>
Even still, when the weight of life feels like a boulder<br/>
(Just look over your shoulders)<br/>
I'm here whenever you need me<br/>
When you need me<br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
When you need me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Jackson, SZA:]</i><br/>
(Wooh!)<br/>
Don't you know, baby?<br/>
Don't you know, baby?<br/>
Just look over your shoulders, honey!<br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
Just look over your shoulders!<br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
Just look over shoulders, honey!<br/>
Yeah yeah, you need me (Wooh!)<br/>
(Wooh!)<br/>
Don't you know baby?<br/>
Don't you know baby?<br/>
Just look over your shoulders, honey!<br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
Just look over your shoulders!<br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
Just look over your shoulders, honey!

<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
One shot two shot three shots four shots<br/>
All I hear is gunshots<br/>
This is where the fun stops<br/>
Bodies drop, hit the floor<br/>
Music's off, party stops<br/>
Everybody hit the door<br/>
Somebody's licking shots off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bizarre:]</i><br/>
Security's gone I'm trapped in the club<br/>
And I'm tryna run and get my motherfucking gun<br/>
(Nigga what about your wife)<br/>
Nigga fuck my wife I'm tryna run and save my motherfucking life<br/>
Oh shit, the shooter's comin'<br/>
Bitches hollering, niggas running<br/>
People shot all over the floor<br/>
And I'm tryna make it to the St. Andrew's door<br/>
Hey man<br/>
That's the sound of the Glock<br/>
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot<br/>
I done messed around and forgot my TEC<br/>
I don't see nobody but Fatt Father and Hex<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kuniva:]</i><br/>
(Kuniva you alright)<br/>
These niggas is trippin'<br/>
(Where's Bizarre at?)<br/>
(I don't know, man)<br/>
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at<br/>
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wildin'<br/>
Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling<br/>
This chick is clinging on to me sobbing and sighing<br/>
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying<br/>
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled<br/>
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield<br/>
And she got hit now she's yelling<br/>
(Don't leave me!)<br/>
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me<br/>
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape<br/>
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late<br/>

I'm on 7 Mile what the fuck was that<br/>
Damn somebody hit me from the back<br/>
(With what? Their car?)<br/>
With a gat nigga and my tire flat<br/>
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes<br/>
(Is you hit?)<br/>
I don't know<br/>
But I can tell you what they drove<br/>
It was a black Mitsubishi with<br/>
(Shit that's the clique we beefing with.)<br/>
Man! (I swear!)<br/>
And I was on my way there<br/>
Believe me I'm leaving a carcass today<br/>
And I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way<br/>
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked<br/>

I've never seen no shit like this in my life before<br/>
People are still camped out from the night before<br/>
Sleeping outside the door waiting in line<br/>
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform<br/>
The fire marshals know the venue's too small<br/>
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans<br/>
And some cum-wad from out the parking lot<br/>
Gets in an argument over a parking spot<br/>
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of 'em off<br/>
Missed who he's aiming for six feet away's the door<br/>
Into St. Andrew's Hall<br/>
Now the strays flying all over the place<br/>
Grazed one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall<br/>
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off<br/>
I'm posted up at the bar having a Mazel Tov<br/>
Bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off<br/>
Thank God I'm alive I gotta find Denaun<br/>
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him<br/>
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre<br/>
Nah I guess not, what the fuck oh my God it was<br/>
I never saw him run so fast in my life<br/>
Look at him hauling ass I think he left his wife<br/>
There she is on the ground being trampled<br/>
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her<br/>
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit<br/>
My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin<br/>
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop Dee<br/>
Follow Bizarre's path ran through it<br/>
Made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps<br/>
Looked up and I seen Swift shooting it out<br/>
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with<br/>
But Denaun's right behind him squeezing his four-fifth<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Kon Artis:]</i><br/>
It's Friday night came to this bitch right<br/>
Big ass in my left hand, Desert Eagle in my right<br/>
I ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight<br/>
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight<br/>
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge<br/>
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in<br/>
Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that this schmuck<br/>
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker<br/>
So one shot for the money two's to stop the show<br/>
Third's for the bartender<br/>
(bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')<br/>
I just wanna know who's driving the black Mitsubishi<br/>
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece<br/>

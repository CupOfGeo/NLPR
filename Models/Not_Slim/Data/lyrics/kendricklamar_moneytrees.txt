<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish<br/>
Hit the house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish<br/>
Home invasion was persuasive<br/>
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish<br/>
<br/>
Dreams of living life like rappers do<br/>
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool<br/>
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros<br/>
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on<br/>
<br/>
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish<br/>
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish<br/>
The only thing we had to free our mind<br/>
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs<br/>
<br/>
You looking like a easy come-up, ya bish<br/>
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish<br/>
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew<br/>
Go at a reverend for the revenue<br/>
<br/>
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah<br/>
Pick your poison tell me what you do<br/>
Everybody gon' respect the shooter<br/>
But the one in front of the gun lives forever<br/>
(The one in front of the gun, forever)<br/>
<br/>
And I been hustlin' all day,<br/>
This a way, that a way<br/>
Through canals and alleyways, just to say<br/>
Money trees is the perfect place for shade<br/>
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah<br/>
<br/>
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch<br/>
That's just how I feel, nah<br/>
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with<br/>
That's just how I feel, nah, nah<br/>
A dollar might just make that lane switch<br/>
That's just how I feel, nah<br/>
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich<br/>
That's just how I feel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Dreams of living life like rappers do<br/>
Bump that new E-40 at the school<br/>
(we at the school)<br/>
You know, âBig Ballin' With My Homiesâ<br/>
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational<br/>
<br/>
Back to reality we poor, ya bish<br/>
Another casualty at war, ya bish<br/>
Two bullets in my uncle Tony head<br/>
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish<br/>
<br/>
That Louies Burger never be the same<br/>
(won't be the same)<br/>
A Louis belt will never ease that pain<br/>
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'<br/>
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirtin'<br/>
<br/>
Gang signs out the window, ya bish<br/>
Hoping all of 'em offend you, ya bish<br/>
They say your hood is a pot of gold<br/>
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home<br/>
<br/>
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah<br/>
Pick your poison tell me what you do<br/>
Everybody gon' respect the shooter<br/>
But the one in front of the gun lives forever<br/>
(The one in front of the gun, forever)<br/>
<br/>
And I been hustlin' all day,<br/>
This a way, that a way<br/>
Through canals and alleyways, just to say<br/>
Money trees is the perfect place for shade<br/>

A dollar might just fuck your main bitch<br/>
That's just how I feel, nah<br/>
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with<br/>
That's just how I feel, nah, nah<br/>
A dollar might just make that lane switch<br/>
That's just how I feel, nah<br/>
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel<br/>

<i>[Anna Wise 2x:]</i><br/>
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way<br/>
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way<br/>
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way<br/>
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Imagine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets<br/>
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings,<br/>
Liquor spilling pistols popping<br/>
Baking soda YOLA whipping,<br/>
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving<br/>
My homeboy just domed a nigga,<br/>
I just hope the Lord forgive him<br/>
<br/>
Pots with cocaine residue,<br/>
Every day I'm hustling<br/>
What else is a thug to do<br/>
When you eat cheese from the government<br/>
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em,<br/>
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch<br/>
Got that drum and I got them bands<br/>
Just like a parade, bitch<br/>
<br/>
Drop that work up in the bushes,<br/>
Hope them boys don't see my stash<br/>
If they do tell the truth,<br/>
This the last time you might see my ass<br/>
<br/>
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut,<br/>
Them serpents lurking blood<br/>
Bitches selling pussy, niggas<br/>
Selling drugs but it's all good<br/>
<br/>
Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is<br/>
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is<br/>
<br/>
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees<br/>
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree<br/>
<br/>
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah<br/>
Pick your poison tell me what you do<br/>
Everybody gon' respect the shooter<br/>
But the one in front of the gun lives forever<br/>
(The one in front of the gun, forever)<br/>
<br/>
And I been hustlin' all day,<br/>
This a way, that a way<br/>
Through canals and alleyways, just to say<br/>
Money trees is the perfect place for shade<br/>
And that's just how I feel<br/>

<i>[K's Mom:]</i> Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways.<br/>

<i>[K's Dad:]</i> Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass. Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass.<br/>

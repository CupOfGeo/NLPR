<i>[*plane crashing*]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yo I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me, 'cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness<br/>
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break it down<br/>
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout<br/>
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows<br/>
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)<br/>
Full magazine could take Staples out<br/>
Savage, but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account<br/>
But, bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown<br/>
<br/>
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch<br/>
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent?<br/>
Oh, critiquin' my talent?<br/>
Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are<br/>
To give a sub-par bar, even have an opinion or view<br/>
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news<br/>
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you<br/>
Billions of views, your ten cents are two<br/>
Skim through the music to give shit reviews<br/>
To get clicks, but, bitch, you just lit the fuse<br/>
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'<br/>
Shit-list renewed so get shit to do<br/>
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' t-to<br/>
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow<br/>
Everyone copies though? Probably no<br/>
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adios<br/>
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though<br/>
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me<br/>
All I am simply is just an MC<br/>
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea<br/>
(Get it)<br/>
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean<br/>
Maybe I need to stir up shit<br/>
Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me<br/>
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill<br/>
I should eat a pill, probably I will<br/>
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death<br/>
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath<br/>
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed<br/>
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)<br/>
<br/>
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick<br/>
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence<br/>
Bang it with a pipe wrench<br/>
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch<br/>
Like vice-president Mike Pence<br/>
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip<br/>
<br/>
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic<br/>
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and<br/>
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch?<br/>
(Fuck my side chick!)<br/>
<br/>
You won't ever see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C<br/>
I polarize shit so the temps might freeze<br/>
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it<br/>
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough<br/>
Nah, turn the valium up!<br/>
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut<br/>
Now, when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at<br/>
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks<br/>
You'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?<br/>
And now he wants to take it out on us"<br/>
(ooh-ooh)<br/>
<br/>
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy<br/>
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study<br/>
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh-ooh)<br/>
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that<br/>
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry<br/>
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me<br/>
<br/>
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'<br/>
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne<br/>
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name<br/>
I'm fed up with being humble<br/>
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings<br/>
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach<br/>
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo<br/>
The era that I'm from will pummel you<br/>
That's what it's comin' to<br/>
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?<br/>
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two<br/>
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner<br/>
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner<br/>
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it<br/>
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper<br/>
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's<br/>
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival<br/>
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider<br/>
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned<br/>
And you would have bought it<br/>
But sayin' I no longer got it<br/>
'Cause you missed a lot and never caught it<br/>
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it<br/>
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest<br/>
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist<br/>
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless<br/>
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest<br/>
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it<br/>
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic<br/>
With a bottle full of malt liquor<br/>
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer<br/>
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom<br/>
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet<br/>
I don't see why y'all even started with me<br/>
I get in beefs, my enemies die<br/>
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased<br/>
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'<br/>
Now you see why I don't sleep<br/>
Not even a wink, I don't blink<br/>
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats<br/>
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze<br/>
<br/>
"Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage<br/>
The Thing ain't even orangeâoh my God, that's a reach!"<br/>
Shout to all my colorblind people, each and every one of y'all<br/>
If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine<br/>
Or you think water is pink<br/>
"Dawg, that's a date," "Looks like an olive to me"<br/>
"Look, there's an apple!" "No it's not, it's a peach!"<br/>
<br/>
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang<br/>
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang<br/>
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway<br/>
Doesn't matter what I say<br/>
Give me Donkey of the Day<br/>
What a way for 2018 to get underway<br/>
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say<br/>
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)<br/>
Invite them in like a One A Day<br/>
I'm not done (preach)<br/>
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden<br/>
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?<br/>
'Cause the way I see people turning's<br/>
Is makin' it seem worthless<br/>
It's startin' to defeat the purpose<br/>
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds<br/>
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word<br/>
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict<br/>
Or still yet to be determined?<br/>
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshiped<br/>
But if I could go back I'd at least reword it<br/>
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent<br/>
Sold the dream to that he's deserted<br/>
<br/>
But I think it's workin'<br/>
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous<br/>
And he's too scurred to answer me with words<br/>
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered<br/>
But I know at least he's heard it<br/>
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service<br/>
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him<br/>
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists<br/>
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"<br/>
But my beef is more media journalists<br/>
(Hold up, hold up, hold upâ¦)<br/>
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist<br/>
Can get a mouthful of flesh<br/>
And, yes, I mean eating a penis<br/>
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death<br/>
So I been givin' the media fingers<br/>
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh<br/>
But they been puttin' me through the ringer<br/>
So, I ain't ironin' shit out with the press<br/>
But I just took this beat to the cleaners

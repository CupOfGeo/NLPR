<br/>
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave<br/>
And met a new wave blonde babe<br/>
With half of her head shaved<br/>
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up<br/>
With first aid tape and raped on the first date<br/>
Susan an ex-heroin addict who just stopped using<br/>
Who love booze and alternative music. What's up<br/>
Told me she was going back into using again<br/>
I said wait first try this hallucinogen<br/>
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze and the gin<br/>
Come here let's go in here<br/>
Who's in the den?<br/>
(It's me and Kelly)<br/>
My bad, sorry!<br/>
Let's try another room<br/>
"I don't trust you"<br/>
Shut up slut chew up this mushroom<br/>
This'll help you get in touch with your roots<br/>
We'll get bare-foot butt-naked and run in the woods<br/>
"Oh hell might as well try 'em this party is so drag."<br/>
Oh dang I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!<br/>
(huh)<br/>
<br/>
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl<br/>

But now you sitting in the corner crying<br/>
And now it's my fault my fault<br/>
I'm sorry!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
"Yo Sue!"<br/>
Get away from me, I don't know you<br/>
Oh shoot, she's tripping<br/>
I need to go puke! (Bleahh!)<br/>
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major<br/>
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature<br/>
Susan stop crying I don't hate ya<br/>
The world's not against you<br/>
I'm sorry your father raped ya<br/>
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth<br/>
That ain't no reason to start wigging and spaz out<br/>
She said "Help me I think I'm having a seizure!"<br/>
I said "I'm high too, bitch. Quit grabbing my T-shirt (let go!)<br/>
Would you calm down you're starting to scare me<br/>
She said "I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married<br/>
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook"<br/>
Hello<br/>
I'm over here Sue, hi, you're talking to the plant, look!<br/>
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late<br/>
'Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate<br/>
<br/>
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl<br/>
"Whoops!"<br/>
I never meant to bring you to my world<br/>
But now you sitting in the corner crying<br/>
And now it's my fault my fault<br/>
"It's an accident!"<br/>
<br/>
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl<br/>
I never meant to bring you to my world<br/>
But now you sitting in the corner crying<br/>
And now it's my fault my fault<br/>
<br/>
Susan (wait!) Where you going? You better be careful<br/>
Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of getting my hair pulled<br/>
I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue<br/>
Want some gum?<br/>
Put down the scissors, 'fore you do something dumb<br/>
I'll be right back just chill baby please?<br/>
I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these<br/>
(I'mma kill him!)<br/>
"John, where's Dave at before I bash you?"<br/>
He's in the bathroom; I think he's taking a crap dude!<br/>
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance<br/>
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants<br/>
Chopping her hair off<br/>
And there's only two days left of Spring Break<br/>
How long do these things take to wear off?"<br/>
Well it depends on how many you had?<br/>
I took three she ate the other twenty-two caps<br/>
Now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs<br/>
Drinking Lysol<br/>
"She's gonna die dude."<br/>
I know and it's my fault!<br/>
My god!<br/>
<br/>
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl<br/>
I never meant to bring you to my world<br/>
"I'm sorry!"<br/>
But now you sitting in the corner crying<br/>
And now it's my fault my fault<br/>
"What do I do?"<br/>
<br/>
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl<br/>
I never meant to bring you to my world<br/>
But now you sitting in the corner crying<br/>
And now it's my fault my fault<br/>
<br/>
My God, I'm so sorry!<br/>
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!<br/>
Please! Please wake up! What are you doing?!<br/>
You're not dead! You're not dead!<br/>
I know you're not dead!<br/>
Wake up<br/>

Oh my god

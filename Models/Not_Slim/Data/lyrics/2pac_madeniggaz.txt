<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
No man separate what we create<br/>
Unstoppable, untouchable<br/>
Motherfuckin' worldwide mob figures<br/>
Death Row at it's finest!<br/>
M.O.B., thug for motherfuckin' life<br/>
Motherfuckin' made niggas<br/>
We comin' after these niggas, worldwide<br/>
Feel me! Makaveli the Don<br/>
<br/>
My life in exchange for yours, born hated as a thug<br/>
House full of babies cryin' from a lack of gettin' love<br/>
Ain't nobody tell me shit, 'til I got a sack of drugs<br/>
Had the block sewn up, cause I learned to pack a gun<br/>
Do you feel me? World, do you hear me?<br/>
Catch a risin' star, fuck the love, niggas fear me<br/>
Got these niggas runnin' all wild from my double-R<br/>
When we ride, motherfuckers is sure to die<br/>
Boom once I enter the room, in the air<br/>
All you hear is the whispers of doom, niggas scared<br/>
They don't wanna see me head on<br/>
Think of all the busters that I had to leave dead and gone<br/>
Call a gravedigga, fuckin' with a made nigga<br/>
M.O.B, gunfire, gettin' sprayed quicker<br/>
Fuck 'em all, let 'em understand my plot to get richer<br/>
Much more than six figures, a motherfuckin' made nigga<br/>
<br/>
(Can you feel me?)<br/>
A motherfuckin' made nigga<br/>
I got a plot to get richer<br/>
Take my picture, a made nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Napoleon:]</i><br/>
Nigga, I was raised on the streets, I had to hustle just to eat<br/>
My role model was killin' niggas, so I know I would never be weak<br/>
They got me sittin' wonderin', where my life begins<br/>
These niggas crossed my father, then my father crossed them<br/>
'Cause I roll with Immortal Thug niggas<br/>
And my number one plan to kill a man<br/>
To grab a needle and drug niggas<br/>
Niggas don't like us, because they bitches straight love us<br/>
The President told us to leave<br/>
'Cause the government don't want us<br/>
It's Napoleon, I get my pleasure out of sin<br/>
And seein' blood spill ain't shit 'cause I seen it at the beginnin'<br/>
A made nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fatal Hussein:]</i><br/>
How many niggas fall in your vision?<br/>
Gunnin' 'em down for every last minute that I spent in prison<br/>
We mash together, plus we get cash together<br/>
Blast whenever, knowin' it don't last forever<br/>
It's only one way out and one way in<br/>
Motherfuckers cross and get crossed out, never made men<br/>
We find excuses to loot, cock, and shoot<br/>
Blow the roof off them groups like Rauf al-Mabhouh<br/>
I can't be touched, 'cause of the weapons I clutch<br/>
And the niggas that I'm under is just too much: we made niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[E.D.I. Mean:]</i><br/>
Picture the scenery, 'cause for now you gon' have to imagine<br/>
Call me your prophet 'cause I predicted what's gon' happen<br/>
I began the paper, stackin' at those who be paper snatchin'<br/>
Will emerge like crack in the 80's<br/>
Fade me? Maybe, that's if I slip<br/>
But I became official since the start of this<br/>
Edi Amin, born July, 7th, a few shed eyes, precious<br/>
But others gave me they hate to cherish<br/>
But still I made it, a made nigga made by the game<br/>
Made for war, my aim is simple and plain<br/>
Yeah, whether it's 'caine, or these tracks made for your brain<br/>
You'll forever know my name, Edi, a made nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kastro:]</i><br/>
I ain't count the line, my strap, my head<br/>
There will be none of that<br/>
The young hog, K-Dog playin' Outlaw Immortal combat<br/>
With the criminal skill, they cannot beat me a nigga<br/>
'Til he still and chill, recognize the real deal<br/>
Feel â a nigga made when I was young and dumb<br/>
With a gun, but it pays, so I'm bustin' for fun<br/>
And the outcome will be the same every time<br/>
We all gon' die, get yours 'cause I'ma get mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Khadafi:]</i><br/>
Tha Outlawz, we be the Don Juan's of this rough shit<br/>
Rhymes baptize your mind while paralyze the public<br/>
With my mentality of war<br/>
Dead bodies and silence, give it to you raw<br/>
Thug nigga to the core<br/>
The results of livin' poor, got me thinkin' on a made level<br/>
Shootin' my gauge to get paid, a fuckin' crazed devil<br/>
Mash shit from here to here, day by day, year to year<br/>
Made niggas on your motherfuckin' tear: I'm a made nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac:]</i><br/>
Call me a Bad Boy killer, murder motherfuckers daily<br/>
Know the feds trail me, so my alias Makaveli<br/>
Gettin' lessons from niggas in penitentiaries<br/>
Game, when applied, help me survive several centuries<br/>
Lock me in a cage, I'll display my rage<br/>
Surround the court buildin' with the gauge and spray<br/>
They wonder if I'll go when I'm finally sentenced<br/>
On my knees to God, beggin' for repentance<br/>
I'm so convinced that I'm a thug<br/>
They got me fiendin' for my cash<br/>
Like a fiend when he dreams of drugs<br/>
Diss the dada and I'll kidnap your daughter<br/>
Kill your wife and hit the funeral<br/>
And tell you just who gave the order<br/>
Makaveli the Don 'til I'm gone<br/>
I maintain my army of lunatics that stay armed<br/>
'Til the day I die, I'll be remembered as a paid nigga<br/>
Outlaw to the grave, a motherfuckin' made nigga<br/>
<br/>
Can you feel me? Come closer, ha ha ha<br/>
Get into the mind of a made nigga, I can't be touched<br/>
My adversaries get fucked, feel me?<br/>
Multimillionaire dreams<br/>
All I want is the C.R.E.A.M.<br/>
I sell my shit to the fiends, all the bitches scream<br/>
Come and see, to see a made nigga<br/>
Outlawz, Makaveli The Don<br/>
Hussein Fatal, Edi Amin, Kastro<br/>
Napoleon, Kadafi, Mussolini, M.O.B.<br/>
I send this out to my niggas on the streets<br/>
The motherfuckin' made niggas<br/>
All my niggas on Death Row, Tha Dogg Pound<br/>
Tha Doggfather, and all his niggas<br/>
You know what time it is<br/>
Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Young Gotti<br/>
(Hahaha, Westside made niggas, beyotch!!!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2Pac as a Police Officer &amp; Sergeant:]</i><br/>

We've got uhh 2Pac Shakur<br/>
Uhh Fatal, Fatal Husseinâ¦ uhh Kastro, Kadafi<br/>
We got a bunch of niggas here<br/>

They're with a lot of black women, what should we do, Sarge?<br/>
Uhh, I repeat, let 'em go<br/>
I repeat, let 'em go<br/>
They're made niggasâ¦ let 'em go<br/>
But, but Sarge, they've got guns, they've got weed<br/>

Alright, you guys can go, I'm sorry<br/>

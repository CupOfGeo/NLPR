You're drunk<br/>
The carpet is burned<br/>
I hate to find you like this<br/>
I always find you like this<br/>
I come home and clean up your mess<br/>
What would you do without that?<br/>
Why do I always come back? Oh<br/>
What I wouldn't do for you<br/>
<br/>
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me<br/>
Maybe you need me<br/>
Maybe you need-ed me<br/>
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me<br/>
Maybe you need me<br/>
Maybe you need-ed me<br/>

Some nights I want to run for the hills<br/>
It's never easy with you<br/>
I cannot reason with you<br/>
But your smile is as rare as it comes<br/>
What would I do without that<br/>
Maybe that's why I come back<br/>
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you<br/>
<br/>

And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me<br/>
Maybe you need me<br/>
Maybe you need-ed me<br/>

Starting to think we were made for each other<br/>
But one of us in this relationship is raising the other<br/>
You remind me of my mother<br/>
We drive one another crazy as each other<br/>
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse<br/>
For the games that we play with each other<br/>
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!<br/>
But I give her the benefit of the doubt<br/>
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her<br/>
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker<br/>
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble<br/>
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheating again<br/>
Give her another chance? Another one after that?<br/>
I'm swimming in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial<br/>
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eating grin when I smile<br/>
Making an excuse for us to act it out<br/>
She's just acting out with her inner child<br/>
Then I set the truth on fire<br/>
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie<br/>
Then I breathe a sigh of relief, I don't believe in<br/>
Going to bed mad, I keep on trying<br/>
To make a bad girl good<br/>
But haven't I stood by you in good times?<br/>
And bad? I'm starting to feel like your goddamn dad<br/>
'Cause I literally feel like you could die if ever should I<br/>
Leave you for good and never would I<br/>
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye<br/>
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy<br/>
And you're a good person too<br/>
I can save you, I can make you change<br/>
But I keep putting my fucking foot in my mouth<br/>
Every time I gotta come and bail you out<br/>
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in<br/>
And I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out<br/>
I could never turn my fucking back on youâwhat is that?<br/>
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticing it<br/>
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it<br/>
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart<br/>
Our apartment's tore apart<br/>
You're using my heart for a dartboard<br/>
But God must've aligned stars for us<br/>
'Cause somebody paired us up<br/>
And they say He ain't capable of making a mistake<br/>
But this one's perfect, 'cause I'mâ<br/>

And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me<br/>
Maybe you need me<br/>
Maybe you need-ed me<br/>
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me<br/>
Maybe you need me<br/>
Maybe you need-ed me

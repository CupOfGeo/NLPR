A lot of people ask me stupid fucking questions.<br/>
A lot of people think that what I say on a record or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life or that I believe in it.<br/>
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody that I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it.<br/>
Well, shit, if you believe that then I'll kill you.<br/>
You know why?<br/>
'Cause I'm a criminal<br/>
<br/>
Criminal<br/>
You're goddamn right<br/>
I'm a criminal<br/>
Yeah, I'm a criminal<br/>
<br/>
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge<br/>
That'll stab you in the head<br/>
Whether you're a fag or lez<br/>
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest<br/>
Pants or dress<br/>
Hate fags? The answer's "yes"<br/>
<br/>
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic<br/>
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging<br/>
That's my motherfucking balls,<br/>
You'd better let go of 'em<br/>
They belong in my scrotum,<br/>
You'll never get hold of 'em<br/>
<br/>
"Hey, it's me, Versace<br/>
Whoops, somebody shot me!<br/>
And I was just checking the mail."<br/>
Get it? Checking the 'male'?<br/>
<br/>
How many records you expecting to sell<br/>
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?<br/>
C'mon! Relax guy, I like gay men<br/>
Right, Ken? Give me an "amen". A-men!<br/>
<br/>
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus<br/>
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons<br/>
Oh, and please send me a brand new car<br/>
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital<br/>
<br/>
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher<br/>
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither<br/>
You can't teach me a goddamn thing<br/>
'Cause I watch TV, and Comcast cable<br/>
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts<br/>
You can't stop me from topping these charts<br/>
And you can't stop me from dropping each March<br/>
With a brand new CD for these fucking retards<br/>
And to think, it's just little ol' me<br/>
Mr. Don't-Give-A-Fuck still won't leave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
I'm a criminal<br/>
'Cause every time I write a rhyme,<br/>
These people think it's a crime<br/>
To tell 'em what's on my mind<br/>
I guess I'm a criminal<br/>
But I don't gotta say a word,<br/>
I just flip 'em the bird<br/>
And keep going, I don't take shit from no one<br/>
<br/>
My mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed<br/>
The baby came out disfigured, ligaments indeed<br/>
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she<br/>
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me<br/>
<br/>
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed<br/>
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?<br/>
So as I got older and I got a lot taller<br/>
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger<br/>
<br/>
I drink more liquor<br/>
To fuck you up quicker<br/>
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word ...<br/>
My morals went ... when the president got oral<br/>
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk<br/>
Off of his own employee<br/>
<br/>
Now don't ignore me,<br/>
You won't avoid me<br/>
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired<br/>
And my nose is pointy<br/>
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die<br/>
In plane crashes and laughs<br/>
As long as it ain't happened to him<br/>
<br/>
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined<br/>
"The Maniac's in" in place of the doctor<br/>
'Cause Dre couldn't make it today<br/>
He's a little under the weather,<br/>
So I'm taking his place<br/>
<br/>
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face<br/>
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place<br/>
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away<br/>
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?<br/>
I'm a criminal<br/>
<br/>
Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker<br/>
Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there<br/>
Aight<br/>
I'll be right here waiting on you<br/>
Aight<br/>
Yo Em<br/>
What?!<br/>
Don't kill nobody this time<br/>
Awwright. Goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fucking nerves<br/>
Aha?<br/>
How you doin'?<br/>
Hi, how can I help you?<br/>
Yeah I need to make a withdrawal<br/>
Okay<br/>
Put the fucking money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!<br/>
What? Oh my God, don't kill me<br/>
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit looking around.<br/>
Don't kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me, don't kill me<br/>
I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you<br/>
Hurry the fuck up! Thank you!<br/>
Go, go, go!<br/>
<br/>
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it<br/>
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it<br/>
So I'll be disguised in it<br/>
And if anybody identifies the guy in it<br/>
I'll hide for five minutes<br/>
<br/>
Come back, shoot the eyewitness<br/>
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business<br/>
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets<br/>
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet<br/>
<br/>
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts<br/>
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck<br/>
You motherfucking chickens ain't brave enough<br/>
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut<br/>
<br/>
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up<br/>
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass<br/>
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as<br/>
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask<br/>
<br/>
<i>[4x]</i><br/>
I'm a criminal<br/>
'Cause every time I write a rhyme,<br/>
These people think it's a crime<br/>
To tell 'em what's on my mind<br/>
I guess I'm a criminal<br/>
But I don't gotta say a word,<br/>
I just flip 'em the bird<br/>
And keep going, I don't take shit from no one

I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air<br/>
Stewardess complimentinâ me on my nappy hair<br/>
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers<br/>
Theyâll probâly think Iâm a terrorist<br/>
Eat my asparagus, then Iâm askinâ her<br/>
Thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom<br/>
A crash dummy for diamonds, I know you dyinâ to meet âem<br/>
Iâll probâly die in a minute<br/>
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a Comptown fitted<br/>
<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, big shit poppinâ<br/>
Section 80<br/>
<br/>
Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch<br/>
Witâ my back against the wall and yoâ bitch on the edge of my dick<br/>
Jump off<br/>
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman<br/>
I never did nothinâ but break the ground on top of the asphalt<br/>
Tire mark gave you evidence that Iâm easily peddlinâ with the speed of a lightninâ bolt<br/>
As a kid I killed two adults, Iâm too advanced<br/>
I live my twenties at two years old, the wiser man<br/>
Truth be told, Iâm like eighty-seven<br/>
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire witâ devils holdinâ hands<br/>
From the distance, donât know which one is a Christian, damn<br/>
Who can I trust in 2012? Thereâs no one<br/>
Not even myself, a Gemini screaminâ for help, somebody<br/>
<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, big shit poppinâ, everybody watchinâ<br/>
When you do it like this, nigga, losinâ ainât an option<br/>
<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, big shit poppinâ<br/>
(Ay, ay, kick her out the studio, Ali)<br/>
<br/>
24/7 nigga, workinâ his ass for it, she poppinâ that ass for it<br/>
The King of Diamonds witâ diamonds I never do ask for<br/>
They checkinâ my passport, Iâm too accustomed with Customs<br/>
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff âim<br/>
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain<br/>
When you niggas is past poor, youâll never hop in my lane<br/>
When you pushinâ a RAV4, you wreckinâ my Jaguar<br/>
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard<br/>
<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, big shit poppinâ, everybody watchinâ<br/>
When you do it like this, nigga, losinâ ainât an option<br/>
<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
Holâ up (Holâ up)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, big shit poppinâ, everybody watchinâ<br/>
When you do it like this, niggaâ¦<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air<br/>
Stewardess complimentinâ me on my nappy hair<br/>
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers<br/>
Theyâll probâly think Iâm Osama<br/>
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor<br/>
<br/>
Holâ up

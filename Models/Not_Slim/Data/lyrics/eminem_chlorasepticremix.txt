<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
2 Chainz!<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Take 'em to church, I'm talkin' the tabernacle<br/>
It's the return of the body snatcher<br/>
Walk in the spot, make my woman smack ya (whoo!)<br/>
In a fruit fight, I aim at your Adam's apple<br/>
Pull up in the candy car, eatin' a candy bar<br/>
And my girl eatin' a candy apple<br/>
Yeah (mm), I line their ass up (up)<br/>
I aim at their goozer (baow!)<br/>
All of these stones on my neck, uh<br/>
They must have looked at Medusa<br/>
Pockets Rasputia of course<br/>
I drove some rims to court<br/>
I fucked some twins before<br/>
I had a Benz before, this is the sin report<br/>
This is the murder, murder, pass the burner, Em (uh)<br/>
Your money shorter than an acronym (ayy)<br/>
Big body when I'm backin' in (whoo!)<br/>
Ladi-dadi, got a bunch of bodies<br/>
Niggas fakin', niggas human traffickin' (whoo!)<br/>
I'm on the Act' again, uh<br/>
This ain't a accident, uh<br/>
King like Ak-Ron<br/>
I run the trap again, you on the treadmill (treadmill)<br/>
Never Neverland, shit came with a Ferris wheel (goddamn!)<br/>
Ferris day off, baby, AR in the same car<br/>
Most of y'all my sons, aww, look at little JR<br/>
F12 same color Kate Moss<br/>
Uh, I'm talkin' wristin' the pot<br/>
I'm talkin' this and you not<br/>
I'm talkin' bricks and you not<br/>
I'm talkin' straight up and down, nigga, like 6 o'clock<br/>
This is the equinox, this what the people want<br/>
Somebody at the door, I heard the speaker knock, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[PHresher:]</i><br/>
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic<br/>
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with<br/>
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit<br/>
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors<br/>
These bitches got flavors<br/>
They all wanna smoke but ain't doin' no labor<br/>
But they shoppin' at Raleys, they stingin' like tasers<br/>
Act Hollywood like they play for the Lakers<br/>
They fly on the latest<br/>
Crocs, alligators, say hi to my haters<br/>
Pardon my neighbor<br/>
We eatin' that chicken, lobster, potatoes<br/>
You must be sniffin' that yayo<br/>
If you don't think I'm that nigga<br/>
Swagger on ten since a day old<br/>
It's a-okay though, whippin' up whip like it's mayo<br/>
Every track is a K.O., technical K.O.<br/>
Go off your head like I'm Ayo<br/>
Out of this world, talkin' NATO<br/>
It's 'cause of jail, ho, don't be an A-hole<br/>
'Cause I got shooters that shoot when I say so (lay low!)<br/>
Wanna be in my shoes, you ain't paid no dues<br/>
Real nigga, you ain't break no rules (hell yeah!)<br/>
High school, niggas ate yo' food<br/>
Might dumb it down a little, but I ain't no fool (hell yeah!)<br/>
Niggas hate every day, B (yeah)<br/>
Shit is O.C. lately (yeah)<br/>
Gotta break 'em off with these Dre beats (yeah)<br/>
Or I might go crazy (hell yeah!)<br/>
These niggas too goddamn lazy (too lazy)<br/>
Don't ever, ever, ever try to play me (to play me)<br/>
Lil' shawty now comin' from BK (BK)<br/>
But I'm tryna come up like JAY-Z (like JAY-Z)<br/>
Nothin' but love for my idols (love for my idols)<br/>
I feel entitled to titles (to titles)<br/>
Fuck it, man, I want the title (I want the title)<br/>
Submission, they goin' all viral<br/>
<br/>
Like Chloraseptic, 'septic<br/>
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with<br/>
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit<br/>
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (hell yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Bin Laden with a pen, bodyin' again<br/>
I begin slaughterin' your men, prolly shoulda been<br/>
Ali or the Svengali embodiment of sin<br/>
Like a Saudi in the Taliban plotting an event<br/>
In the lobby of the Intercontinental with an obvious intent<br/>
And I would not even relent<br/>
Up on a little like Osama with a bomb under the bin<br/>
And down the middle of the Pentagon<br/>
And hit a kindergartener with a rental (stop!)<br/>
Back and forth, back and forth<br/>
Like Jack Kevorkian's ass to court<br/>
"Rap mature! Why can't you be like Macklemore?" (huh?)<br/>
"Why you always gotta smack a whore?" (huh?)<br/>
It's likely the psychiatric ward's a last resort (huh?)<br/>
Something's gotta give, that's for sure<br/>
Yet you keep comin' back for more<br/>
Not as raw as I was, â'Walk On Water' sucksâ<br/>
Bitch, suck my dick!<br/>
Y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit 'fore you heard it<br/>
So you formed your verdict<br/>
While you sat with your arms crossed<br/>
Did your little reaction videos and talked over songs (chill!)<br/>
Nah dog, y'all sayin' I lost it?<br/>
Your fuckin' marbles are gone (wait, Em!)<br/>
But nowadays, every flow, every cadence sound the same (skrrt)<br/>
Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration outta hate<br/>
Real pain in the paper, I don't trace<br/>
But if I look strange and outta place<br/>
It's 'cause I'm an alien, that's why I write 'til the page is outta space<br/>
Yeah, from 7 Mile in Novara<br/>
To "How can I be down?", all of us tryna pile in the car (yeah!)<br/>
We shot for the stars (yeah!)<br/>
'Cause we only got so much time in this world (yeah!)<br/>
So rewind it to your high school dance to the night before<br/>
If you think you're promised tomorrow (yeah!)<br/>
Now I'm 'bout to fool again<br/>
This tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit<br/>
A freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip<br/>
And I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick<br/>
If I was you, I wouldn't do nothin' stupid due to the mood I'm in<br/>
I'm losin' it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint<br/>
Show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed<br/>
Empty the lubricant and put super glue in it (woo!)<br/>
How many fuckin' rappers did I go through?<br/>
Dispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked<br/>
And you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit<br/>
But am I s'posed to sound like everything else out?<br/>
'Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now<br/>
And I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down<br/>
But the only way I care is if I let myself down<br/>
But what the fuck have I woke to?<br/>
Time to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools<br/>
I know you still want me to ill out, don't you?<br/>
Hopin' the old Slim's gonna spill out, open<br/>
Fire on your whole camp with this spit, I roast you<br/>
So chill out, no, you<br/>
Hoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you<br/>
Then I took a stand<br/>
Went at Tan-Face and practically cut my motherfuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you<br/>
You just called my shit trash?<br/>
Thank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked<br/>
"Revival's wack, I don't like the 'Zombie' track<br/>
And when he's talkin' that garbage psychotic crap<br/>
Where's your content at?<br/>
What's with all the conscious rap?<br/>
P!nk, BeyoncÃ© this and Kehlani that" (yeah!)<br/>
I just add it to the fuel in my rocket pack<br/>
'Til I'm ready to respond, then I'ma launch it at 'em<br/>
Idiotic from the fuckin' embryonic sac<br/>
To the body bag, I'll be back<br/>
And when I am, I'll be at your fuckin' throat likeâ<br/>
<br/>

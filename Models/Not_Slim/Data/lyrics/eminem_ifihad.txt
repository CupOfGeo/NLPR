Life by Marshall Mathers<br/>
What is life?<br/>
Life is like a big obstacle<br/>
Put in front of your optical to slow you down<br/>
And every time you think you've gotten past it<br/>
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground<br/>
What are friends?<br/>
Friends are people that you think are your friends<br/>
But they're really your enemies, with secret identities<br/>
And disguises, to hide their true colors<br/>
So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers<br/>
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'<br/>
What is money?<br/>
Money is what makes a man act funny<br/>
Money is the root of all evil<br/>
Money'll make them same friends come back around<br/>
Swearing that they was always down<br/>
What is life?<br/>
I'm tired of life<br/>
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins<br/>
I'm tired of committing so many sins<br/>
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins<br/>
Tired of never having any ends<br/>
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins<br/>
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins<br/>
Tired of not having a deal<br/>
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel<br/>
Tired of drowning in my sorrow<br/>
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo<br/>
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off<br/>
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour<br/>
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off<br/>
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough<br/>
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk<br/>
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk<br/>
I'm tired of using plastic silverware<br/>
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square<br/>
Tired of not being a millionaire<br/>
<br/>
But if I had a million dollars<br/>
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics<br/>
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick<br/>
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john<br/>
If I had a million bucks<br/>
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out<br/>
Robbing armored trucks<br/>
If I had one wish<br/>
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss<br/>
<br/>
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor<br/>
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store<br/>
I'm tired of not having a phone<br/>
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on<br/>
Tired of not driving a BM<br/>
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him<br/>
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM<br/>
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum<br/>
Tired of not being on tour<br/>
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work<br/>
In the back of a Contour<br/>
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones<br/>
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns<br/>
Tired of being stared at<br/>
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat<br/>
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz<br/>
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs<br/>
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me<br/>
Saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"<br/>
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs<br/>
Tired of JLB saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"<br/>
<br/>
But if I had a million dollars<br/>
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics<br/>
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick<br/>
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john<br/>
If I had a million bucks<br/>
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out<br/>
Robbing armored trucks<br/>
If I had one wish<br/>
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss<br/>
<br/>
You know what I'm saying?<br/>
I'm tired of all of this bullshit<br/>
Telling me to be positive<br/>
How'm I supposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?<br/>
Know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
I rap about shit around me, shit I see<br/>
Know what I'm sayin'? Right now I'm tired of everything<br/>
Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city<br/>
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'<br/>
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
Just fed up<br/>
That's my word

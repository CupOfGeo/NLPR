Here we go again from heroes to villains<br/>
Used to be your Romeo but we both were jilted<br/>
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with<br/>
But still it gave me hope that we'll get<br/>
Through it together, a severed earlobe<br/>
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-elope would be dope<br/>
But what kind of lengths can you go?<br/>
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho<br/>
To be a housewife who outright lies<br/>
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive<br/>
I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?<br/>
She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice<br/>
Guys, when someone you'd die for<br/>
Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?<br/>
Another late night in, she stumbles through my door<br/>
Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more<br/>
And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers<br/>
To plant the K-Y in; I'm gettin' accused by a whore<br/>
Who smells like St. Ides and who's probably screwed five more<br/>
Guys, sucked eight/nine men<br/>
I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens<br/>
Bitch it's you I tore out the frame, I win<br/>
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in<br/>
And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends<br/>
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels<br/>
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?<br/>
I'm waitin' for the day I can<br/>
Hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been!<br/>
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him"<br/>
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him<br/>
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in<br/>
After you, I swore to make the gray skies end<br/>
Here come the rays, like when you get a pay hike and<br/>
Am I the good guy or do I just play like him<br/>
And hope that he dumps you?<br/>
It's like a dream come true, just to scream "Fuck you!"<br/>
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then<br/>
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in<br/>
Since<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jessie Reyez:]</i><br/>
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty<br/>
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me<br/>
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever<br/>
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy<br/>
'Cause this ain't what love looks like<br/>
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever<br/>
I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy<br/>
They like, "You're the good guy," they like, they like<br/>
They like, "You're the good guy"

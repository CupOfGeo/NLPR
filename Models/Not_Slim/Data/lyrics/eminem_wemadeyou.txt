Guess who? Did you miss me?<br/>
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!<br/>
<br/>
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)<br/>
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)<br/>
You're a rock star (Baby!)<br/>
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)<br/>
Player!<br/>
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)<br/>
We're the ones who made you!<br/>
<br/>
Back by popular demand<br/>
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can<br/>
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand<br/>
How does it feel: Is it fantastic, is it grand?<br/>
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands<br/>
Shady man, no, don't massacre the fans<br/>
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man<br/>
She stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands<br/>
On her massive gluteus maximus again<br/>
Squeeze it then squash it then pass it to a friend<br/>
Can he come back as nasty as he can?<br/>
Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again<br/>
He does not mean to lesbian offend<br/>
But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men<br/>
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten<br/>
I know you want me girl, in fact I see ya grin<br/>
Now come in girl!<br/>
<br/>
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)<br/>
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)<br/>
You're a rock star (Baby!)<br/>
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)<br/>
Player!<br/>
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)<br/>
We're the ones who made you!<br/>
<br/>
The enforcer, look at the more women to torture<br/>
Walk up to the cutest girl and charlie-horse her<br/>
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres<br/>
Have that I don't? Are you tellin' me tenderness?<br/>
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman<br/>
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine<br/>
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then<br/>
Nail her, "Baby, say hello to my little friend"<br/>
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middleman<br/>
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again<br/>
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge<br/>
Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention<br/>
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench<br/>
Man, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch<br/>
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim's<br/>
<br/>
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)<br/>
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)<br/>

Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)<br/>
Player!<br/>
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)<br/>
We're the ones who made you!<br/>
<br/>
And that's why, my love, you never live without<br/>
I know you want me girl<br/>
'Cause I can see you're checkin' me out<br/>
And baby, you know, you know you want me too<br/>
Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you<br/>
<br/>
Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa<br/>
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?<br/>
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album<br/>
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia<br/>
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with ya gal but<br/>
Jessica Alba, put a breast on my mouth, bruh<br/>
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers<br/>
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis<br/>
Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt<br/>
Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit<br/>
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica<br/>
Rest assured, Superman's here to rescue ya<br/>
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake<br/>
Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake<br/>
With a sawblade in it to make my jailbreak<br/>
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate<br/>
Now break it down, girl!<br/>
<br/>
When you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)<br/>
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)<br/>
You're a rock star (Baby!)<br/>
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)<br/>
Player!<br/>
Who could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)<br/>
We're the ones who made you!<br/>
<br/>
So baby, baby<br/>
Get down, down, down (Baby!)<br/>
Get down, down, down (Baby!)<br/>
Get down, down, down (Baby!)<br/>
Get down, get down (Baby!)<br/>
Get down, down, down (Baby!)<br/>
Get down, down, down (Baby!)<br/>
Get down, down, down (Baby!)<br/>
Get down, get down<br/>
<br/>
Oh Amy!<br/>
Rehab never looked so good!<br/>
I can't wait!<br/>
I'm going back!<br/>
Ha ha! Woo!<br/>

Oh, lord, oh, lord<br/>
Pretty ass girl over there, come play on ma nappy hair! <i>[*laughs*]</i><br/>
Drizzy Drake, here we go, look<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, I'm gettin' it how I live, I put that on my left rib<br/>
25 with no kids but this dick you can babysit<br/>
24 lighters in the sky, what life is a real nigga<br/>
20 Al-Qaeda bomb when I do sight 'fore I kill niggas<br/>
Passion my preference, Benjamin Franklin my medicine<br/>
The MVP let him in, I'ma fuck up his letterman jackets with pendants on them<br/>
And i got plenty war story, politic never depended on 'em<br/>
Uncle Sam never did shit for me, momma made miracles<br/>
Choppers drove me hysterical, cartoons and cereal<br/>
Pyramids on imburial, that's the projects<br/>
And I make that progress from a tedious process<br/>
I'm a problem better yet a prospect, fuck that I'm a Loch Ness monster<br/>
Conqueror, Compton, Hail King K-Dot, aka <i>[?]</i>, compensate for shooting for the stars muhafucka, click, brrt<br/>
<br/>
Shooting up the charts, muhfucka<br/>
See, a rich <i>[?]</i> could buy anything that you sell 'em<br/>
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell 'em<br/>
I let smokers pump my gas, but I do that very seldom<br/>
Drop your ass at the unemployment, the only way I help 'em<br/>
They call me a role model, I'm still a baby myself<br/>
Hungover from last night, got us speaking till school at 12<br/>
Hennessy with the Sprite got me bouncing like Rumplestiltskin<br/>
They caught me rummaging through women, I'm laughing like Elliott Wilson <i>[*Elliott Wilson's laugh*]</i><br/>
Pay me respect and pay me on my checks<br/>
My first 50 thousand collected paid off some street debts<br/>
You know killers that looked out for me back when I was hungry<br/>
We go back like Reebok classics and black and blue <i>[?]</i><br/>
I got a genuine clean slate, never you ask for my fucking weight<br/>
Never I'm handing out favors, bitch, every show now is 200k<br/>
As I write down my new bucket list, I can look down on your fucking hate<br/>
Get the fuck up when I'm in your presence, you listen when I fucking say<br/>
"What the fuck you niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God!<br/>
Huh? Huh? Drizzy<br/>
What the fuck these niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God!"

"I done told you that"<br/>

I said, oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?<br/>

Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs<br/>
Something to inspire me, rather than society's<br/>
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love<br/>
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club<br/>
I used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school that was '05<br/>
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then, I had no job<br/>
Pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans<br/>
Trust me these niggas rushed me for somethin my cousin prolly did<br/>
Guilty by association: story of my life, nigga<br/>
You gon make me flip and split yo shit just give me life, nigga<br/>
Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie's Burgers<br/>
Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go, drenched my pullover<br/>
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin, margin<br/>
Maintaining my modest modus as I dream<br/>
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it<br/>
Life itself, I know what helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry<br/>
("Hey what's up daddy?")<br/>
<br/>
I'm going through something with life<br/>
But pussy and Patron make you feel alright<br/>
Pussy and Patron make you feel alright<br/>

"So what'd you rush me out here for?<br/>
How was your day? Are you tipsy?"<br/>
"Mhm!"<br/>
<br/>

All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patron<br/>
Give me that, once you give me that, once again it's on<br/>
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that screw<br/>
Coming down clean, tell your baby momma what it do?<br/>
Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is?<br/>
Go on poke it out, situate your little positives<br/>
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready<br/>
I'mma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me...<br/>
<br/>
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff<br/>
I can't get enough, if I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe<br/>
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff<br/>
I can't get enough if I offend you...<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home<br/>
And caught that flat, in the mean T Flats<br/>
And it made me think if we could blink<br/>
To change locations where we at<br/>
We often get lost in the alcohol bottle<br/>
In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow<br/>
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit<br/>
Your car note due and you 'bout to get evicted<br/>
Two drugs surely, Patron, pussy, make it feel alright<br/>
But once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life<br/>
You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga<br/>
The antidote wouldn't last and you knew it, nigga<br/>
But still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign<br/>
<br/>
I'm going through something with life<br/>
But pussy and Patron make you feel alright<br/>
Pussy and Patron make you feel alright<br/>

Okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?<br/>
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram<br/>
Crackers watch my every step, man I hate to work for them<br/>
One time I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me<br/>
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man<br/>
What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it<br/>
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open<br/>
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open<br/>
(Soul!) Balls deep, ya dig? Retrieve, relief, ya dig?<br/>
Let's kill a bottle of tequila<br/>
And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?<br/>
What's up? I had a long day and I really wanna fuck<br/>
Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day<br/>
'Cause all I've been thinking the whole day...<br/>
<br/>

People! It feels so good to be back<br/>
Ladies and gentleman, introducing the new and improved you know who<br/>
<br/>
Never been the type to bend or budge<br/>
The wrong button to push<br/>
No friend of Bush<br/>
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese<br/>
I'm a pitbull off his leash<br/>
All this peace talk can cease<br/>
All these people I had to leave in limbo<br/>
I'm back now<br/>
I've come to release this info<br/>
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple<br/>
Can-I-Bitch don't want no beef with Slim?<br/>
No!<br/>
Not even on my radar<br/>
So won't you please jump off my dick<br/>
Lay off and stay off<br/>
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos from seance to seance<br/>
Aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw<br/>
<br/>
You all c'mon now<br/>
Let's all get on down<br/>
Let's do-si-do now<br/>
We're gon' have a good old time<br/>
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about<br/>
Let your hair down<br/>
And square dance with me!<br/>
<br/>
Let your hair down to the track<br/>
Yeah kick on back<br/>
Boo!<br/>
The boogie monster of rap<br/>
Yeah the man's back<br/>
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration<br/>
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation<br/>
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like<br/>
This white hot light<br/>
That I'm under<br/>
No wonder<br/>
I look so sunburnt<br/>
Oh no<br/>
I won't leave no stone unturned<br/>
Oh no I won't leave<br/>
Won't go nowhere<br/>
Do-si-do<br/>
Oh, yo, ho, hello there<br/>
Oh yeah don't think I won't go there<br/>
Go to Beirut and do a show there<br/>
Yeah you laugh 'til your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted<br/>
While you're at band camp thinkin' that crap can't happen<br/>
Till you fuck around<br/>
Get an anthrax napkin<br/>
Inside a package wrapped in saran Wrap wrapping<br/>
Open the plastic and then you stand back gasping<br/>
Fuckin' assassins hi-jackin' Amtraks crashing<br/>
All this terror America demands action<br/>
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'<br/>
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy<br/>
You just a baby<br/>
Gettin' recruited at eighteen<br/>
You're on a plane now<br/>
Eating their food and their baked beans<br/>
I'm 28<br/>
They gonna take you 'fore they take me<br/>
Crazy insane or insane crazy?<br/>
When I say Hussein you say Shady<br/>
My views ain't changed still Inhumane<br/>
Wait<br/>
Arraigned two days late<br/>
The date's today<br/>
Hang me!<br/>
<br/>
You all c'mon now<br/>
Let's all get on down<br/>
Let's do-si-do now<br/>
We're gon' have a good old time<br/>
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about<br/>
Let your hair down<br/>
And square dance with me!<br/>

<br/>
Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me<br/>
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove<br/>
that boosts me<br/>
Nothin' boosts me more<br/>
Or suits me beautifully<br/>
There's nothin' you can do to me<br/>
Stab me<br/>
Shoot me<br/>
Psychotic<br/>
Hypnotic, product I got the antibiotic<br/>
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada<br/>
God I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la<br/>
oochie walla walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta<br/>
Keep movin'<br/>
There's more music to make<br/>
Keep makin' new shit<br/>
Produce hits to break<br/>
the monotony<br/>
What's gotten into me?<br/>
Drugs, rock and Hennessy<br/>
Thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies<br/>
On your knees<br/>
Got you under siege<br/>
Somebody you would give a lung to be hungry<br/>
Like a fuckin' younger me<br/>
Fuck the fee<br/>
I can get you jumped for free<br/>
Yeah buddy<br/>
Laugh it's funny<br/>
I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothing<br/>
I'm past bluffing<br/>
Pass the K-Y<br/>
Let's get ready for some intense<br/>
serious ass fucking!<br/>
<br/>
You all c'mon now<br/>
Let's all get on down<br/>
Let's do-si-do now<br/>
We're gon' have a good old time<br/>
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothing to worry about<br/>
Let your hair down<br/>
And square dance with me!<br/>

<i>[Kendrick Lamar + ScHoolBoy Q:]</i><br/>
If Pirus and Crips all got along<br/>
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song<br/>
Seem like the whole city go against me<br/>
Every time I'm in the street, I hear<br/>
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!<br/>
<br/>
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"<br/>
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"<br/>
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"<br/>
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane<br/>
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine<br/>
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain<br/>
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain<br/>
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans<br/>
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window â check yourself!<br/>
Uh, Warriors and Conans, Hope euphoria can slow dance<br/>
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed<br/>
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out<br/>
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out<br/>
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it<br/>
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different<br/>
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine<br/>
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime<br/>
Pack a van with four guns at a time<br/>
With the sliding door, fuck is up?<br/>
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?<br/>
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers<br/>
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch<br/>
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all, duck!"<br/>
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch<br/>
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose<br/>
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!<br/>
Now crawl your head in that noose<br/>
You wind up dead on the news<br/>
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve<br/>
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's<br/>
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys<br/>
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct<br/>
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect<br/>
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except<br/>
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat<br/>
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC<br/>
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess<br/>
M.A.A.d city<br/>
<br/>
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"<br/>
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"<br/>
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"<br/>
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"<br/>

Wake yo' punk-ass up!<br/>
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang<br/>
G-yeah, real simple and plain<br/>
Let me teach you some lessons about the street<br/>
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)<br/>
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)<br/>
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang<br/>
G-yeah, how we do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad<br/>
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad<br/>
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash<br/>
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed<br/>
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him<br/>
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'<br/>
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends<br/>
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in<br/>
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up<br/>
Cocaine laced in marijuana<br/>
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now<br/>
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth<br/>
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even<br/>
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'<br/>
You know the reasons but still will never know my life<br/>
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[MC Eiht:]</i><br/>
G-yeah, cocaine, weed<br/>
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc<br/>
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds<br/>
Dip, make a nigga flip<br/>
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit<br/>
One time's crooked and shit<br/>
Block a nigga in<br/>
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton<br/>
<br/>
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool<br/>
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules<br/>
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang<br/>
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang<br/>
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me<br/>
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately<br/>
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can<br/>
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran<br/>
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave<br/>
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave<br/>
Mount up, regulators in the whip<br/>
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip<br/>
Trip, we in the hood still<br/>
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real<br/>
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand<br/>
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?<br/>
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street<br/>
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?<br/>
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?<br/>
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?<br/>
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep<br/>
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor<br/>
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage<br/>
Kill 'em all if they gossip<br/>
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option<br/>
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins<br/>
Constantly drinkin' and drive<br/>
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye<br/>
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide<br/>
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes<br/>
Probably go to the projects, I<br/>
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA<br/>
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Scratches]</i><br/>
M.A.A.d city<br/>
Compton<br/>
<br/>
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!<br/>
You ain't the one that got fucked up<br/>
What you holdin' it for?<br/>
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit<br/>
Nigga, that ain't no word<br/>
Nigga, shut up!<br/>
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?<br/>
Don't even trip<br/>
Just lay back and drink that

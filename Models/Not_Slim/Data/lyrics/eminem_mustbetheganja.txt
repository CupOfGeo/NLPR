Yea, (oh, oh), yea yea, oh<br/>
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing<br/>
I smell something in the air that's making me high<br/>
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high<br/>
<br/>
(Ok here we go) do-re-me-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti-da-so<br/>
Lyrical rascal, kick back the Tabasco<br/>
You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so<br/>
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos<br/>
Picasso with a pick axe, a sick asshole<br/>
Tic-tac-toe comes with six-pack with Exacto<br/>
Knives, strangling wives with thick lasso<br/>
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so<br/>
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones<br/>
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know<br/>
You do not want to try this at home, my lil' vato<br/>
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho<br/>
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos<br/>
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow<br/>
It's not what you expected, not what you thought, so<br/>
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke<br/>
<br/>
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana<br/>
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high<br/>
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me<br/>
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind<br/>
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana<br/>
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high<br/>
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me<br/>
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind<br/>
<br/>
Your dreams are getting fulfilled, ooh I'm literally getting a chill<br/>
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill<br/>
You're submitting to skill, sitting still<br/>
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real<br/>
Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama<br/>
And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of Jeffrey Dahmer<br/>
Please don't upset me, mama, you're looking sexy, mama<br/>
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama<br/>
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer<br/>
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza<br/>
How many people you know<br/>
Who can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row?<br/>
Put 'em in chronological order, beginning with Jack the Ripper<br/>
Name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper<br/>
Location of the woods<br/>
Where the body was dragged and then dumped<br/>
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate<br/>
And which model, which lake they found her in<br/>
How they attacked the victim<br/>
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one<br/>
Which knife and which gun, hat kid, what wife, and which nun<br/>
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fucking night's just begun<br/>
<br/>
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana<br/>
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high<br/>
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me<br/>
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind<br/>
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana<br/>
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high<br/>
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me<br/>
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind<br/>
<br/>
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like<br/>
You're stuck with the same stick that your tryin' to light<br/>
Behind the boards sits Dre, legends are made this way<br/>
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?<br/>
Maybe you need some lyric serum syrup for your symptoms<br/>
Here's a dosage of the antidote now you give him some<br/>
He can give her some, she can give them some, get behind a Linn Drum<br/>
Make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome<br/>
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some<br/>
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the endin' of<br/>
Capable of winning a Pulitzer so unbelievable it's a<br/>
Titanium cranium that's full of sur-<br/>
Prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes<br/>
You stare into your stereos high<br/>
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing<br/>
I ain't even smoke anything I ain't even drinking<br/>
<br/>
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana<br/>
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high<br/>
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me<br/>
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind<br/>
It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana<br/>
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high<br/>
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me<br/>
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

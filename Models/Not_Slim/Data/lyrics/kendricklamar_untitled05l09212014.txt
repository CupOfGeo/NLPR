<i>[Anna Wise &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor<br/>
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal<br/>
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
And that means the world to me<br/>
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor<br/>
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal<br/>
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow<br/>
And this I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk<br/>
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk<br/>
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular Iâm drunk<br/>
How can I can make them popular, pop emâ when I want<br/>
See Iâm livinâ with anxiety, duckinâ the sobriety<br/>
Fuckinâ up the system I ainât fuckinâ with society<br/>
Justice ainât free, therefore justice ainât me<br/>
So I justify his name on obituary<br/>
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?<br/>
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God<br/>
Now Iâm thinkinâ to myself, hollow tips is all I got<br/>
Now Iâm drinkinâ by myself, at the intersection, parked<br/>
Watch you when you walk inside your house<br/>
You threw your briefcase all on the couch<br/>
I plan on creeping through your fuckinâ door and blowinâ out<br/>
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms<br/>
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain<br/>
Iâm gone<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Punch &amp; Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippinâ the handle<br/>
Lit off henny, Iâm tryna dismantle<br/>
These wicked ways, Iâve engaged in such a gamble<br/>
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait<br/>
Thatâs a bit ambitious maybe Iâm trippinâ<br/>
Maybe Iâm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension<br/>
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance<br/>
Itâs such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night<br/>
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall<br/>
Studied the son of God but still donât recognize my flaws<br/>
I guess Iâm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful<br/>
I pray my experience helps you<br/>
As for me Iâm tryna sort it out<br/>
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul<br/>
But who knows?<br/>
I just need a little space to breathe<br/>
I know perception is key, so I am king<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind<br/>
The borderline between insanity is father time<br/>
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that Iâm blind<br/>
I know that Iâm intelligence, my confidence just died<br/>
Carpe diem, seize the day, I canât compromise<br/>
A tape worm couldnât cure this gluttonous appetite<br/>
A couple trinkets, they seein me as I pacify<br/>
But couldnât fathom the meaning of seeinâ sacrifice<br/>
Iâm passinâ lives on a daily, maybe Iâm losing faith<br/>
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate<br/>
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date<br/>
Professional dream killers reason why Iâm awake<br/>
Iâm sleep walkinâ, Iâm street stalkinâ, Iâm outta place<br/>
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes<br/>
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates?<br/>
Or this is just a mirage or a facade<br/>
Wait

Yeah. You know?.. Critics, man<br/>
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man<br/>
You know the one thing I notice about critics, man?<br/>
Is critics never ask me how my day went<br/>
Well I'mma tell 'em<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my dog died, I hog-tied a ho, tied her in a bow<br/>
Said, "Next time you blog, try to spit a flow."<br/>
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'<br/>
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole<br/>
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro<br/>
Better hold on a little tighter here I go<br/>
Flows tighter, hot headed as Ghost Rider<br/>
Cold-hearted as Spiderman throwing a spider in the snow<br/>
So you better get lower than Flo-Rida inside of a lowrider with no tires in the hole<br/>
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?<br/>
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?<br/>
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets<br/>
This isn't golf this is a blisterin' assault<br/>
Those are your wounds this is the salt<br/>
So get lost<br/>
Shit dissing me is just like pissing off the Wizard of Oz<br/>
Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it<br/>
Grab the scissors and saws and<br/>
Cut out your livers gizzards and balls<br/>
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with Jaws<br/>
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw<br/>
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all<br/>
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers<br/>
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog<br/>
<br/>
You're on fire<br/>
That's how you know you're on a roll<br/>
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold<br/>
You're on fire<br/>
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick I got ambulances pulling me over and shit<br/>
You're on fire<br/>
You need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop Shop to blow<br/>
You're on fire, you're on fire<br/>
<br/>
I just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses if you mistook this for a song, look<br/>
This ain't a song it's a warning to Brooke, Hogan and David Cook<br/>
That the crook just took over so book<br/>
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it<br/>
I'm lightning in a skillet you're a fuckin' flash in a pan<br/>
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan<br/>
Mr Mathers is the man<br/>
Yeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can<br/>
Come back and whip your ass with it again<br/>
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand it'll eat through anything metal the ass of Iron Man<br/>
Turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine<br/>
Yeah ask Denaun, man<br/>
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon<br/>
Fuck it I ain't playing<br/>
Pull up in a van and hop out on a homeless man holding a sign saying,<br/>
"Vietnam vet," I'm out my fuckin' mind, man<br/>
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand<br/>
So if I seem a little mean to you this ain't savage you ain't never seen a brute<br/>
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route<br/>
You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop<br/>
Saying you sick quit playing you prick don't nobody care<br/>
Then why the fuck am I yelling at air<br/>
I ain't even talking to no one 'cause ain't nobody there<br/>
Nobody will fuckin' test me 'cause these hos won't even dare<br/>
I'm wasting punchlines but I got so many to spare I just thought of another one that might go here<br/>
Naw don't waste it save it psycho yeah<br/>
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair<br/>
<br/>
You're on fire<br/>
That's how you know you're on a roll<br/>
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold<br/>
You're on fire<br/>
Man, I'm so hot my motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie<br/>
You're on fire<br/>
You need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit to give the whole Hip-Hop Shop to blow<br/>
You're on fire, you're on fire<br/>
You're on fire

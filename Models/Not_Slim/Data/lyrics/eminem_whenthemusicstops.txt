<i>[Bizarre:]</i><br/>
Music, reality<br/>
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference<br/>
But we as entertainers<br/>
Have a responsibility to these kids... Psych!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow<br/>
Would you feel sorrow, or show love? Or would it matter?<br/>
Could never be the lead-off batter<br/>
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'<br/>
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake<br/>
There's too much on my plate<br/>
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away<br/>
And not say what I got to say<br/>
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smoking crack?<br/>
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back<br/>
I'll get up 'fore I get down<br/>
Run myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out<br/>
I'm tryna smack this one out the park: five-thousand mark<br/>
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark<br/>
Ain't gon' do nothing but piss me off<br/>
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off<br/>
See me leap out, pull a piece out<br/>
Fuck shooting, I'm just tryna knock his teeth out<br/>
Fuck with me now, bitch; let's see you freestyle!<br/>
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap<br/>
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?<br/>
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that<br/>
Man, I hate this crap, this ain't rap<br/>
This is crazy, the way we act when we confuse hip-hop<br/>
With real life when the music stops<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swifty McVay:]</i><br/>
Ain't no getting rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried<br/>
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide<br/>
I have died clinically<br/>
Arrived back at my enemies' crib with Hennessy<br/>
Got drunk then I finished him<br/>
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy<br/>
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef<br/>
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently<br/>
I'm not what you think, I appear to be fucked up<br/>
Mentally endangered; I can't stay away from a razor<br/>
I just want my face in a paper<br/>
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight<br/>
To awake neighbours for acres<br/>
I'll murder you; I gauge and have me turn into a mad man<br/>
Son of Sam; bitch, I'm surgical<br/>
I'm allergic to dying â you think not?<br/>
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kon Artis:]</i><br/>
I was happy having a deal at first<br/>
Thought money would make me happy<br/>
But it only made my pain worse<br/>
It hurts when you see your friends<br/>
Turn their back on you, dawg<br/>
And you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls<br/>
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends<br/>
Begging with their hands out<br/>
Checking for your record when it's selling<br/>
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends<br/>
No girls, just the gin you drink till your car spin<br/>
You think "Damn!" when you slam into the wall<br/>
And you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm<br/>
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol<br/>
If my funeral's tomorrow<br/>
Wonder would they even call? When the music stops<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kuniva:]</i><br/>
Let's see how many of your men loyal<br/>
When I pull up looking for you with a pistol<br/>
Sipping a can of penzoil<br/>
I'm revved up; who said what? When lead bust<br/>
Your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed<br/>
Tossed in the paddy-wagon<br/>
Bragging about how you shouted like a coward<br/>
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas<br/>
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given the chance<br/>
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man<br/>
Death itself, it can't hurt me<br/>
Just the thought of dying alone that really irks me<br/>
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk<br/>
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark<br/>
Hug the floor while we playing tug-of-war with your life<br/>
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife<br/>
Deliver that shit that coroners like<br/>
You hype, popping shit in broad daylight<br/>
Nigga, you're a goner at night; when the music stops<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Proof:]</i><br/>
Instigators turn pits in cages<br/>
Let loose and bit the neighbors; wrist to razors<br/>
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk<br/>
In the dark, my dogs all bark, like, "Woof!"<br/>
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf<br/>
Get your whole roof caved in, like reindeer hoofs<br/>
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose<br/>
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves<br/>
It's Hill Street: this is hardcore Blues<br/>
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues<br/>
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move<br/>
When the Uzi pop, you better drop, when the music stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bizarre:]</i><br/>
Music has changed my life in so many ways<br/>
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade<br/>
LL told me to "Rock the Bells"<br/>
NWA said "Fuck the Police," now I'm in jail<br/>
Ninety-three was strictly R&amp;B<br/>
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci<br/>
Michael Jackson â who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?<br/>
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight<br/>
Flying down Sunset, smoking crack<br/>
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back<br/>
M.O.P. had me grimey and gritty<br/>
Marilyn Manson: I dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties<br/>
Ludacris told me to throw them bows<br/>
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose<br/>
And a fractured elbow<br/>
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock<br/>
I'm reaching for the Glock, but the music stops<br/>
<br/>

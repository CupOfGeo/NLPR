Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's "Freaky Tales" (Biatch!)<br/>
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking<br/>
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells<br/>
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she's decals<br/>
But when murdering females<br/>
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed<br/>
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail<br/>
If you get scratched because your DNA'll<br/>
Be all up under her fingernails<br/>
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares<br/>
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears<br/>
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware<br/>
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs<br/>
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare<br/>
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly<br/>
I said "I'm here to do sink repairs."<br/>
Chop her up, put her body parts<br/>
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there<br/>
<br/>
But hey man, I was framed<br/>
I know what this looks like, officers<br/>
Please just give me one minute<br/>
I think I can explain<br/>
I ain't murdered nobody<br/>
I know these words are so nutty<br/>
But I'm just here to entertain<br/>
How come your shirt is so bloody?<br/>
There's a missing person, so what? He's<br/>
Got nothin' to do with me<br/>
I'm almost certain I was framed<br/>
<br/>
Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong<br/>
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on<br/>
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard<br/>
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?<br/>
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it<br/>
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me<br/>
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde<br/>
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond<br/>
Second murder with no recollection of it<br/>
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it<br/>
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper<br/>
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender<br/>
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably<br/>
'Cause the disassembled body<br/>
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly<br/>
I'm wanted for questioning<br/>
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me<br/>
<br/>
But hey man, I was framed<br/>
I know what this looks like, officers<br/>
Please just give me one minute<br/>
I think I can explain<br/>
I ain't murdered nobody<br/>
I know these words are so nutty<br/>
But I'm just here to entertain<br/>
How come your shirt is so bloody?<br/>
There's a missing person, so what? He's<br/>
Got nothin' to do with me<br/>
I'm almost certain I was framed<br/>
<br/>
Still on the loose, they<br/>
Spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday<br/>
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate<br/>
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher<br/>
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase<br/>
Just escaped from the state pen<br/>
For <i>[edited]</i> eight women who hate men<br/>
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked<br/>
When I break in your basement<br/>
Under your baby's play pen, I lay in, wait adjacent<br/>
Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent<br/>
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown<br/>
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems<br/>
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home<br/>
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window<br/>
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene<br/>
In a verse and be charged with first degree<br/>
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly<br/>
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary<br/>
No, officer, you see...<br/>
<br/>
I was framed<br/>
I know what this looks like, officers<br/>
Please just give me one minute<br/>
I think I can explain<br/>
I ain't murdered nobody<br/>
I know these words are so nutty<br/>
But I'm just here to entertain<br/>
How come your shirt is so bloody?<br/>
There's a missing person, so what? He's<br/>
Got nothin' to do with me<br/>
I'm almost certain I was framed

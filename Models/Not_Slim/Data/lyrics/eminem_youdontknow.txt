This flow is gon' bring mo dough<br/>
And you know but you acting like you don't know<br/>
<br/>
Now homie I say I run it (run it) cause I'm in control<br/>
Hpnotic, Hennessey, a couple shots of Patron<br/>
I have you feeling aight, I get you high as a kite<br/>
Party popping shawty says she coming with me tonight<br/>
I ain't shoulder leaning, I ain't snapping and popping<br/>
Either I'm bobbin my head or I'm just standing there watching<br/>
I'm a hustler I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid<br/>
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade<br/>
Nigga you front you gon' get it, OK now maybe I said it<br/>
Cause I want you to triddy, yeah I be on that shitty<br/>
You should see when I'm stunting, I flash the stones to be wanting<br/>
Push the whip, see me rolling, you can tell that I'm holding<br/>
I'm just doing my thang, you know the Unit's the game<br/>
I got my grimy Shady with me you front you'll have to get me off your ass<br/>
I pay the lawsuit and laugh (haha)<br/>
It's not a big deal it's nothing but some cash (let's go)<br/>

<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
When me and Fif got together to do this music<br/>
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it<br/>
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis<br/>
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images<br/>
But this shit is new gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out<br/>
When there's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out<br/>
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it<br/>
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it<br/>
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit<br/>
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it<br/>
And let it go to whoever's holding the most current beef on their shoulders<br/>
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over<br/>
But tonight, we ain't coming here to beef with nobody<br/>
We came to party, Banks, Ca$his and Mr. Ferrari<br/>
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you wizzass<br/>
Come hizzon, what kinda fuzukin' quizition is that?<br/>

<i>[Ca$his]</i><br/>
Pistol play ricochet, see where the victim lay<br/>
Slumped over bleeding J.F.K<br/>
HK to your chest plate cave<br/>
I'mma ride to the death, do you rep that way?<br/>
Forever I'mma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta<br/>
Plus I survive everything you got in that chamber<br/>
I thrive off of danger, jumping in all beef<br/>
You keep talking shit now the squad called me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lloyd Banks]</i><br/>
Enough holding back the steam, Em let off a magazine<br/>
Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Ca$his creams<br/>
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see<br/>
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fucking G<br/>
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static<br/>
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walking bitch magnet<br/>
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit<br/>
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?<br/>

<i>[Tony Yayo]</i><br/>
You know who this is<br/>
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath<br/>
Lloyd Banks, Ca$his, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50<br/>
It's a movement, you can't stop it<br/>
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo

<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Yeah, shout to everybody<br/>
Who's been on this trip with me<br/>
You don't have to, agree<br/>
But if you feel like me<br/>
<br/>
Someone get this Aryan a sheet<br/>
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached<br/>
Everybody on your feet<br/>
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street<br/>
This chump barely even sleeps<br/>
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats<br/>
While he looks like a canary with a beak<br/>
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? He's tryin' to divide us<br/>
This shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us<br/>
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does<br/>
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause<br/>
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one<br/>
But here the jaws of life come<br/>
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from<br/>
When we can't wear stars and stripes 'cause<br/>
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal<br/>
But there's always tomorrow still<br/>
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal<br/>
And band together for Charlottesville<br/>
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals<br/>
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter<br/>
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal<br/>
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better<br/>
America, and here's to where it all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Alicia Keys &amp; Eminem:]</i><br/>
And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)<br/>
Here's to the land that made me<br/>
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)<br/>
Here's to the land that raised me<br/>
This one for the only place that really knows me<br/>
From the cracks in the road that drove me<br/>
There's no place like home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?<br/>
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya<br/>
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off<br/>
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ<br/>
And all you got are race cards, bigot<br/>
The swastika with your name carved in it<br/>
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off<br/>
And you just lick the plate off<br/>
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos<br/>
So basically, you ate off Hitler!<br/>
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk<br/>
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us<br/>
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up<br/>
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up<br/>
Against this train wreck and take a stand<br/>
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag<br/>
To sing "The Star-Spangled Banner"<br/>
This man just praised a statue of General Lee<br/>
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics<br/>
Take it back to the Shady national convention<br/>
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand<br/>
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal<br/>
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart<br/>
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for<br/>
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for<br/>
The start of a brand new America<br/>
Without him and be proud of where we're from<br/>
And here's to where we all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Alicia Keys &amp; Eminem:]</i><br/>
And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)<br/>
Here's to the land that made me<br/>
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)<br/>
Here's to the land that raised me<br/>
This one for the only place that really knows me<br/>
From the cracks in the road that drove me<br/>
There's no place like home<br/>
<br/>
I won't give up<br/>
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for<br/>
You already know that I won't give up<br/>
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for<br/>
You already know<br/>
There's no place like home, no place like home<br/>
Wherever I go, no place like home<br/>
No place like home, no place like home<br/>
Wherever I go (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)<br/>
Here's to the land that made me<br/>
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)<br/>
Here's to the land that raised me<br/>
This one for the only place that really knows me<br/>
From the cracks in the road that drove me<br/>
There's no place like home

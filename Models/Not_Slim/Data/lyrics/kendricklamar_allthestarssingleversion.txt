Love, let's talk about love<br/>
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?<br/>
Or do the feeling haunt you?<br/>
I know the feeling haunt you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SZA:]</i><br/>
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know<br/>
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br/>
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know<br/>
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Tell me what you gon' do to me<br/>
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me<br/>
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue<br/>
But you can't bring the truth to me<br/>
Fuck you and all your expectations<br/>
I don't even want your congratulations<br/>
I recognize your false confidence<br/>
And calculated promises all in your conversation<br/>
I hate people that feel entitled<br/>
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you<br/>
Oh, you important?<br/>
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?<br/>
Motherfucker, I don't even like you<br/>
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift<br/>
That's how you find out who you dealin' with<br/>
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with<br/>
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'<br/>
On my momma, that's the realest shit<br/>
<br/>
Love, let's talk about love<br/>
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?<br/>
Or do the feeling haunt you?<br/>
I know the feeling haunt you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SZA:]</i><br/>
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know<br/>
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br/>
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know<br/>
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br/>
<br/>
Skin covered with ego<br/>
Get to talkin' like a end-forth, like a rebound<br/>
No control, no off switch<br/>
In the way that you bringin' me down<br/>
It's a turn on, get it away from me<br/>
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me<br/>
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah<br/>
I just cry for no reason<br/>
I just pray for no reason<br/>
I just thank for the life, for the day<br/>
For the hours and another life breathin'<br/>
How did it all go to feel good?<br/>
You could live it all if you feel bad<br/>
Better live your life<br/>
We were runnin' out of time<br/>
<br/>
Love, let's talk about love<br/>
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Or do the feeling haunt you?<br/>
I know the feeling haunt you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SZA:]</i><br/>
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know<br/>
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br/>
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know<br/>
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Hah, what, how real is this?<br/>
Uh, uh, how real is this?<br/>
What? Uh, what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
We push the hottest Vs, peel fast<br/>
Through the city, play Monopoly with real cash<br/>
Me and Biggie and the models be shaking they sadiddy ass<br/>
And Prada be, something you cats got to see<br/>
<br/>
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones<br/>
Being broke is childish and I'm quite grown<br/>
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan<br/>
Scope the spot out, see something nice and I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
You cats is home, screaming the fight's on<br/>
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watching Tyson<br/>
Same night, same fight<br/>
But one of us cats ain't playing right<br/>
I let you tell it<br/>
<br/>
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons<br/>
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get<br/>
And any chance you hit, we live for the moment<br/>
Makes sense don't it?<br/>
<br/>
Now make dollars<br/>
Cats pop bottles<br/>
Bone chicks that favor Idalis<br/>
And rack up frequent flier mileage<br/>

Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey<br/>
I love the dough, more than you know<br/>
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey<br/>

<i>[Notorious B.I.G.:]</i><br/>
I'm popping Magnums while Jigga bag something<br/>
Watch is platinum, got jet-lag from<br/>
Flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes<br/>
Make the best CDs and the best tapes<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget the vinyl<br/>
Take girls break spinals<br/>
Biggie be Richie like Lionel<br/>
Shit<br/>
You seen the JesÃºs, dipped to H classes<br/>
Ice project off lights, chick flashes<br/>
<br/>
Blind your broke asses<br/>
Even got rocks in the beards and mustaches<br/>
Rock top fashions<br/>
Ain't shit changed<br/>
Except the number after the dot<br/>
On the Range<br/>
Way niggas look at me now, kinda strange<br/>
I hate y'all too<br/>
Rather be in Caribbean sands with Rachel<br/>
It's unreal<br/>
Out the blue Frank White got sex appeal<br/>
Bitches used to go, "Ewww!"<br/>
<br/>
Still tote steel<br/>
I'm trying to see five mil<br/>
Off the single, for real<br/>
You ain't fazing the amazing<br/>
While your gun's raising, mine is blazing<br/>
<br/>
See you on see me all talking to sweetness<br/>
Take it for weakness and leave quick<br/>
Blocker, Roc-A-Fella, Bad Boy collabo<br/>
Two MCs with mad dough, you know!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Angela Winbush:]</i><br/>
I love the dough more than you know<br/>
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey<br/>
(I love the dough)<br/>
I love the dough more than you know<br/>
(gonna let it show)<br/>
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z, Notorious B.I.G.:]</i><br/>
Miraculous, pockets stay full<br/>
Niggas skip the bull 'cause we matadors<br/>
Snatch the P89s that we pack in the drawers<br/>
And we clap the doors of your Acuras<br/>
<br/>
Snap like cameras on amateurs<br/>
Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours<br/>
Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws<br/>
Everybody got a part to play, back to yours<br/>
<br/>
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors<br/>
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss<br/>
Play the charts like The Beatles, y'all adapt to loss<br/>
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all<br/>
<br/>
Too bad for y'all, ain't too many as bad as yours<br/>
Truly, do we, we laugh at y'all<br/>
Little bastards y'all<br/>
Uh, uh<br/>
<br/>
We hit makers with acres<br/>
Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us<br/>
Lost chips on Lakers, gassed-off Shaq<br/>
Country house, tennis courts on horseback<br/>
<br/>
Riding deciding cracked crab or lobster<br/>
Who say mobsters don't prosper?<br/>
Niggas is actors, niggas deserve Oscars<br/>
<br/>
Me. I'm critically acclaimed<br/>
Slug past your brain<br/>
Reminisce on dames who coochie used to stink<br/>
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links<br/>
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places<br/>
Tito smile every time he see our faces<br/>
<br/>
Cases catch more than outfielders<br/>
Half these rapping cats ain't seen war<br/>
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame<br/>
Speak my name, I make 'em dash like Dame<br/>
<br/>

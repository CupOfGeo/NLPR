Meet Eddie, twenty-three-years-old<br/>
Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store<br/>
("I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes")<br/>
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart<br/>
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play<br/>
("Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Alright, stop! (Huh?)<br/>
Now before you walk in the door<br/>
Of this liquor store<br/>
And try to get money out the drawer<br/>
You better think of the consequence<br/>
(But who are you?)<br/>
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
That's nonsense!<br/>
Go in, gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs<br/>
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs<br/>
Tell her you need a place to stay<br/>
You'll be safe for days<br/>
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to<br/>
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you<br/>
Think about it before you walk in the door first<br/>
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Fuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch!<br/>
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?<br/>
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?<br/>
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre (Eminem)]</i><br/>
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it!<br/>
(You're right!)<br/>
Not over this shit (Stop!) Drop the biscuit (I will!)<br/>
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you<br/>
(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude)<br/>
<br/>
("It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute")<br/>
("Mmm, I don't know!")<br/>
("Look baby")<br/>
("Damn!")<br/>
("Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?")<br/>
("Well OK.")<br/>
<br/>
Meet Stan, twenty-one-years-old<br/>
("Give me a kiss!")<br/>
After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom<br/>
Once again, his conscience comes into play<br/>
("Shit!")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem (Dr. Dre)]</i><br/>
Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek<br/>
And smearing her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink<br/>
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe<br/>
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old<br/>
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)<br/>
Yo, look at her bush. Does it got hair? (Uh huh!)<br/>
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare<br/>
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there<br/>
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?)<br/>
No, but I seen the porno with Son Doobiest!<br/>
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)<br/>
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail<br/>
<br/>
Here I lay<br/>
(Damn it feels good to be home)<br/>
<br/>
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine-year-old construction worker<br/>
After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man<br/>
("What the fuck?!")<br/>
("Grady!")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre (Eminem)]</i><br/>
Alright calm down, relax, start breathing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'<br/>
While you at work she's with some dude trying to get off?!<br/>
Fuck slitting her throat, cut this bitch's head off!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Wait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?<br/>
(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?!)<br/>
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady<br/>
But think about the baby before you get all crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem (Dr. Dre)]</i><br/>
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?<br/>
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?<br/>
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard<br/>
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?!<br/>
(What you say?)<br/>
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?<br/>
(I'mma kill you motherfucker!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Uh-ha! Temper temper!<br/>
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?<br/>
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?<br/>
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went<br/>
Been there, done that. Aw fuck it<br/>
What am I saying? Shoot em both Grady, where's your gun at?

me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
hit the house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish
home invasion was persuasive
from nine to five i know it's vacant, ya bish

dreams of living life like rappers do
back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
i fucked sherane and went to tell my bros
then usher raymond "let it burn" came on

hot sauce all in our top ramen, ya bish
park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish
the only thing we had to free our mind
then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs

you looking like a easy come-up, ya bish
a silver spoon i know you come from, ya bish
and that's a lifestyle that we never knew
go at a reverend for the revenue

it go halle berry or hallelujah
pick your poison tell me what you do
everybody gon' respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
(the one in front of the gun, forever)

and i been hustlin' all day,
this a way, that a way
through canals and alleyways, just to say
money trees is the perfect place for shade
and that's just how i feel, nah, nah

a dollar might just fuck your main bitch
that's just how i feel, nah
a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
that's just how i feel, nah, nah
a dollar might just make that lane switch
that's just how i feel, nah
a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
that's just how i feel


dreams of living life like rappers do
bump that new e-forty at the school
(we at the school)
you know, big ballin' with my homies
earl stevens had us thinking rational

back to reality we poor, ya bish
another casualty at war, ya bish
two bullets in my uncle tony head
he said one day i'd be on tour, ya bish

that louies burger never be the same
(won't be the same)
a louis belt will never ease that pain
but i'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
pull off at church's with pirellis skirtin'

gang signs out the window, ya bish
hoping all of 'em offend you, ya bish
they say your hood is a pot of gold
and we gon' crash it when nobody's home

it go halle berry or hallelujah
pick your poison tell me what you do
everybody gon' respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
(the one in front of the gun, forever)

and i been hustlin' all day,
this a way, that a way
through canals and alleyways, just to say
money trees is the perfect place for shade
and that's just how i feel, nah, nah
a dollar might just fuck your main bitch
that's just how i feel, nah
a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
that's just how i feel, nah, nah
a dollar might just make that lane switch
that's just how i feel, nah
a dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how i feel


be the last one out to get this dough? no way
love one of you bucket-headed hoes? no way
hit the streets, then we break the code? no way
hit the brakes, when they on patrol? no way


imagine rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
santa claus don't miss them stockings,
liquor spilling pistols popping
baking soda yola whipping,
ain't no turkey on thanksgiving
my homeboy just domed a nigga,
i just hope the lord forgive him

pots with cocaine residue,
every day i'm hustling
what else is a thug to do
when you eat cheese from the government
gotta provide for my daughter n'em,
get the fuck up out my way, bitch
got that drum and i got them bands
just like a parade, bitch

drop that work up in the bushes,
hope them boys don't see my stash
if they do tell the truth,
this the last time you might see my ass

from the gardens where the grass ain't cut,
them serpents lurking blood
bitches selling pussy, niggas
selling drugs but it's all good

broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
take your js and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is

in the streets with a heater under my dungarees
dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

it go halle berry or hallelujah
pick your poison tell me what you do
everybody gon' respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
(the one in front of the gun, forever)

and i been hustlin' all day,
this a way, that a way
through canals and alleyways, just to say
money trees is the perfect place for shade
and that's just how i feel

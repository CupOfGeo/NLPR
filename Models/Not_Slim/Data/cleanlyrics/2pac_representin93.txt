"i got a head, but ain't no screws in it"

roll up and get swoll up, hold up
how ya gonna play me like a sunkin dunkin donut?
i ain't came a long way to get checked
so give me respect when i get wreck
or get your motherfuckin chin checked

hoping i can rock the shit to get ya open
say your looking for some real shit
then catch a funkified batch

oakland's on the map
twopac is on the big screen strivin
gotta love a nigga for survivin
i wear alot of old schools jewels

stop lookin at me hard cause you're buffer
but i'll just buck them bigger motherfuckers
turnin men to suckers
niggas wanna start a little ruckus
better duck cause i'll be poppin' them motherfuckers
they wanna throw their hands up, that's tight
hit em wit my eight, never had shit left, right
then hit em wit the uppercut, duck quick
shit outta luck, fucked and stuck with that rough shit

glock cocked the day they kill me

just a couple of motherfuckers that i know
i'm strictly representin 

one motherfucker, two motherfucker, three motherfuckers
damn, who did i forget? 

i'm a soulja, daddy was a soulja
strong in the struggle
must contend so it's on
raised in a house full of bad motherfuckers
mad motherfuckers
never had so we grab from the stacked motherfuckers
now they know me, the homies
raised by some crazed ass well payed og's
ah shit!
pulled up in a benzy, snatch
the wheel as i peel out. catch a cop's tail
rock shells hit. raise a fist so they know to make a hit
can i flip it? i may get wicked as i rip it
to get specific: if the shoe fits, then kick it
it's for the gifted, pump your fist if you wit it
here's your ticket to see mr. wicked rip shit
now they wanna ban me (told ya)
all i wanted to be was a soulja
bang bang boogie, it's a stick up
quit now, nigga, eat a dick up
huh, i'm representin'

we tradin' war stories, we outlawz on the rise
jealous niggas i despise, look in my eyes
we tradin' war stories, we outlawz on the rise
jealous niggas i despise, look in my eyes


now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin' hard liquor
this ghetto life has got me catchin' up to god quicker
who would figure that all i need was a hair trigger
semi-automatic mac-eleven just to scare niggas
pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday 
and feared men grow on trees
criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
so niggas whisper when they mention
machiavelli was my tutor donald goines, my father figure
mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
henceforth, we thug niggas and we came in packs
every one of niggas strapped sippin' on yak
in the back, my ar-fifteen
thuggin' 'til i die, these streets got me cravin' thorazine
my lyrics are blueprints to money makin'
fat as that ass that honey shakin'


my nigga tradin' war stories, we outlawz on the rise
jealous niggas i despise, look in my eyes
my nigga tradin' war stories, we outlawz on the rise

i bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
they call it overthuggin' and shit
but i was just a younger nigga;
gettin' older and lovin' this shit
but what was i doin' in this place?
to the fakes without a pistol in the first
facin' termination in the worst
but i figured to play the wall; to watch all
these playa hatin' niggas position for i could see 'em all
made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
but it'll never be a repeat people i'm tryna tell you


now picture the scenery, i'm thugged out smokin' greenery
considered a b.g., but i'm off in this game something d-p
my eyes only see deez, that's why i'm young and burnt out
learned the know how, well how to do now, by eighteen turned out
and wide open - the ridin' and smokin'
collidin' with foes - in the worst place;
y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us ,in the first place
y'all real o.g.'s, droppin' game to the youngsters
y'all don't want no funk cause
y'all be the next in the long line of war stories


we tradin' war stories, we outlawz on the rise

i breaks them off with this gangsta war story tale
stacking loot up in the coupe that i protect with a mack twelve
slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
no one will remain when i come through dumping insane
call me bo loc major pain, gun-slang and moving 'caine
i be the nigga that's pulling the trigger and dumping the hot ones up in your brain
more bigger balls than rupaul, thug life ain't a ball
we bust that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
never been no sign for men call
how we bucks them down on the way to the ground
ain't nothing but the hog in me
plus, stompin' steel toed, killin' up hoes and keep mobbin' g
it ain't no calling the funk off
don't be funking with my sawed off
bust they dirty-ass drawers off
and had them bitch niggas hauled off


we tradin' war stories, we outlawz on the rise

my whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
ain't nothing on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
i'm reminiscing, and catchin' flashbacks when niggas ran up
in my house and i was too young, to try to blast back
what happened then? no one would tell me since i was three
heard that god took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
but fuck that, you got whats mines and i want that
never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
and now i'm sitting, holding in anger because my parents missing
thugging immortal when got some war stories for you


now look at me - straight outlaw immortal
never gave a fuck cause i was nobody's daughter
outlawing from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure
cause the murderous tendencies in my mind, can't be controlled, nigga
so who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
would you try to trip with my finger on the nine milla
when i got you on kay-nine-fourths
prayin' to god as your life goes back and forth

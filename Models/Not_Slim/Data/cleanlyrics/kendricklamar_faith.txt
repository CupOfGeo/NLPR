cloud nine, kendrick lamar, uh
i take a sip of hennessy and then get pissy drunk
i ain't a drinker, i'm a thinker, call it what you want
but if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
i found myself losing focus at a sunday service
embarrassed so i started questioning god, what is my purpose?
he say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
spread the word and witness, he rose on the first sunday
i said alright, enthused that my lord gave a listen
i opened my bible and searched to be a better christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
but shit, my life is so fucked up man, i can't help but give in
i'm giving testimonies to strangers i never met
hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how i was truly blessed
felt like i'm free from all my sins when the service was over
walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again


what am i gonna do? gotta have faith
life is too much, understood? where is your faith?
oh, faaaaaaaith...
all you need is the size of a mustard seed


single black parent from compton raising children of four
that's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know
her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
her baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit
spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
she pray to god every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
she thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the devil is a lie, make a better choice
and so it's back to mcdonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
then got a letter in the mail, lost her section eight
then lost her faith again




kendrick, i appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
this about how faith works, yeah, murk it... 
i had dreams of holding a nine-milla to raise killa
ask him why as my eyes fill up
each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
it's jungle when the niggas ensue
the rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents
cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
i flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
it's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
it's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
i'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout
but it never rain in california 'less them pistols out
until then, my feet planted on the ground
shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
and if i get no answer, just know i tried
i should have never looked into his son's eyes
ray charles voice




this for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a god?
knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
but whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains
we can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
and your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares
searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
i watched people i know pray and catch the holy ghost
and wonder why i ain't never caught that feeling before
maybe they know him better, or i don't know no better
but what i do know is that he's real and he lives forever
so the next time you feel like your world's about to end
i hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

i'd rather not live like there isn't a god
than die and find out there really is, think about it

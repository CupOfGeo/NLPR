no man separate what we create
unstoppable, untouchable
motherfuckin' worldwide mob figures
death row at it's finest!
m.o.b., thug for motherfuckin' life
motherfuckin' made niggas
we comin' after these niggas, worldwide
feel me! makaveli the don

my life in exchange for yours, born hated as a thug
house full of babies cryin' from a lack of gettin' love
ain't nobody tell me shit, 'til i got a sack of drugs
had the block sewn up, cause i learned to pack a gun
do you feel me? world, do you hear me?
catch a risin' star, fuck the love, niggas fear me
got these niggas runnin' all wild from my double-r
when we ride, motherfuckers is sure to die
boom once i enter the room, in the air
all you hear is the whispers of doom, niggas scared
they don't wanna see me head on
think of all the busters that i had to leave dead and gone
call a gravedigga, fuckin' with a made nigga
m.o.b, gunfire, gettin' sprayed quicker
fuck 'em all, let 'em understand my plot to get richer
much more than six figures, a motherfuckin' made nigga

(can you feel me?)
a motherfuckin' made nigga
i got a plot to get richer
take my picture, a made nigga


nigga, i was raised on the streets, i had to hustle just to eat
my role model was killin' niggas, so i know i would never be weak
they got me sittin' wonderin', where my life begins
these niggas crossed my father, then my father crossed them
'cause i roll with immortal thug niggas
and my number one plan to kill a man
to grab a needle and drug niggas
niggas don't like us, because they bitches straight love us
the president told us to leave
'cause the government don't want us
it's napoleon, i get my pleasure out of sin
and seein' blood spill ain't shit 'cause i seen it at the beginnin'
a made nigga


how many niggas fall in your vision?
gunnin' 'em down for every last minute that i spent in prison
we mash together, plus we get cash together
blast whenever, knowin' it don't last forever
it's only one way out and one way in
motherfuckers cross and get crossed out, never made men
we find excuses to loot, cock, and shoot
blow the roof off them groups like rauf al-mabhouh
i can't be touched, 'cause of the weapons i clutch
and the niggas that i'm under is just too much: we made niggas


picture the scenery, 'cause for now you gon' have to imagine
call me your prophet 'cause i predicted what's gon' happen
i began the paper, stackin' at those who be paper snatchin'
will emerge like crack in the eighty's
fade me? maybe, that's if i slip
but i became official since the start of this
edi amin, born july, seventh, a few shed eyes, precious
but others gave me they hate to cherish
but still i made it, a made nigga made by the game
made for war, my aim is simple and plain
yeah, whether it's 'caine, or these tracks made for your brain
you'll forever know my name, edi, a made nigga


i ain't count the line, my strap, my head
there will be none of that
the young hog, k-dog playin' outlaw immortal combat
with the criminal skill, they cannot beat me a nigga
'til he still and chill, recognize the real deal
feel  a nigga made when i was young and dumb
with a gun, but it pays, so i'm bustin' for fun
and the outcome will be the same every time
we all gon' die, get yours 'cause i'ma get mine


tha outlawz, we be the don juan's of this rough shit
rhymes baptize your mind while paralyze the public
with my mentality of war
dead bodies and silence, give it to you raw
thug nigga to the core
the results of livin' poor, got me thinkin' on a made level
shootin' my gauge to get paid, a fuckin' crazed devil
mash shit from here to here, day by day, year to year
made niggas on your motherfuckin' tear: i'm a made nigga


call me a bad boy killer, murder motherfuckers daily
know the feds trail me, so my alias makaveli
gettin' lessons from niggas in penitentiaries
game, when applied, help me survive several centuries
lock me in a cage, i'll display my rage
surround the court buildin' with the gauge and spray
they wonder if i'll go when i'm finally sentenced
on my knees to god, beggin' for repentance
i'm so convinced that i'm a thug
they got me fiendin' for my cash
like a fiend when he dreams of drugs
diss the dada and i'll kidnap your daughter
kill your wife and hit the funeral
and tell you just who gave the order
makaveli the don 'til i'm gone
i maintain my army of lunatics that stay armed
'til the day i die, i'll be remembered as a paid nigga
outlaw to the grave, a motherfuckin' made nigga

can you feel me? come closer, ha ha ha
get into the mind of a made nigga, i can't be touched
my adversaries get fucked, feel me?
multimillionaire dreams
all i want is the c.r.e.a.m.
i sell my shit to the fiends, all the bitches scream
come and see, to see a made nigga
outlawz, makaveli the don
hussein fatal, edi amin, kastro
napoleon, kadafi, mussolini, m.o.b.
i send this out to my niggas on the streets
the motherfuckin' made niggas
all my niggas on death row, tha dogg pound
tha doggfather, and all his niggas
you know what time it is
daz dillinger, kurupt, young gotti
(hahaha, westside made niggas, beyotch!!!)

we've got uhh twopac shakur
uhh fatal, fatal hussein uhh kastro, kadafi

uhh, i repeat, let 'em go
i repeat, let 'em go
they're made niggas let 'em go
but, but sarge, they've got guns, they've got weed

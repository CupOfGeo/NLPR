see i told ya'll
i told ya'll motherfuckers
i told ya'll to stop
i prayed for you to stop
but you didn't stop
and then we won't stop

time, time for you to die
as i kiss your ass goodnight
time, time for you to die
as i kiss your ass goodnight

i make your mouthpiece obese like della reese
when i release, you lose teeth like lil' cease
nigga please
blood floods your dungarees
and that's just a half of my warpath
laugh now cry later, i rhyme greater
than the average player hater, and spectators
buy my cd twice
they see me in the streets they be like you he nice
but that's on the low though
be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
i pull out four-fours, and go up in they clothes
short-change niggas
snort-caine niggas
extortion came quicker
bought the range nigga
you still tickle me
i used to be as strong as ripple be 'til lil' cease crippled me
now i play hard-like my girl's nipples be
the game sour like a pickle be
you all know the rules
move from bk to new jeruz
thinking 'bout, all the planes we flew
bitches, we ran through
now the year's new
i lay my game flat
i want my spot back, take two
motherfuckers mad 'cause i blew, niggas envious
too many niggas on my dick, shit's strenuous
when my men bust, you just move with such stamina
slugs missed you
i ain't mad at you (we ain't mad at you)
blood rushing, concussions, ain't nothing
catch cases, come out fronting
smoking something
sipping white russians, bitch in the benz bumping
i laced it with the basic
six tvs, a system, knocking mase shit, face it
we hard to hit
guard your shit, 'fore i stick you, for your re-up
wipe the pee up
lick shots, woke your seed up
go in the ashtray, spark the weed up
long kiss

time, time for you to die
as i kiss your ass goodnight
time, time for you to die
as i kiss your ass goodnight

hell, we don't give a fuck
we just absolutely don't give a fuck because
there ain't no love here
there ain't no love here
you know, we gon' keep doing what we do
we gon' keep fucking you up
i'll be stomping your motherfucking head in, you fucking bitch

i flaming gats, aiming at, these fucking
maniacs put my name in raps
what part the game is that?
like they hustle backwards
i smoke backwoods, and dutchies
ya can't touch me
try to rush me
slugs go, touchy-touchy
you're bleeding lovely, with you, spirit above me
or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me
rest where the worms and the weak be
my nine flies, baptize, rap guys
with the holy ghost
i put holes in most, you hold your toast shaky
slipping trying to break me
look what you made me do, brains blew
my team in the marine-blue, six coupe
skied it out, weeded out, cleaning out
the block for distances, giving long kisses bitch

time, time for you to die
as i kiss your ass goodnight
time, time for you to die
as i kiss your ass goodnight

only understand, i say a prayer for you
you know, that's the only thing i can do, just pray for your mind
because, see, your mind is in control of your heart
where its supposed to be the other way around
your heart has got to control your mind
so now, i have no feelings for you
you have made me cold

frank white the menacing, chron chron's the medicine
i got the lettuce and
you turn green like cucumber skin got the new hummer in the summer when i was a new comer
then drugs and mac-tens
hug from fake friends
make ends they hate you, be broke girls won't date you
that's why i relate to, choke your ass 'til your face blue, make you
open the safe too
no matter how you call it (how you call it)
this brolic, alcoholic
like his weed green'd out like his brick solid
distribute to kids who, take heart like valentine, drink ballantine, all the time
slugs hit your chest tap your spine
flat line
heard through the grapevine, you got fucked foe times
damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real though
sling steel slow
as you remorse we feel no

time, time for you to die
as i kiss your ass goodnight
time, time for you to die
as i kiss your ass goodnight

see the fucked up thing is that i love you
you know what i'm saying
it's just in my nature to love you
i can't hate you
'cause its not in my nature to hate you
you know, i don't know
maybe i'm a different type of individual
but you have me on a line
and there's a thin line between love and hate
and god-forbid i cross that line
'cause i'm not gon' give a fuck
i'm telling you right motherfucking now
the shit that ya'll done started
is never gonna stop!
we are never gonna stop!
and we're not talking about no other rappers
we're talking about you, motherfucker!
you know who i'm talking to
we coming for you
we coming for you
laughs
feels so good
i'mma make you love me baby, baby

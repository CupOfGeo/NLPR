conversate, sex on the first date i state "you know what you do to me"
she starts off, "well i don't usually"
then i, whip it out, rubber no doubt
step out, show me what you all about
fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
pull your g-string down south, aoowww

by a cherokee and a green drop-top
and i don't stop, until i squirt

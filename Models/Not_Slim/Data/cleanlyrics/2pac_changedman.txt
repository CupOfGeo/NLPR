shit, i'm a changed man
ay, turn the lights out
big baller twopac up in this bitch
y'know how we swing this shit, look


by age sixteen i sold to dopefiends
not yet a drug dealer, but i watched 'em closely
until they noticed me
i got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
far too inhibited for gun smoke, i broke his jaw
words harder than a fuckin' diamond
mobile phone call to simon
niggas trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
fuck them slowly like jodeci
and stick a needle in my eye if i don't live and die for m.o.b
and fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
i hit your block and we can box for fun
nigga one on one, last to fall is a ballin' cat
it's death row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
so if you knew me in my past life
don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
i switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
the game plan of a changed man, so what i'm sayin' is


i changed plans but i'm still the same old rider
(fuckin' with a changed man)
i slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)
all my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
you go and drink the henn' up
(you fuckin' with a changed man)
a changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man


in drop top, the glock cocked
got rocks in my socks cops
spot watt niggas but hardly stop niggas
not if they got niggas, dough boys and hot niggas
who mighta shot niggas but only by skrilla
i'm for respect nowadays they expect me
to be in a ferrari or the old sl
or anything you see flashing past and can't catch
dat's me, gauge on the escalate back seat - don't creep
oh what you think, t.i.p. and them sweet? (don't sleep)
get you hit from your head to your feet (and you don't know me)
i'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
you walk in, exploded and leave reload
you don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
but you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece g
no three niggas here are gonna let me be
or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga


i changed plans but i'm still the same old rider
(you fuckin' with a changed man)
i slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)
all my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
you go and drink the henn' up
(you fuckin' with a changed man)
a changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
you fuckin' with a changed man


a nigga so cold when i flow, bow down to death row
three wheel motion, comin' through coastin'
who's that nigga in the g-ride
screamin' out m.o.b.! nigga we ride
i hit the charts like a stick-up kid
number one in the nation
i fucked the world, the judge gave me probation
faced with incarceration
move tapes like it's big weight, slangin' to the whole nation
gimme mine, or i'm blastin' on every song
murder my enemies, i'm mashin' until i'm gone
one love to my thug niggas
and fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggas
throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
never come against the mass of smoke, on death row
my adversaries bleed
but fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease
fuckin' with a changed man


i changed plans but i'm still the same old rider

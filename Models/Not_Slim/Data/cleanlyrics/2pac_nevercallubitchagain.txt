whassup, boo? swear i'll never call you bitch again
you ain't fuck with me
i swear i'll never call you bitch again
(all i just wanna say is um, if i fuckin' apologized)
i swear i'll never call you bitch again
(i ain't mean to call you a bitch)
i'll never call you bitch again


damn  gave my homie ninety days for domestic violence
i try to picture myself in this position but remain silent
i get to thinkin' 'bout this shit we been through
we close like kin, but you remain my friend too
this life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble
but you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why i love you
reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues
swear i can't live with you
but without you, every day i miss you
when we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-itch, you
always in the mood for love, that's why i'm sleepin' with you
though not the man of your dreams
my plan and scheme's to be rich like a king
and live my life trouble free, i see
yesterday i called you names and played games on your mind
i promise that i'll change in time
it's a complicated world so, girl, just be a friend
i swear i'll never call you bitch again (and that's my word)


we came too far to throw it all away
(i swear i'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
we came way too far, pretty baby
to throw it all away, throw it all away
(i swear i'll never call you bitch again, hey)


i wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
nigga still tired so i'm yawnin', and now i'm gone
tryin' to get my money on strong
so an early riser out before them other guys
that's the way to profit every time
can't get too close my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
plus we been beefin' with the east coast, with casualties
got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
but while i'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
my enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
you paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
i promise not to leave you on your own again
cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
it's so frantic but don't panic, 'cause we crossed the top
i found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
i swear i'll never call you bitch again, believe me


we came too far to throw it all away
(i swear i'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
we came way too far, pretty baby
to throw it all away, throw it all away
(i swear i'll never call you bitch again, believe me)


i know, i know, all that is dead though
i'm changed, i'm tellin' you
i know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time
to grow up, ya know what i'm sayin'?
that was way back then


you're my nigga, my best friend
never gonna call you a bitch again
yea yea yea, oh


witness the evil men do, all this shit i been through
never meant to hurt you, can we make this work, boo?
i know you been feelin' pain, things are not the same
waitin' to exhale while i'm sittin' in the county jail
keep your head up, 'cause things are gettin' better
my cellmate shed tears off your last love letter
told him you would find a friend, so keep your eyes peeled
sorry if i cuss, but it's the sufferin' that i feel
who can i trust? and if i bust, will she snitch?
even though you ain't the type to trip, sorry if i called you bitch
you showed me the definition of feminine
the difference between a pack of bitches and black women
huh, i see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon
pictures of us kissin' in the livin' room, in the nude
thanks for being there much more than a friend
i swear i'll never call you bitch again; believe me!


we came too far, to throw it all away
we came way too far, pretty baby
(i swear i'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
we came too far to throw it all away
(i swear i'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
we came way too far, pretty baby
to throw it all away, throw it all away baby


through all my ups and downs
you always stayed around stayed around

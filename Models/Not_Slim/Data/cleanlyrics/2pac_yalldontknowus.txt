yo, i can see, that you obviously, don't know me
or my homies we o-u-t lawz, fuck the phonies
a wise hustler once told me
"it's on you", though in his dreams when he first told me
now it's true, i got love for you
only to a certain extinct, niggas ain't worth shit
cops and ride dick permits
i heard this and heard that about them o-u-t lawz
some of them soldiers got shot, some of them soldiers fell off
fuck y'all now everybody tied to us
hollerin' out a nigga name, but never said what up
that shit critical, despicable, unforgivable
 like i blew yo' own, fan won't remember you
thuggin' but we still spiritual, clear lyrical
i'm like the fuckin' deff squad, my ears ain't hearin' y'all
pump fearin' y'all, but damn i ain't even wantin' to scare y'all
listen to what i tell y'all, fuck the world
your baby moms, and your baby girl
you muthafuckas so fake, yo they made me wanna earl
blake, hate snakes thug hatin' the degree
outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
thug niggas


we, will never, fall
through it all, we'll always stand tall
cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
and if you believe in that shit that you heard
y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us


now i've been trapped down, and fucked from day one
this indestructible style of mine, ain't no fun
where i'm from, you sure to see about ten niggas in a bedroom
eatin' off the same spoon, sweepin' with the same broom
it's hazard, if you don't want yo life, well give me grab it
i was born inside a love zone, with a glock-nine young marriage
it's critical
then one of them sat down livin' so mystical
and influenced with a heart full of anger it's so ridiculous
so give me some with twenty-one-gun soldier salute
with a nineteen-inch black handle snake knife in my boots
straight from the strong, thug to your life
right into yo' wrong, i'll put the good to yo' evil
i'm the shells to your chrome, you dig that?
i'm life, i'll bring the moon to your night
i'll put the dick to your wife
and i'm the jesuz of your christ
you dig that? respect this
i'll bring the end to your claw
i'll bring the loc to your heart, and i'll put the snoop on yo dogs
you hear me? 
we follow, this little bullet so hollow
i can promise that ecstasy ain't promised tomorrow
with this two man mades, me and my soul death astrayed
i watch my parents get blowed away
now look what it made
i'm something to face
this ludacy then with me, then with chemistry
got my eyes on you, the first time you cross me
i'll be fryin' you, cause y'all don't know me


we will never fall
through it all, we'll always stand tall (why)
cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers


when we was kids, the lovin' felt good
but of course have the respect, though it's even better
now for this chedder, niggas is layin' deader
then malcom and martin, put together
oh lord only knows, where we'll end up
remember
'pac said: watch the fuckin' signs
but we wasn't listenin', too busy tripping off his shine
now one time for my muthafuckin' outlawz
napoleon, noble, and kastro, may we all roll
and if you don't know, we got the rap game petro
scared cause we 'bout to release, like heavy metal
nationwide, underground, we runnin' the ghettos
stealin' all of ya fan base, like we kleptos
bitch i can't let go
i been strugglin' too long, thuggin' too long
and niggas is stealin' my shit, and bustin' it wrong
hot shots holla back, when you get 'em
outlawz'll sic 'em, bustin' back at the system
military wisdom, preparin' myself for armageddon
breakin' my balls at this game, knowin' it's a dead end
and my only weapon is my believe that i'm superior
yeah, we the muthafuckas you niggas is liery off
controlling my steam, knowin' my team, to serve more
fuck the reframe, stick to the game and earn more
holdin' my head, rollin' the head with focus
laughin' inside, cause deep inside, y'all don't know us


we will never fall
through it all, we'll always stand tall (why)
cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
and if you believe in that shit that you heard
y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us
we will never fall (never)
through it all, we'll always stand tall
cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
and if you believe in that shit that you heard
y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us


ain't never know niggas like us boy
they don't make niggas like us no more
thug in peace... to all my niggas (never)
see ya soon... uh

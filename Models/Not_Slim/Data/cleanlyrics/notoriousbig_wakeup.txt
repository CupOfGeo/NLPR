what you expected from his next of kin
i'm loco bro, but ain't no mexican
i got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen
a shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while i'm shittin
the lesson from the smith and wessun is depressin
niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
how many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
and my body start to shake, if i should die before i wake


i'm here, i'm watching you (if i should die before i wake)
love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through (if i should die before i wake)
this, can be, reality (if i should die before i wake)
wake, up, my dead face i see (if i should die before i wake)
my dead face i see, my dead face i see!!




on your mark, get set, when i spark you're wet
look how dark it get when you're marked wit death
should i, start your breath or should i let you die
if he start to cry, ask why?
lyrically, i'm worshipped, don't front, the word's sick
you cursed it, but rehearsed it
i drop unexpectedly like bird shit
you herbs get, stomped quickly for raw t's and show money
don't forget the publishin, i'm punishin
i'm done wit them, son i'm surprised you run wit them
i think they got cumin, cause they nothin but bitch
tryna blow up like nitro wit dynamite sticks
mad i smoke, but yo i rock diamonds that's sick
got paper off my flow, ride wit my own click
take chicks to cairo, layin wit yo' bitch
i know you playin you was rich
fuck you prick, when i see you i'ma..


i am here, i'm watching you (when i see you i'ma..)
love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through (when i see you i'ma..)
this, can be, reality (when i see you i'ma..)
wake, up, my dead face i see (when i see you i'ma..)
my dead face i see (when i see you i'ma..), my dead face i see!!




when i see you i'ma.. when i see you i'ma..

california love
california knows how to party
california knows how to party
in the city of l.a
in the city of good ol' watts
in the city, the city of compton
we keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'


now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
a state that's untouchable like eliot ness
the track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex
we in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
the state where you never find a dance floor empty
and pimps be on a mission for them greens
lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
i been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
ever since honeys was wearing sassoon
now it's 'ninety-five and they clock me and watch me
diamonds shining, looking like i robbed liberace
it's all good, from diego to the bay
your city is the bomb if your city making pay
throw up a finger if you feel the same way
dre putting it down for californ-i-a


california knows how to party
california knows how to party (yes, they do)
in the city of l.a
in the city of good ol' watts
in the city, the city of compton
we keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'


shake, shake it, baby
shake, shake it, mama
shake it cali, shake it shake it baby
shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it


out on bail, fresh out of jail, california dreaming
soon as i step on the scene, i'm hearing hoochies screaming
fiending for money and alcohol
the life of a westside player where cowards die and the strong ball
only in cali where we riot not rally to live and die
in l.a. we wearing chucks not ballys (yeah, that's right)
dressed in locs and khaki suits, and ride is what we do
flossing, but have caution: we collide with other crews
famous because we throw grams
worldwide, let them recognize from long beach to rosecrans
bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's westside
so you know the row won't bow down to no man
say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from dre
let me serenade the streets of l.a
from oakland to sac-town, the bay area and back down
cali is where they put their mack down
give me love!

i was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
fiendin' for wicked adventures, ambitious as i was
picture a nigga on the verge of livin' insane
i sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
now tell if i'm wrong
but sayin' "fuck the world" got you deeper in my songs
drinkin' 'til i earl, spendin' money 'til it's gone
it's the good life - maybe niggas got it goin' on
now maybe if i died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
bad boy niggas eat a dick a day, bumpin' this
lord have mercy it's a slaughter
so wicked that my tracks is wettin' niggas like it's water
i learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
but i'm a baller now, nigga, i live the good life


this is the good life, fuck my foes
god bless the dumb niggas that, trust the hoes
found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die
see, we live the good life, fuck my foes
god bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die


no one knows what the, future holds, for you
haha, listen closely
they say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
my after time is narrow, peepin' down the barrel of a foe
just a nigga or a killer i don't know so
who makes the call will i fall a victim like the rest?
slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure i'm gone
send me home all alone in these cold streets
in desperation constantly drinkin' and i can't sleep
neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
some wanna die i wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
let me modify this whole region
i declare this sucker duckin' season, give me the reason
why i should change, into a softie
.. after livin' so loftily
it cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world
me, my niggas, and my girl - livin' the good life!


we live the good life, fuck my foes
god bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die
uh ha, we live the good life, fuck my foes
god bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die


i spend my days and nights not knowin' if, strays in flight
gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
clearly over the edge, soon as i wake up
last night we off the hook, doin' way too much
but it's the fast lane only, big dealin' big ceilin'
all for the money, some kill some squeal
all for the money, most ain't even real
but we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
i watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin'
bitch nigga get to runnin' 'fore my click get to gunnin'
still in the midst of all the stress and pain
we still tryin' to get a hold of the game
livin' that good life


we live the good life, fuck my foes
god bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die, uh
we live the good life, fuck my foes
god bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't, uh
we live the good life, fuck my foes
god bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die, uh
this is the good life, fuck my foes
god bless the dumb bitches that, trust these hoes
found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die

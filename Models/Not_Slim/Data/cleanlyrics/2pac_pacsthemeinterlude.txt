i was raised in this society so there's no way
you can expect me to be a perfect person cuz i'm a do what i'm a do
i am still thirsty
(there is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published
it has no place in our society.)
they gotta understand me
(withdraw on this record.)
that's how i feel i'm a do whatever i like. i am not a role model

westside, death row, outlaw, ridaz, 
untouchable mob of pistol packers, 
well-known felons labeled for 'drug-selling merciless jackers', 
forever buzz, roll with thugs and dogs, 
commence the letting off rounds, then escape in the fog

i was raised by drunks, so i became a drunk.
eighty proof for this rocker, that's the name i want.
or the aisle in the back, bump a seven deuce.
see that top on that forty, you know it's comin' loose.
see me on the av. daily, we runnin' this shit.
if your chick get loud, i g-money that bitch.
packin mags and clips, i'll smash your clique.
because of proof they put the "g" in the alphabet.

 i'm the devil. if ever there was such a thing
the results of much too many drugs what you're seeing
i'm a mindfuck, completely dis-(gus)-ting
i'm (white), a human mutt, fuck a being
i'm a dog - fuck lambs, i'm silencin 'em all
i'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor

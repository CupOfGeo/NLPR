hahaha, right, thug for life, nigga
can't you read the signs?

mobbin' like a motherfucker, stuck
can you picture a middle finger out the window
gettin' fucked of liquor; get loaded, can't control it
nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it
you get the bozack to the ho-stack, that's for sho', black
so be a mack and keep your dough fat
and tell me, what does it take to be a g?
i started with a quarter ounce, soon bounced to a ki'
you gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert
started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt
and now i'm in the rap game
like the crack game, i got enemies
can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
and even thug motherfuckers wanna have fun
stuck in, buckin' my motherfuckin' magnum
what does it take to be a g?
silence is a must, violence is a plus
bust shots at my adversaries, them niggas scurry
pick a spot to be buried
'cause i'll be buckin' in a fuckin' hurry

thug for life, high 'til i die
when them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
shootin' crooked ass cops, let me fry
do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
raise hell, when them niggas mention me

thug for life, high 'til i die
when them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em


game thicker than most of these tricks
i got my mind on makin' money
but you stuck on these fake bitches
and jealous motherfuckers can't see
that's it's the fame that causes
these stupid bitches to pass the pussy free
so tell me, why you sweat a motherfucker like me?
a young nigga tryin' to hustle up some g's
you pussy-ass playa hating hoes
freaking down on niggas, jumpin' around at the shows
and you the first motherfucker to jump
to the trunk when it's time for funk, little trick-ass punk
thug motherfuckers don't die
we get high and we multiply, motherfucker
give a holla to my niggas in the bay
i'm livin' in l.a., still clutchin' on my ak

thug for life, high 'til i die
when them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
shootin' crooked ass cops, let me fry
do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
raise hell, when them niggas mention me

thug for life, beyatch! yeah, nigga
thug life, from now until for motherfuckin' forever
have-nots in this, motherfucker

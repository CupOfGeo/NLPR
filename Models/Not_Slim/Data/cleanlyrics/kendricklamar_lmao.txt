wow, i think y'all must have forgot or something
like i ain't hot or something
like i don't make your girl take off her top or something


i'm like, ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, l-m-a-o
ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, l-m-a-o
laughing at haters in here
i be her favorite in here
she want to play-play
what more can i say-say?

but, mm, jumped in the coupe and i'm gone
i smell like money, i don't need no cologne
i just need me a freak that can jump on the bone
like an x-ray technician, my rectangular prism
says money, sex, then drugs, all cause i'm twenty-one
like playing blackjack, picture this kodak
moment forever, k. dot that dude
she sucked my dick and got frostbite, i'm that cool


i got a pocket full of checks, plus i'm bouncing through the club
with a crazy two-step and diamonds on my neck
ziploc fresh, ziploc fresh
and hoes want to play-play
what more can i say-say?
but ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, l-m-a-o
ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, l-m-a-o
laughing at haters in here
i be her favorite in here
she want to play-play
what more can i say-say?

yeeeaah, bottle of goose and i'm gone
watching her get loose like a third grader's tooth
the shit that we on is the ultimate high
'xxl' flow, that's the ultimate 'vibe'
park that lambi outside just to fuck with the haters
put the lambi in drive, watch it peel like potatoes
holler l-m-a-o with a drunken two-step
like i never could pass a sobriety test



yeeeah, i'm in the club acting mannish
 lenses, make my view panoramic
i'm out of this world, i'm off of this planet
they don't say k. dot is here, they say his spaceship has landed
and your access has been granted/granite, like a kitchen floor
but my kitchen's marble, i ride in the carpool
because i got two whores in the back of that roam
see they're all i need, like a layup from a loan

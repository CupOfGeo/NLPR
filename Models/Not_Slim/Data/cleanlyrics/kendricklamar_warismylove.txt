look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
i never felt the feeling of euphoria
pain forever, prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
wake up in the morning and i gotta win
not taking the victory, thats my only sin
and so i send a message to your messenger
a warning shot to let em know im serious
im ready for a war
when i roar it can break a glass window
the only thing for sure is the perfect way
to bend you on your back
even if i gotta slither through the cracks
i can crack every code you deliver i attack
every hole with a bomb squad sittin on the tripod
even if he try hard, he can still die hard
run but you cant hide
white flags, you can pull em out fast
and tell me your last goodbye


i will, i will, climb the highest mountain
before the flood comes
and all my fight is drowning in blood
what i gotta lose? what i gotta prove?
i guess, war is my love


make sure your next move is slick
your best move is nothing
you know i take risk, dark clouds, i love it
cause i can hide in the mist
hop out and crushin every soldier youre with
so im six for six
im sick with determination, ill terminate ya quick
i lead the pack, i follow no rules, i see the traps
i know youre close to fallin on your face
unload, reload, hand me another case
explode, explode
the fire of my eyes
is waiting on your demise
i know you hope your help is close by


i will, i will, climb the highest mountain
before the flood comes
and all my fight is drowning in blood
what i gotta lose? what i gotta prove?
i guess, war is my love
war is my love
i guess, war is my love

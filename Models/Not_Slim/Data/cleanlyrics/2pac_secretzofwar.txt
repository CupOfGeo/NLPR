you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
it's as simple as that for me and my niggas


war time, war time, it's either yours or mine
outlawz be on the grind and a mission to shine
and ride on 'em, leave 'em stuck and fucked from the gate
set it straight, regulate, with a bomb i'm about to detonate
boom! hesitate? aww, now you know what
ya'll niggas were here to go if you know it was good for ya
bunch of toy soldiers all dressed in fatigue
but i'm e.d.i. amin on a mission to make 'em bleed
nigga what? nigga who? it was cool? and at you?
what the fuck is you gonna do? barbecue and boo-hoo
ride or die, get money, all at the same time
split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
any nigga slippin', fall at the same time
we all links in the chain, tryin' to gain, do time
we all see the sunshine, but when you could do yours
we'll bring these motherfuckers war


you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
it's as simple as that for me and my niggas


as i approach the scene
from smokin' green got my eyes closed
niggas so cold on my foes, i make 'em die froze
watch me make 'em bleed, makin' g's, lord, help me with it
got me paintin' pictures of a meal ticket, help me get it
see me and pray for options, but the pressures nonstop
niggas get the pistol poppin' and watch his body drop
i'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set, flash on
blast on them bitch-made niggas with my mask on
do it for profit, plus i'm lookin' for punks to bust on
if you ain't screamin' "westside!" you can get the fuck on
i'm seein' demons, hittin' weed, got me hearin' screamin'
scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope fiend
probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
i live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
niggas pass the clip and watch me bring 'em to the floor
got some shit that they ain't ready for: i got the secrets of war


you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
see it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
look it's as simple as that for me and my niggas


we do this thug life shit, like four, five, six, stick 'em
down with no rounds left up in the pound when the sounds
squeeze the lead off, i blow his motherfuckin' head off
signal all the other outlawz to get this shit set off
yaki kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
these streets is black hockey and raw, we get sloppy
put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar, locked in the slammer, while i'm laid cocked back like a hammer
ya'll newly weds that in honey moons, times 'bout up, y'all
that means i leave no trace found with you face, bounce stuck
your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gon' do?


you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
see it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
look it's as simple as that for me and my niggas


check the murder rate percentage, niggas is finished
get blood checks from clinics, this thug shit is in us
flowin' through my system, you a victim
blunts, i twist 'em. fuck the whole world, it's us against them
you got some heat? pull it out, cock the hammer if you with it
don't make no difference here with the twenty-five-to-life sentence
we already doin' life on the streets
like al g., niggas be heated when they walkin' the beat
this shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggas hate me
scared to face me, knowin' that the outlawz blaze me
pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle
once i suck my money muscle, all the g's got devils
movin' shit like a dollar, beatin' niggas like rodney
turn a killer like kadafi, and a nuke stream to stop me


you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
see it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
look it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
man it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
you either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
see it's as simple as that for me and my niggas


(bring it on), and all you lil' young ass soldiers
you play this shit back about fifteen times (talk about it)
you'll have enough game to roll up in a club or somethin' (e'ry body tough)
teach these bitches a lil' somethin'
you know what i mean? secrets of muthafuckin' war

straight motherfuckin' ballin', part two
still ballin', westside!


now, ever since a nigga was a seed
only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
still ballin', ridin' on these niggas 'cause they lame
in a 'sixty-one chevy, still heavy in this game
can you feel me? blame it on my mama, i'm a thug nigga
up before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb
bust on these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up, westside!
ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga
finger on the trigger, lord forgive me if i smoke niggas
i love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
i get my currency in stacks, california is where i'm at ridin'
passed by while these niggas wondered why
i got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
did i cry? hell nah, nigga, tears shed, for all my homies in the pen, many peers dead; a nigga still ballin'


still ballin' until i die (until i die)
you can bring your crew, but we remain true
motherfucker, still ballin' (i be ballin')
niggas wonder why (they wonder why)
you can bring your crew, but we remain true
motherfucker, still ballin'


now, as i kneel and pray i hope the lord understand
when he's gone, devolve, i become a dangerous man
ain't crazy or deranged, i'm sayin'
but when these kids go to spray 'em, boy, won't be playin'
with clientele, any rhyme sales
question is: will you fuck-niggas ride for real, huh?
bitch nigga, this is g-rated
plus your homeboy won't make it, street game fugazi
i'm elevated to the top of this shit
done fucked around and put me and twopac on the bitch
and you can tell 'em "thug life" was the reason for this
and i ride for any nigga who believe in the shit; still ballin'


until the day i die
you can bring your crew, but we remain true
motherfucker, still ballin'
niggas wonder why
you can bring your crew, but we remain true
motherfucker, still ballin'


now everybody wanna see us dead
two murdered on the front page
shot to death, bullets to the head
niggas holla out my name and it's similar to rape
motherfuckers know i'm comin', so they runnin' to they graves
watch! swoop down with my nigga from the pound
'cause trick don't give a fuck
where you coward niggas now?
blast, keep pumpin', ain't worried about nothin'
busters thought we was frontin'
so reload and keep dumpin'; still ballin'


(i'm still ballin') 'til the day i die ('til i die)
you can bring your crew, but we remain true
motherfucker, still ballin' (i be ballin')
niggas wonder why (they wonder why)
you can bring your crew, but we remain true
motherfucker, still ballin'
'til the day i die (still ballin')
you can bring your crew, but we remain true
motherfucker, still ballin'
niggas wonder why (tell 'em!)
you can bring your crew, but we remain true
motherfucker, still ballin', until the day i die
(thug life), still ballin'
motherfucker, still ballin'
straight motherfuckin' ballin'

and if another doubts i blow your fuckin' mother out
and after she's crossed out
i shout, "i'm de mc wit de nasty mouf!" and kick the bitch out

yeah, as i take a puff i get rough, big mad
to put it on, can't none come tougher see
i'm down with the sound of the squad hard, boom!
breakin' 'em down, i make 'em see their doom
coming straight from the dome where i roam it's a job to
rob and steal and runnin' from the coppers
who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
started from a punk now to be a high roller
youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
mac-eleven blaster, and i run faster
than a lot of cops i can't be stopped till my head gets popped
a lot of fuckin' bodies will drop
it's a disaster, i'm coming for the blood splatter
i make 'em scatter, leavin' trails of brains and bladders
blowin' 'em out the frame with no shame
game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
count my loot after i shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
something i don't wanna do, something that i never did
i try to get him, i think i hit 'em, i lit him
he's out! a poison, a deadly venom

(yeah mad, fuck that! you know how we do

'cause i'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four mag
so nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag

a nigga hit 'em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom

(nigga, yaknowhati'msayin? fuck that!

five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
strugglin' and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
take mine, you better bury me, g
punk ass niggas don't even worry me, see
i got a glock that say 'pac run the block
fuck the cops 'cause my gauge gets me... paid
as i sit and reminisce about the old days
hugging on my ak, fuck getting played, hey
i say niggas need to get they mind right
until they do i pop a clip and grip my nine tight
now it's on everyday could be my last day
that's why i blast on they ass as i passed let the glass spray.

now your mouth's full of chunks, pac's out puffin' blunts

my act guards me so hard i pull the fuckin' trigger

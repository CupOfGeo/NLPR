old school new school need to learn though
i burn baby burn like disco inferno
burn slow like blunts with ya-yo
peel more skins than idaho potato
niggaz know, the lyrics molestin is takin place
fuckin with b.i.g. it ain't safe
i make your skin chafe, rashes on the masses
bumps and bruises, blunts and landcruisers
big poppa smash fools, bash fools
niggaz mad because i know that cash rules

two tears in the bucket i cry with you
but i could never lie with you
i could never afford not to afford
i could never put my plans to the side with you
i could never see a red light
like a deer with a headlight
i freeze up when i re-up
see i rarely have patience
and you're relating
only the moment to complete us
why you hate to work for it?
the reason why i hate to wait for it?
see a nine to five was so jive turkey
but when thanksgiving came that check didnt hurt me
you plead the fifth
i read the fifth amendment
we both criminals with bad intentions
they say time heals all
but if i could shortcut
my success, corvettes by tomorrow

but why you so sad?
walking around with them blue faces
they say im down on my luck
and its something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money, and its breaking me down to the top

my home girl got a credit card scam
she got a scholarship to college but she dont give a damn
intuition got a black woman wishin'
she sayin' this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
i know you, woman, i console you, woman
you feel like the universe owes you, woman
oh the anticipation, hoping you could make it
women don't prosper chasing education
but you're talented, and can't handle it
and your homegirls can't be your manager
three hundred and sixty-five times four, plus more
can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
but ain't no money like fast money
even today i'm considered a crash dummy
a rapper chasing stardom, how can i fast forward?
my accolades better than all them

but why i'm so sad?
walking around with them blue faces
they say im down on my luck
and its something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money, and its breaking me down to the top

i love god, i love speed, i love drank, i love me
i love oceans in the deep
i love women, i love me
i love god
but im scared of god speed
sometimes

wrote this song looking at a broke home maybe
you know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and baby
somebody say "kendrick american, they sho is crazy"
and i said why?
then he looked me in the eye
he said homie you messed up
you breaking my good luck
you wishing for miracles
living through shit, youre crying hysterical
settle for everything, complain about everything
say your soul crack, my world amphetamines
you projects aint it, i live in a hut
you living to keep warm
im living to pay rent
i paid my way through
praying to allah
you played your way through dealing with wi-fi
go ish yourself, you talking to strangers
same thing go for the ones you came with
we all came on the boat looking for hope
and all you can say is that youre looking for dope
these days aint no compromise
your pain aint mine half the time
a brand new excuse aint nothing to me
see i made my moves, with shackled feet

cape town, cape town, cape town, cape town
cape town, cape town, cape town

cornrow kenny
all morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr
morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr, skrr
cornrow kenny
so many plays on me i finesse
palisade views with some sex
i lost a lot of love for missionary
this the first time i react
me and top is like a kobe and phil
a father figure play with him, you get killed
play with me and he will kill you himself
tde the mafia of the west
move in silence, yeah, we juggin like that
act of violence, yeah, we juggin like that
i did a lot of dumb things in my past
love will give me hope and i wont relapse
dave just bought a new nine eleven
almost thought id seen another plane crash
q just bought a brand new mclaren
rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
moosa got his son dripping in gold
me? i'm about to let my hair down on hoes
ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
top billing thats a million a show
might blow the whole remy on soul
might tell obama be more like punch
sounwave got a grammy this year
mack wop, bet he do what he want

level two, level two
no im not done
you aint gotta tell me that im the one
i could put a rapper on life support
guarantee something that none of you want
then hold me down and they yell something like
rent is like twenty five hundred a month
what if i empty my bank out and stunt?
what if i empty my bank out and stunt?
you aint gotta tell me that im the one
you aint gotta tell me that im the one
you aint gotta tell me that im the one
you aint got, you aint got
you aint got, you aint got
tell me that, tell me that
that, i am the one
you aint got, you aint got
you aint got
you aint got tell me that, what im the one
yes, im the one

i could be wrong but i never got along with cops
it's like they stuck from makin' niggas duck from glocks
and all the time, my mind's full of thoughts of ends
i'm still rollin' my bucket but i bought me a benz (tadow)
my fake friends say they love me but i know they lie
cause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide
my mama cried when they took me off to jail
only me inside the cell, straight locked up in this hell
i hear some sucker screamin' like the demon's inside
will 'em away in the mornin', only the strong survive
i cry, but in my own way swallow my pride
pick a reason to hide from all the niggas that die
cemetery full of brothers i buried it's goin' down
even now i wonder will i still be around
my hometown is the gutter i was born a wild
i came up out this dust with my heartless style

these, niggas don't know my style
quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style

try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style

i remember uptown, run catch a kiss
listenin' to mr. magic
cuttin' up the hits and even though i had a habit
makin' words rhyme i was caught up in the madness
juvenile thugs come on
i tell the whole story nothin' but truth
halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
and pete and lee young g's with a gift of gab
tryna hook up with the hookers who was quick to stab remember mama's cookin', no school straight hookin'
and tryin' to get with light skinned cause she good lookin'
and jumpin' over turnstiles cause we ain't payin'
call the cuties cuss words but we only playin'
i'm prayin' i can get a buck no luck
i had to move around a lot cause my moms was stuck
i had family but i was way too wild
had to move to the west to regain my style

these, niggas don't know my style
quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)

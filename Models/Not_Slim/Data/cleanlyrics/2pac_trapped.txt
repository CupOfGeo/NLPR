you know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness, living on the streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me
'cause they never talk peace in the black community
all we know is violence, do the job in silence
walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for the big pen
niggas comin' out worse-off than when they went in
over the years i done a lot of growin' up
getting drunk, throwin' up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route, way out
to money and fame, i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harasses me i just might go psycho
and when i get 'em, i'll hit 'em with the bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the uzi
they got me trapped

uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
they got me trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down

they got me trapped
can barely walk the city streets
without a cop harassing me, searching me
then asking my identity
hands up, throw me up against the wall
didn't do a thing at all
i'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on the concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didn't know this was the wrong street
bang, bang, count another casualty
but it's a cop who's shot for his brutality
who do you blame? it's a shame because the man's slain
he got caught in the chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all the things they did to me?
sweated me, hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day i'm gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me?
i couldn't find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie, don't play that
it's time i let 'em suffer the payback
i'm trying to avoid physical contact
i can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
they got me trapped

uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
they got me trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down

now i'm trapped and want to find my getaway
all i need is a 'g' and somewhere safe to stay
can't use the phone
'cause i'm sure someone is tapping in
did it before
ain't scared to use my gat again
i look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant
but now he's the devil's friend
too late to be tellin' him
he shot first and i'll be damned if i run away
homie is done away, i should've put my gun away
i wasn't thinking, all i heard was the ridicule
girlies was laughin', tup saying, "damn homies is dissing you."
i fired my weapon
started steppin' in the hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin' a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin' for my getaway
coppers said, "freeze, or you'll be dead today."
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldn't see the light
thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
what do i do? live my life in a prison cell?
i'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped

uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
they got me trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
trapped
naw, they can't keep the black man down

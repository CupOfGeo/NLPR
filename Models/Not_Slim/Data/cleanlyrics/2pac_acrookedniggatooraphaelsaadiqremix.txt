yo 'pac yo, i heard you got beat up by the police
got a big fat lawsuit and everything
niggas just wanna know
if you still gon' be on some crooked-ass sheeeit


please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true
ain't nuttin new, so i do, what i can to get through
now first they had me trapped and now i'm pissed
a loaded ak-forty-seven lay under my head so i don't trip
one motherfucker from the underground
and big stretch bucking niggas if they fuck around
yo why i got beef with police?
ain't that a bitch that motherfuckers got a beef with me
they make it hard for me to sleep
i wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are three feet deep
i guess it's hard for you to see
but now i'm pointing the finger at police
instead of them motherfuckers blaming me
i got the right to bear a pistol
and when the punk motherfuckers get to tripping i got shit too
and maybe then you'll see the truth (hell yeah)
but until then, i gotta do what i do
and stay a crooked nigga too


i've got to do, what i'm gon' do
i'm gon' say what i'm gon' say
i'm gon' live how i live - how else you want a nigga to live?
i'm gon' do, what i do
i'm gon' say, what i say
i'm gon' live how i live - how do you want a nigga to live?


y'know you really can't say that ya blame niggas
fuck being tame, set aflame, time to aim triggers
twopac'll spark a revolution, fuck the constitution
i want my bucks for restitution
this time you got a bigger problem
time to face the niggas from south central, oakland, brooklyn and harlem
and we ain't shooting at each other
that's my motherfuckin' brother, so dave duke, run for cover
and all the bitches from the klan
come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
i don't drink st. ides (fuck that!)
genuine draft, ganja ganja, and my fuckin' tec-nine
they know they scared to see us sober
stop drinking king cobra, and niggas'll take the world over
it's all up to you (up to you)
blame the korean, blame the jew, or be a crooked nigga too


i've got to do, what i'm gon' do
i'm gon' say what i'm gon' say
i'm gon' live how i live - how else you want a nigga to live?
i'm gon' do, what i do
i'm gon' say, what i say
i'm gon' live how i live - how do you want a nigga to live?


aiyyo! why me? play like jasmine guy and try me
i'll be damned if i die, come look at the rage in my eyes g
they got my homies in a jail cell
and it's the rebel and the devil, and one of us is going to hell
i got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
and nuttin but love for each other
so motherfucker make a motion
i give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
temperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga
but they hate it when we pop the cops
that's when they getting petrol
you better watch your step or you'll be left on death row
but i learn to look ahead of me
stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
we blowing up precincts and oooh
you can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too


i've got to do, what i'm gon' do
i'm gon' say what i'm gon' say

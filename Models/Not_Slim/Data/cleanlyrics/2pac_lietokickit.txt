polyurethane busta cracked in half
you claim you foldin' bank but i know yo bank stank
i lived around the corner i seen you fully smoked
must i say some more you weighed a buck four
you sold ya tv for a buck cause it was way too late
now they sent you upstate and you done gained some weight
you's a baller lyin' to them youngstas quick
got them thinkin' you sick and representin' yo click
but you's an old basehead kickin' too much hype
yo bicentennial pipe it got rally stripes
and if they knew yo identity
you'd probably be the victim of a stickin' (ugh ugh)

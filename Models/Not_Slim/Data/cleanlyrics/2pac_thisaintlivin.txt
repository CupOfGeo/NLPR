this ain't livin', nigga!


i hear even the smaller g's be dippin' chevy impalas
while flossin' their gold d's, o.g.'s, is who they follow
we swallow tomorrow's seed, what we leave is hollow
we feed violence and greed, let 'em lead tomorrow
in time, they grip a nine, sippin' wine, they rap
still i be starin', watch the parents sacrifice their child
the love's gone, a thug's home, with no love
feelin' so strong, make young boys into drug dealers
now one for adolescents, now dos for those
keep your friends by your side, even close your foes
now three for johnny law tryin' to take my chips
i never pulled the trigger, didn't touch that bitch
throw your hands in the air, it's a robbery
(censored) 'pac, would you ride with me?
let's go see what our enemies talkin' 'bout
when g's enter the house nobody's walkin' out
this ain't livin', it's similar to prison, we're trapped
my homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped
i watch my back twenty-fo' seven
and never let a busta send a g to ghetto heaven, you know
this is how it goes when we floss with flows
before i toss your ho, it'll cost you mo'
i do shows, make a lot of dough, murder my foes
but i'd give it all up, if it would help you grow
this ain't livin'


takes a life to make a life, takes a life
livin' in the world of crime and i, takes a life
(this ain't livin')
can't find a better way to break through
(this ain't livin', i gotta do what i gotta do)
(this ain't livin')
takes a life to make a life, takes a life
livin' in the world of crime and i, takes a life
can't find a better way to break through
this ain't livin', i gotta do what i gotta do


peep it  gunfire is produced at alarmin' rates
today's youth, quick to shoot, get in the car and break
"it takes a nation of millions" if we intend to stop the killin'
just search your feelings, participatin' should be appealin'
they're our seeds and when they bleed, we bleed
that's what becomes of lonely children, they turn to g's
heavenly father can you rescue
my young nation, rest the lord will protect you, respect due
not a threat as i step in blue, and check those
that oppose when i froze them fools
and who are you, to watch me fall farther?
i disappeared, reappeared as the (censored)
follow me now
skippin' class, and livin' fast, will get your ass
stuck in the pen', doin' life plus ten
young brother pump your brakes for me
before you choke, won't you soak up some game from your big homie
this ain't livin', we givin' you jewels, use 'em as tools
explode on they industry and fade them fools
you know the rules, gotta be a rider
you can run the red lights but read the street signs, hey
this for all of y'all that keep on raisin' hell
put a pistol in your hand and let you fade yourself
it ain't right, what you put your momma through, young g
gotta change your life, take the game from me
this ain't livin'


takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
livin' in the world of crime and i (takes a life)
can't find a better way to break through
this ain't livin', i gotta do what i gotta do
takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
livin' in the world of crime and i (takes a life)
can't find a better way to break through
this ain't livin', i gotta do what i gotta do
takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
livin' in the world of crime and i (takes a life)
can't find a better way to break through
this ain't livin', i gotta do what i gotta do
takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
livin' in the world of crime and i (takes a life)
can't find a better way to break through
this ain't livin', i gotta do what i gotta do

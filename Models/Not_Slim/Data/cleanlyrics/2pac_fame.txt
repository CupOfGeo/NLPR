and my niggas say 
we want the fame!
come on! come on!


one thing we all adore 
something worth dyin' for
nothin' but pain
stuck in this game 
searchin' for fortune and fame


though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to g's
stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
they got me hot when they shot me, plotted
my revenge to increase my ends; enemies gettin' dropped
win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true
play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
and for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame
what's to gain, lost souls? who controls our brain?
who can i blame? the world seems strange at times
somewhat insane, i'm hopin' we can change with time
i'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse
i know, death follows me, but i'll murder him first
and worse yet, with each breathe, steps i take, breathless
is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses
we mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask
i'm the first one to want him blasted
wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit
ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me
nothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fakin' fame


block run and shoot slugs 
we throw them back like hardballs 
without the gloves, no love for these fake desperadoes
and thugs i bleed to envy 
smoke and blow out they blunts, sippin' henny
drunk nights, and hot days
cockin' my heat, shootin' it sideways
a wife on the run, full of common blunts
unconditionally married to my gun
fulfillin' my destiny on knees and one's desires
be pullin' all my cabbage like priors, stuck in the trance
searchin' for something higher, the fortune and fame


one thing we all adore
something worth dyin' for
nothin' but pain
stuck in this game
searchin' for fortune and fame
one thing we all adore
something worth dyin' for
nothin' but pain
stuck in this game
searchin' for fortune and fame


searchin' for fortune and fame, lost in the rain
a lost of the game, with life the cost of the game
we forcin' the change, motherfuck flossin' a chain
all the blame belongs to the part of the brain
that we never use, nigga, plus my heart is in pain
and if i ever lose, homie, bet i'm at it again
outlaws don't die, so united we stand
and if family come before, all the fortune and fame


as i walk up in the crib, laid to rest my head
say salaam to the angels, hope they bless my bed
hope they bless me the righteous way 
got a homie locked down outta town, i sent him a kite today
man, that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it, dawg
prayin' for my downfall, and i can sense it, dawg
i was passed down the street fame 
like glocks clocked and keep aim
was raised up with a clock box 
and i ran with the local street gang 
they say the light is faded but still shine in the dark
you can easy been a man, but you's a boy in your heart
and that's some game that i got from generation of game
in the road of life, dog
we need to switch up lanes  think about it!


one thing we all adore
something worth dyin' for
nothin' but pain
stuck in this game
searchin' for fortune and fame
one thing we all adore
something worth dyin' for
been nothin' but pain
stuck in this game
searchin' for fortune and fame


i can't complain, i've seen my fair share of the fame
it won't change me, now i've got this piece of change
i feel strange, i got so used to the hood
that when i finally got out at first it ain't feel good
i was just a baby, still retarded from slavery
when we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me
ghetto ain't made me, i made myself
poverty raised me, thinking ain't no help
i pray for my health, my mind, and my family too
state of myself, my grind, and my family crew
where one hand washes the other
no, we ain't blood, but we still real brothers
the struggle is real, nothin' can steal what we build
and that remains the same 'til the day that we killed
and that's real, life that i was aimed to be
love by my family tree, that's fame to me  how about it?


one thing we all adore
something worth dyin' for
nothin' but pain
stuck in this game
searchin' for fortune and fame
one thing we all adore
something worth dyin' for
nothin' but pain
stuck in this game 
searchin' for fortune and fame

all around the world, same song
all all around the world same song



i came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on
eat popcorn, watch you move your body to the pop song
that i'm singing, dinga-linging, funky beats ringing
everybody's swinging in the place
as i kick the j-a-z-z-y style
r&amp;b mixing it with the hip hop swing beat
champagne in my hand, it won't be long till i'm gone
it's just the same old song


it's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kicking
sweat dripping, girlies in the limo eating chicken
oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose
i love ya rover, move over, i gotta blow my nose
sneezing, but still i'm pleasing to all the slimmies
pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a jenny
if it's good and plenty, don't you know
there i go, there i go, there i go
but i don't go nowhere without my jim hat
if i'm rapping, cause she's clapping
then i'm strapping cause i'm smarter than that
then girlie maybe we can get along
cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song

all around the world, same song
all all around the world same song



money b, the freaky deaky, the sqeaky meaky up and down
as a matter of fact ill be right back i gotta take a leak
so i'm draining entertaining, but i got fame
and the bases i touch too much for me trying to be naming
aiyyo, you saw me on cable and grinned
i busted in and i was gone with the wind
clark gable back in oakland its the same old song
sport these shorties, same freckles and hat
drinking the same fortys


hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip
just like butter, my rhymes are legit
cause i'm the humpty. not humpty dumpty, but humpty hump
here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a hump


ah shut up and just listen
not dissing don't get me wrong
but to me its just the same old song
so just watch, my name is shock, and i like to rock
and you can't stop this
twopac go ahead and rock this


now i clown around when i hang around with the underground
girls used to frown, say i'm down, when i come around
gas me and when they pass me they use to diss me
harass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high
same song, can't go wrong, if i play the nice guy
(claimin' fame, must have changed, now that we became strong)
i remain, still the same (why tu'?) cause it's the same song

all around the world, same song
all all around the world same song

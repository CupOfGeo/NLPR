pawhoo hoo hoo hoo

i don't wanna be your fuckin' man
you stupid you fuckin' idiot (drunk ho)

yo let me fuck that nigga down
what's that?
ay yo what you doin' with that big ass
my ghetto love song (hahaha)
set it off, set it off
let's be friends
where my niggas at
where my niggas, where my niggas
where my niggas at, all my real niggas (throw your muthafuckin' hands up)
where my niggas, where my niggas

let's be friends
(westside in this motherfucker right here, westside)
(throw ya hands in the air)


approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-r tinted
as you pass bye, winkin' my eye, freshly scented
what's the haps, baby? come get with me and perhaps, lady
you can help me multiply my stacks, baby
currency seems small, i need companionship
through with that scandalous shit, i bet your man ain't shit
so why you hesitatin', actin' like yo' shit don't stink?
check out my diamonds, bitch, everyone gonna blink
this be a thug thang, outlaw nigga with riches
cream dreamin', motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
check my rsum, sippin' on cristal and alize
smokin' on big weed, keyed the cali way
don't like trickin', but i'll buy you a fifth
i can't stand no sneaker-wearin' nappy head bitch
let my pedigree, read briefly, they're so cheap
puttin' bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief
mash on my so-called cum, who the man?
while i'm tuggin' on your main bitch head
understand this: ain't no nigga like me, fuck jay z!
he broke and i smoke daily, baby, let's be friends


let's be friends (where my niggas at? c'mon!)
you ain't gotta be my man at all
long as you just bring me your friends
(all my niggas, where my hoes at?)
why you trickin' on them other hoes?
let's be friends! (where the bitches at?
where the niggas with money? where you at, baby?)
you ain't gotta be my man at all
long as you just bring me your friends (cash makin' hoes)
why you trickin' on them other hoes? let's be friends


i met you and i stuttered in passion
though slightly blinded by that ass
it was hard to keep my dick in my pants
every time you pass got me checkin' for you
hardcore, starin' and watchin'
me and you, one on one, picture countless options
was it prophecy? clear as day, visions on top of me
erotic, psychotic, would possess bubonics
far from a crush, i wanna bust your guts and touch
everything inside you from my head to my nuts
you got me sweatin' like a fat girl goin' for mine
just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind
back in time, i recall how she used to be
i guess money and fame made you used to me
what's up in nine-six? fine tricks in drag
fuck dre! tell that bitch he can kiss my ass!
back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen
got my hands on your thighs
now let me in between as friends


let's be friends (westside, motherfucker, right here)
you ain't gotta be my man at all
long as you just bring me your friends
(westside in this motherfucker)
why you trickin' on them other hoes?
let's be friends (westside in this motherfucker right here)
you ain't gotta be my man at all
long as you just bring me your friends
(in this motherfucker right here)
why you trickin' on them other hoes? let's be friends


can you imagine me in player mode? rush the tricks
i got her ready for a booty call, i fucked your bitch
was it me or the fame? my dick or the game?
bet i scream "westside!" when i came (westside!)
scream my name 'cause, baby, it's delicious
ghetto weak spot for pretty bitches up and down
similar to switches
my movement, baby, let your back  it
make it fluid, in and out, all around when a nigga do it
you got me high, let me come inside!
i love it when you get on top, baby, let me ride!
who wanna stop me? am i top notch?
fuck player hatin' niggas, 'cause they cockblock
you probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
made a livin' out of cuss words, liquor and weed
a bad seed turned good, in this world of g's
baby got me fantasizin' seein' you naked
it's the fuck song, so check my record, and let's be friends
where my niggas at? show me where my niggas at?
where my bitches at? thug style!


let's be friends (where my niggas at? where my bitches at?)
(throw yo' guns in the air!)
friends (my ghetto love song!
it goes on and on and on and on)
let's be friends (where my niggas at? where my bitches at?)
(where my niggas at?)
friends (where my niggas at? where my bitches at?)
(where my people at? let's be)


where my people at? show me where my people at!
where my people at? show me where my people at!

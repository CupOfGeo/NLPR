the only way, for me to come back, is by makaveli
that's it! all these motherfuckers stole from me
i'm taking back what's mine


you motherfuckers can't stop me (laughing)
even if i die, i'm gon' be a fuckin' problem
do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
real live black... ghosts
feel me?

some say i'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
papa was a motherfuckin', joke
used to find dope in his coat
and nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
damn, don't get me started
my mama smoked so god damn much
when she was pregnant i'm surprised i ain't retarded
at night i can't sleep, count sheep
as they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
staring at the wall, heard a scream
wake up in the mornin'
see the blood in the hall from the murder scene
don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
as i take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
on the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
and the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(five-zero) i daydream about the dope world
take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
my mossberg goes boom, what's another plug
snatching drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
(give it up nigga) don't run out of breath
every step could be death 'til you blast
and be the last nigga left, then i'll be ghost

don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
as i take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby


a seven-deuce full of niggas goes by
thought i was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep
let me die as i rest in peace, deep
back to these niggas in the seven-deuce
a mac-ten out the window bout to let it loose, what could i do
run for cover and return fire
die motherfuckin die, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
but i let off everything i have
an empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
on my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
barely breathing trying to keep from getting shot down
boo-yaow is the sound, bullet whizzed by
still running like a nigga got nine lives
don't know why but i'm running to my fucking block
took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops
time to be a ghost
(hey man, come the fuck on)
and then we'll be ghost

don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
as i take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby

fuck the police nigga!

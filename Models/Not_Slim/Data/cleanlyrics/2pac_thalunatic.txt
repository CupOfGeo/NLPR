oh shit, jumped on my man's dick
heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick
who's to blame, the guy or the groupie
heard i was down with d.u., now she wants to do me
oooh-wee! this is the life
new bitch every night, never tripped off a wife
it ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick
don't try to flip with the lip cause i run shit
hip hip, hooray for the ak
spray when i lay competition, what a great day
make pay, next is the wet sex
hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex
i'm set, wonder what i tote, check
bloody as a kotex, snappin' motherfuckers' necks
revenge so sweet when it comes from
niggas get done with the drum, watch my foes run
nigga keeps coming when they can't slip
full of that shit, another hit from tha' lunatic


yeah, fuck that god! word up
blowin' niggas out the motherfuckin' frame, you know what i'm sayin'?
constantly, fuck that trick, we ain't havin' it


leave me the fuck alone, you get none of this
it's suicidal, you lose your title like doug-las
cause i'm nothin' nice and, i'm icin' like tyson
i'm grippin' the mic and my dj is slicin'
i'm tired of motherfuckers steppin' to me with the same old
tryin' to do me like nintendo
how the fuck you think i ever got this far?
by bootin' motherfuckers like a shootin' star
cause i'm out to show that i'm a dope mc
think crack had you fiendin', wait'll they get a load of me
bitches on my dick like a motherfuckin' condom
niggas wanna flip, let 'em step, and i'll bomb 'em
see somethin' you want, why don't you come and get it
and then get waxed and taxed, like the government
then i leave you sittin' there, wonder where your money went
while your bitch is callin' me, tellin' me to come again
nigga i'm loc'ed, when i smoke, from the indo
but we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
that's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
lookin' like a bitch, cause your whole fuckin' posse, broke out
punk motherfucker couldn't roll on
he couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga
leave me the fuck alone, you get none of this
feel the wrath, and revenge of tha' lunatic


yeah tu', tell 'em motherfuckers, word up
we ain't havin' it, none of that shit!
bitch ass niggas, niggas can't fuck with us tu', word up
'ninety-one, we takin' this whole motherfucker over
niggas got problems in 'ninety-one, 'ninety-two, and 'ninety-three
and all that other shit, word up


recognize game when it smacks you, bitch i'm back to rip
puttin' this on the map with this mackin' shit
time will tell if it's made well
well i raise hell and excel cause it pays well
jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther
i'm funky, that's word to the father
act like you know 'fore i thump the bolo
thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin' for my solo
oh no, not another new jack, swearin' that he's ruthless
ducked and now he's fucked and left toothless
i can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared
you're scared and you're bound to go
it's somethin', i guess i let the beat keep bumpin'
stop trippin' off these niggas cause they ain't about nuttin'
or should i say naythin'
punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in
i'm sick of the bullshit
come equipped and get ready to rip
or get the dick of tha' lunatic


ah yeah, fuck that, you know what i'm sayin'?
(the motherfuckin' lunatic)
yes tu'!
tell them niggas what time it is, 'kna'm sayin'?
(punk motherfuckers, get the dick of the lunatic)
niggas can't fuck with us, word up
bitch ass niggas, fuck 'em


fuck all them niggas
i'm tellin' these niggas that they ain't got
naythin' on a nigga like me
we squashin' these punk motherfuckers in 'ninety-one
'ninety-two, 'ninety-three, and so on
so let the beat float on
while i spray these punk bitches
with these dope ass lyrics
thanks to poppa for supplyin' the dank
now it's money in the bank
and all y'all niggas shit stank
compared to this shit
fuck y'all punk bitches!
tha' lunatic *echoes*

hell yeah 
hahaha


and uh, i started out dumb, sprung off a hood-rats
listenin' to the radio, wishin' that i could rap
but nothing changed, i was stuck in the game
'cause everybody in the industry was fuckin' me, mayne
listen, i got a scheme, break away, do my own thang
drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
niggas ain't wanna see me rise
ninety-seven watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
and if i catch another case, lord knows how they hate me
got a player in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
i've been dealt a lot of bad cards livin' as a thug
count my blessings and throw my stressings in this land with no love
maybe they seen me rollin', look at all this green i'm holdin'
i get this why they envious and get they eyes swollen
hopin' the heavenly father love a hustler
meet the hardest nigga on the earth to ever bust a nut
my homies tell me, "have a heart"  fuck they feelings
i've been tryin' to make a million since we started, we cold hearted
niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force 
empty out my clip, time to mash, they asked for it
me, makaveli, i'm a motherfucker
we break bread, now we thug brothers, haha
niggas talk a lot of non-shit i choose to ignore it
a war? they ain't ready for it haha


now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
(what y'all gonna do?)
now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
(what y'all gonna do?)
tell me now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
(what y'all gonna do?)
now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you

my nine is thug lord, my mind on my grind
outlawz is my heart, they shine when i shine
(my rhyme is my grind, my team be on role)
(proceed with the onslaught, indeed they all talk)
(they all marks and it's an outlaw holocaust)
when i got the sawed-off. (niggas gettin' hauled off)
yeah, nigga beware, stand clear
this nigga's scared, man, i don't really care
i've been lost love, my heart need a hug
my bite need blood, i fight with a grudge
the life of a thug nigga might need gloves
but you'll never know with a price on your mug
them fight strips snug right around your hands
makin' sure you can never grab the mic again
dog, you fuckin' with a grown man
can't i can't afford to lose
where we from niggas torture dudes
so whatcha wan' do?


now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you

haha, watch me clown, give me lovin' when i'm high
i'm a outlaw baby, i'll be thuggin' 'til i die
in my drop-top, double-r, life as a rap star
hustle like a crack fiend 'til they catch me
go ask somebody to your show 
watching niggas out of sight, in my night scope
cookin' white dope, got my nigga twenty-five-to-life stressed out
tryin' to have all the better things in life
while makaveli  a born leader, ten millimeter
change a nigga's future like a schizophrenic palm reader
heed, from out the bible i read
see the meek shall inherit the earth and the strong will lead
hittin' weed like it's alright
i'm in the studio makin' music all night
my enemies cry whenever i rise, they hated 'til the death
tryin' to beat me out my last breath
what cha gonna do? 


now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you, now nigga now
(what y'all gonna do?)
now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you, throw you hands up
(what y'all gonna do?)
now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you, would you wanna fuck?
(what y'all gonna do?)
now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you, bust 'em, when my niggas come for you
now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you, come for you
(what y'all gonna do?)
now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you

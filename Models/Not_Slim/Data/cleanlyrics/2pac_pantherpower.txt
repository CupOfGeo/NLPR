as real as it seems the american dream
ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
to get us locked up shot up back in chains
to deny us of the future rob our names
kept my history of mystery but now i see
the american dream wasn't meant for me
cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
promised me freedom, education, equality
never gave me nothing but slavery
and now look at how dangerous you made me
calling me a mad man cause i'm strong and bold
with this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
promised me emancipation in this new nation
all you ever gave my people was starvation
fathers of our country never cared for me
they kept my ancestors shackled up in slavery
and uncle sam never did a damn thing for me
except lie about the facts in my history
so now i'm sitting here mad cause i'm unemployed
but the government's glad cause they enjoyed
when my people are down so they can screw us around
time to change the government now panther power

panther power
panther power
panther power


coming straight that resides within
go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
the rich get richer and the poor take less
the american dream was an american nightmare
you kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
the klu klux klan tried to keep us out
besides drew they know no blacks allowed
with intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
but now were impatient
blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs
freedom, equality, then i'll yell out
"don't you ever be ashamed of what you are
it's ya panther power that makes you a star"
panther power

panther power
panther power
panther power


my mother never let me forget my history
hoping i was set free chains never put on me
wanted to be more than just free
had to know the true facts about my history
i couldn't settle for being a statistic
couldn't survive in this capitalistic
government cause it was meant to hold us back
using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack
in my community, they killed the unity
but when i charged them, tried to claim immunity
i strike america like a case of heart disease
panther power is running through my arteries
try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
cause i'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
do you remember that is what i'm asking you?
you think you living free don't let me laugh at you
open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
'cause some time has passed seem you all forget
there ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet
panther power

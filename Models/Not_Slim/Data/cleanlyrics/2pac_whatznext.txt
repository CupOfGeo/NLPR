tell me what the fuck am i suppose to do 
now what's next 
tell me what the fuck am i suppose to do 
now what's next 


caught up in the middle 
my life's a riddle 
don't let it get ya 
i wanna be legal 
but it's this hustle that get me richer 
one love to my peoples makin' money 
i can see you bubblin' 
avoid all trouble 
beware of devils continue strugglin' 
nothing's impossible if there's a will there's a way 
so get your mind on official business 
you can be great 
and it's been this way from the cradle to the grave 
so get paid 
my niggas do this every fuckin' day
we parlay 
through politics and conversation 
this information to my thug niggas in the congregation
watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation 
separation is self destruction 
what's needed is unification 
cause the world ain't hardly scared 
if not prepared 
be sure to be bummy and be no longer there 
but no one cares it's there to share 
all we get is stares 
because of fear we'll evaporate 
say your prayers 

and what's next 

hard livin' got me goin' insane
but i'm addicted to the hustle i'm trapped in the game
whatz next

tell me tell me what the fuck am i suppose to do
whatz next
hard livin' got me goin' insane 
but i'm addicted to the hustle i'm trapped in the game 
whatz next 
i'm goin' crazy

that money gotta make it 
what i gotta do to make it 
do i really gotta take it 
put this mack up to you, face it
doin' what we gotta do to survive 
just ask kweli doin' what we do to get by 
some niggas stick to the crime
pitchin' nickel and dimes 
what the fuck we suppose to do 
who gon' give us a job 
so i tried and tried 
tried to get out the grind 
but the block kept on callin' me back 
fiends kept on callin' for crack 
so i supply 'em wit' that 
gave 'em a reasonable fee 
nigga don't blame it on me 
shit just look where i'm at 
niggas in gardens
lapd is the target 
niggas is heartless hustle regardless
look that dope spot use to be an apartment 
but now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet 
watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet 
we just tryin' hard not to see that coffin 
what's next

hard livin' got me goin' insane
but i'm addicted to the hustle i'm trapped in the game
whatz next

tell me tell me what the fuck am i suppose to do
whatz next

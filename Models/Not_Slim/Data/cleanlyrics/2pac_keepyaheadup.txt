little something for my godson elijah
and a little girl named corin

some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
i say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
i give a holla to my sisters on welfare
twopac cares if don't nobody else care
and i know they like to beat you down a lot
when you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
but please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep your head up
and when he tells you you ain't nothing, don't believe him
and if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'cause, sister, you don't need him
and i ain't trying to gas ya up, i just call 'em how i see 'em
you know what makes me unhappy? when brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
i think it's time to kill for our women
time to heal our women, be real to our women
and if we don't we'll have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man can't make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up?
i know you're fed up, ladies, but keep your head up

keep ya head up, ooh, child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things'll get brighter
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things'll get brighter

ayo, i remember marvin gaye used to sing to me
he had me feeling like black was the thing to be
and suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
and though we had it rough, we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize momma really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had to give her was my pipe dream
of how i'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
i'm trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
it's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
and in the end it seems i'm heading for the pen
i try to find my friends, but they're blowing in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
it's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems the rain'll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up
you know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
they got money for wars but can't feed the poor
say there ain't no hope for the youth
and the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
we ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a set-up
and even though you're fed up
huh, you got to keep your head up

keep ya head up, ooh, child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things'll get brighter
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up, ooh, child
things'll get brighter

and uh, to all the ladies having babies on they own
i know it's kinda rough and you're feeling all alone
daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'cause i think we can make it, in fact, i'm sure
and if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
'cause ain't nothing worse than when your son
wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
you can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man, feeling helpless
because there's too many things for you to deal with
dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
while tears is rolling down your cheeks
you steady hoping things don't fall down this week
'cause if it did, you couldn't take it
and don't blame me, i was given this world, i didn't make it
and now my son's getting older and older and colder
from having the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is driving benz
i'm still trying to hold on to surviving friends
and it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
but please, you got to keep your head up

shit, tired of getting shot at
tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
niggaz need a spot where we can kick it
a spot where we belong, that's just for us
niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be hollywood
y'knahmean? where do niggaz go when we die?
ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
that's why we go to thug mansion
that's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a g
... at thug mansion


a place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
so much pressure in this life of mine, i cry at times
i once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
but when i held that nine, all i could see was my momma's eyes
no one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
picture me inside the misery of poverty
no man alive has ever witnessed struggles i survived
praying hard for better days, promise to hold on
me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
we found a family spot to kick it
where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
a spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we g's
we still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
and in my mind's eye i see this place, the players go in fast
i got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion


every corner, every city
there's a place where life's a little easy
little hennessy, laid back and cool
every hour, cause it's all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright (i wanna go)
nothing but peace (i wanna go) love (i wanna go nigga)
and street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion


a place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rolling by
no policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
no reason, for nobody's momma to cry
see i'm a good guy, i'm trying to stick around for my daughter
but if i should die, i know all of my albums support her
this whole year's been crazy, asked the holy spirit to save me
only difference from me and ossie davis, gray hair maybe
cause i feel like my eyes saw too much suffering
i'm just twenty-some-odd years, i done lost my mother
and i cried tears of joy, i know she smiles on her boy
i dream of you more, my love goes to afeni shakur
cause like ann jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
and just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
where angels soar, with golden wings in thug's mansion


every corner, every city
there's a place where life's a little easy
little hennessy, laid back and cool
every hour, cause it's all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright (i wanna go)
nothing but peace (i wanna go) love (i wanna go nigga)
and street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion


dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
tell the homies i'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
seen a show with marvin gaye last night, it had me shook
dripping peppermint schnapps, with jackie wilson, and sam cooke
then some lady named billie holiday
sang sitting there kicking it with malcolm, 'til the day came
little latasha sho' grown
tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
maybe in time you'll understand only god can save us
when miles davis cutting lose with the band
just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
picture a place that they exist, together
there has to be a place better than this, in heaven
so right before i sleep, dear god, what i'm asking
remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion


every corner, every city
there's a place where life's a little easy
little hennessy, laid back and cool
every hour, cause it's all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright (i wanna go)
nothing but peace (i wanna go) love (i wanna go nigga)
and street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion

after the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
even though we broke for the moment we'll be ballin' again
time to make y'all my military, be prepared for the busters
similar to bitches, too scary, get to near me, we rush 'em
visions of over-packed prisons, millions of niggas thug livin'
pressure's three strikes, i hope they don't test us
so, pull the heat out, ammunition in crates
shh! move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
i'm sensin' niggas is defenseless
i'm hittin' fence's, then gettin' ghost
who can prevent me shootin' senseless?
at these niggas throats 
bitch-made niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
outlaws bustin' while we rushin', we untouchable
fuck you niggas and that bullshit you goin' through!
we outlaws, rushin' you, bustin' you, we untouchable


it's that twopac pac, it's that twopac twopac
(am i wrong 'cause i wanna get it on 'til i die?)

you niggas better not try to run up 
and don't try to say we ain't told ya
you're dealin' with killers and soldiers
nigga, these explosives, tryin' to blow shit
runnin' you over, nigga, controller
whenever y'all niggas try to roll up 
thinkin' i'm a ho, well, come and let me show ya
i'm a light up the rhythm like dosia 
dumpin' so potent, nigga, don't choke up
flow up, makaveli the don
got niggas strapped and ready to bomb
as soon as i send the alarm
and when we're done, we've committed a red rum
leavin' the enemies dead and gone
leavin' them niggas head's blown
'cause they know they dead wrong
when the shots ring out, you know we're comin' through
talk a lot with your mouth, well, what you gon' do?
shut 'em down, busters be knowin'
to keep they distance, thugs don't fuck around
we get back at 'em so swiftly, niggas is with me underground 
slug in a nigga mug, reppin' midwest side
niggas, if you a thug, get your weapon, let's ride
ride for pac, pac, get live for pac, pac
pop off the glock, glock, the thuggin', it don't stop


it's that twopac pac, it's that twopac twopac
(am i wrong 'cause i wanna get it on 'til i die?)
(am i wrong 'cause i wanna get it on 'til i die?)

only wish to breed, i explode into a million seeds
y'all remember me, legendary, live eternally
bury me in pieces, 'cause they fear reincarnation
niggas screamin' peace
'cause they fear when my squad face 'em
take them to places, stake they face
then erase 'em and brake 'em
murder motherfuckers at a rate, and then quicken the pace
blast me, but never ask me to live a lie
am i wrong 'cause i wanna get it on 'til i die?
now i'm worldwide; niggas gossip like girls, then hide
no offense to nas, but this whole fuckin' world is mine
even if you blind, you can still see my prophecy
my destiny to overthrow those on top of me 
fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
can you feel me, dreamin'? seein' scenes of me ballin'?
fuck you bitch-made niggas
and that bullshit you goin' through
outlaws bustin' while we rushin', we untouchable
fuck you niggas and that bullshit you goin' through
we outlaws, rushin' you, bustin' you, we untouchable

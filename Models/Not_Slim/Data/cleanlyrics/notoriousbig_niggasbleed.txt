calm as possible, make the deal go through
if not, here's twelve shots, we know how you do
please make yo killings clean
slugs up in between
they eyes, like true lies
kill em and flee the scene
just bring back the coke or the cream
or else, yo life is on the shelf
we mean this frank
them cats we fucking wit put bombs in yo moms gas tank
lets get this money baby
they shady, we get shady
dress up like ladies
and burn em with dirty three hundred and eighty's
then they come to kill our babies
that's all out
i got gats that blow the wall out
clear them all out
fuck the fallout
word to stretch, i bet they pussy
the seven digits push me
fucking real
here's the deal
i got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five a piece
enough to cop a six buy the house on the beach
supply the peeps with jeeps
brick a piece

everybody getting cream
no one considered a leech
think about it now, that's damn near one point five
i kill em all i'll be set for life
frank pay attention
these motherfuckers is henchmen
renegades, if you die they still get paid
extra probably, fuck a robbery
i'm the boss
promise you won't rob em, i promise
but of course you know i had my fingers crossed


niggas bleed just like us
picture me being scared of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
niggas bleed just like us
picture me being shook
we can both pull burners, make the motherfucking beef cook
niggas bleed just like us
picture a nigga hiding
my life in that man hands, while he just deciding
niggas bleed just like us
i'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
running ain't in my protocol


since it's on, i call my nigga arizona ron
from tuscon, push the black yukon
usually had the slow grooves on
mostly rock the isley
stupid as a youngin, chose not to move wisely
sharper with game, him and his crooks, caught a ?jooks?
heard it was sweet, bout three hundred and fifty a piece
ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
his peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
that's when ron vanished, came back, speaking spanish
lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
he's a criminal
nigga made america's most
killed his baby's mother's brother, slit his throat
the nigga got bagged with the toast, weeded
took it to trial, beat it
now he feel he undefeated
he mean it
nothing to lose, tattooed around his gun wounds
everything, the game, embedded in his brain
and me i feel the same for this money ya dying,
specially if my daughter crying, i ain't lying
y'all know the signs




we agreed that going shooting is silly
because niggas could be hiding in showers with mac milly's
so i freaked em
the telly manager was puerto rican
gloria, from astoria, i went to war with her
peeps in ninety-one, stole a gun from her workers
and they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
we blaze they place, long story
glo seen my face, got shook
thought a nigga was coming for the safe
now she breaking, shut up, one hundred and twelve, whats shaking
a jamaican, some bitches i swear
they look gay
in a black range rover
been outside all day
if its trouble let me know, i'll be on my way
please i got kids to feed, i done seen you make niggas bleed
nightmare this bitch don't need
ron, get the gasoline
this spot, we bout to blow this
get the cash before the cops and range rover cats notice
room one hundred and twelve
right by the staircase, perfect place
when they evacuate, they meet they fate
ron pass the gasoline
the nigga pass me kerosene
fuck it, its flammable
my hunger is unexplainable
strike the match, just what i expected
the dred kid ejected in seconds
and here come two
opposite sexes
one black, one malaysian
we in the hallway waiting patient
as soon as she hit the door we start blasting
i saw her brains hit the floor
ron laughing
i swear to god
i hit maxipriest at least twelve times in the chest
spinned around, shot the chick in the breast
she crying, head shot's put her to rest
pop open the briefcases, nothing but franklin faces
the spots hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
that's when other guests start to slip in
its time for us to get to dipping
i know them niggas in the range is on they way up
flipping, pistol gripping
i load the clip in
the hallway, got real loud and crowded
they walked right past us
i don't know how they allowed it
the funny thing about it
through all the excitement
they range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant
stupid motherfuckers

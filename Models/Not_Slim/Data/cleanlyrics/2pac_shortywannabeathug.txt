said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug!
said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

was a nice middle-class nigga
but no one knew the evil he'd do when he got a little bigger
you'd often find him blazed, for puffing on a newport
plotting on a another way to catch a case
was only sixteen, yet convicted as a felon
with a bunch of old niggas, but you the only one ain't tellin'
i tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
you tell me it's a man's world, play the rules
and fade fools, break rules until we major
blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
was raised up, commence to money-makin' tactics
it's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
my finger's on the trigger
tell the lord to make way for another straight thug nigga
i'm sitting, getting buzzed, looking for some love
from the homies, cause shorty wanna be a thug

said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
one day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he's wanna be, said he's wanna be
one day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

straight from the hall to the pen
an adolescent nigga standing way higher than six feet ten
he carried weight, like a mack truck
gonna bust on playa haters, if them mothafuckas act tuff
then that's when, a lethal weapon with the razor
this little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
no one could figure, when the guns blast, pull the trigger
could take the life of a young nigga, guns bigger
no mother and father, you see, the nigga's all alone
old timers my role model, the war zone
been laced with this game 'til it's a part of me
my heart don't beat no fear, and that ain't hard to see
the future is looking dim
i'm tryin' to make a profit out of living in this sin
i'm in the dark, getting buzzed, looking for some love
out with the homies, cause shorty wanna be a thug

said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
one day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

shorty's gonna be a thug
little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas
gotta stay sharp, nigga, play your part!
got plenty of time (you bad mothafuckas)
you only get three mistakes, and then it's life, big baby
(niggas craaazy) watch the signs!
damn, nigga! sixteen, nigga?
sixteen?! too bad, mothafuckers

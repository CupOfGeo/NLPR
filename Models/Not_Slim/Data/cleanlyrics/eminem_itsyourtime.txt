let it go
gotta let it go
keep living your life cause its your time
your time, your time, your time.

let it go
you gotta let it go
keep living your life cause its your time
your time, your time, your time

have you ever loved someone so much,
you'd give an arm for.
not the expression, no, literally give an arm for.
when they know they're your heart
and you know you are there armor.
and you would destroy anyone that would try to harm her.
but what happens when karma,
turns right around and bites you.
and everything you stand for turns on you to spite you,
what happens when you become the main source of the pain

'daddy look what i made' 
'daddy's gotta go catch a plane'
'daddy, wheres mommy,
i cant find mommy where is she.?'
'i don't know go play hailie baby your daddy's busy'
daddy's writing a song
this song ain't gon' write itself,

i'll give you one underdog
and you gotta swing by yourself
then turn right around in that song
and tell her you lover her.
and put hands on her mother
who's a spittin' image of her.
thats slim shady,
yeah baby slim shady's crazy
shady made me but tonight
shadys rock-a-by-baby.

let it go
gotta let it go
keep living your life cause its your time
your time, your time, your time.

let it go
you gotta let it go
keep living your life cause its your time
your time, your time, your time.


i'm too attached
my heart wont let me fall back.
i got it bad, thats what you can call that
when i see you in the streets
thats the worse for me
used to love the little things you did
thats what works for me.
its too major
don't see you on my pager
know what you doing, where you at or can i see you later?
the fellas tellin me 'just let her go bow'
believe me, i'm tryin man, i just don't know how
i be in all the top spots
leaving with all the hot shots
knowing they just want me cause i'm in the 'top spot'
thats not poppin' and my brain ain't stoppin
thinkin,  who she with, or where she goin,
is she club hoppin'.?
i never had this kind of problem in my life
this is the first time dealin with this kind of fight.
its every night and every flight 
and everytime you in my sight 
damn this ain't even right cause..

let it go
gotta let it go.
keep living your life cause its your time
your time, you time, your time.

let it go
you gotta let it go
keep living your life cause its your time
your time, your time, your time.

i keep havin this dream,
i'm pushin hailie on the swing
she keeps screaming,
she don't want me to sing.
'your making mommy cry, why, why is mommy crying'
'baby daddy ain't leaving no more'
'daddy your lyin, you always say that,
you always say this is the last time,
but you ain't leavin no more, daddy your mine'
she's piling boxes infront of the door
tryin to block it
'daddy please daddy don't leave daddy no stop it'
goes into her pocket
pulls out a tiny necklace locket
its got a picture.
'this will keep you safe daddy take it witcha'
i look up
its just me standin in the mirror
these fuckin walls must be talkin cause man i can hear em
their sayin you got one more chance to do right
and its tonight
now go out there and show em that you love em
before its too late
and just as i go to walk out of my bedroom door
it turns to a stage, there gone
and the spotlight is on.

let it go
gotta let it go
keep living your life cause its your time.
your time, your time, your time

let it go
you gotta let it go
keep living your life cause its your time
your time, your time, your time.

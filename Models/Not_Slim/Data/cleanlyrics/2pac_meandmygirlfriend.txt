shit, you mothafuckin' right!
i'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
when you punk-ass niggas don't
nigga, westside! what?! bring it on!


look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'ninety-six bonnie and clyde, me and my girlfriend
doing eighty-five when we ride
trapped in this world of sin
born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind


c'mon, our childhood years, recall the tears, heart laced with venom
smoking sherm, drinking malt liquor, father forgive 'em
me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
fell in love with the struggle
hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
automatic gunfire exorcising all demons
my mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
we bail out to take the jail back, niggas united
our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
touch you in every secret place, i could hardly wait
to bust freely, got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
make the frontpage primetime live on tv
nigga, my girlfriend, baby forty-five but she still live
one shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop


what?! i'm busting on you punk ass niggas
run, nigga, run! i'm on your ass, nigga
run, nigga! duck and hide when i'm bustin' on all you bitches!
run, nigga! yeah, west side!
uh! uh! uh! die, nigga, die!


my girlfriend: blacker than the darkest night
when niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
i knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
picked you up when you was nine
started out my life of crime with you
bought you some shells when you turned twenty-two
it's true, nothing compares to the satisfaction
that i feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend


all i need in this life of sin
is me and my girlfriend
down to ride to the bloody end
just me and my girlfriend
all i need in this life of sin
is me and my girlfriend
down to ride to the bloody end
just me and my girlfriend


i was too immature to understand your ways
inexperienced back in the days
caused so many arguments and strays
now i realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
being faithful, 'cause now cheating's lethal
we're closer than the hands of time
deeper than the drive of mankind
i trust you dearly, i shoot blind
in time i clock figures, dropping niggas as we rise
we all soldiers in god's eyes
now it's time for war; never leave me, baby
i'm paranoid, sleeping with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
jealous when you hang with the fellas, i wait patiently alone
anticipated for the moment you come home
i'm waiting by the phone, this is true love, i can feel it
i've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
so if you ever need me, call, i'll be there through it all
you're the reason i can stand tall; me and my girlfriend


all i need in this life of sin
is me and my girlfriend
down to ride to the bloody end
just me and my girlfriend
all i need in this life of sin
is me and my girlfriend
down to ride to the bloody end
just me and my girlfriend


i love finger-fucking you, all of a sudden i'm hearing thunder
when you bust a nut, niggas be ducking or taking numbers
love to watch you at a block party, begging for drama
while unleashing on the old-timers, that's on my mama
i would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
the only girl that i adore, everything i'm asking for
talking to me, begging me to just take you around
seventeen, like brandy, you just wanna be down
talking loud when i tell you be quiet
you move the crowd, busting rounds, activating a riot
that's why i love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
after a hit you, break apart, then back to one piece
much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
just hold me down, baby, witness the power
never leave a nigga alone, i love you black or chrome
turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend


all i need in this life of sin
is me and my girlfriend
down to ride to the bloody end
just me and my girlfriend
all i need in this life of sin
is me and my girlfriend
down to ride to the bloody end
just me and my girlfriend
all i need in this life of sin
me and my girlfriend
down to ride to the bloody end
me and my girlfriend


lost in the whirlwind
'ninety-six bonnie and clyde, me and my girlfriend
doing eighty-five when we ride
trapped in this world of sin
born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'ninety-six bonnie and clyde, me and my girlfriend
doing eighty-five when we ride
trapped in this world of sin
born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'ninety-six bonnie and clyde, me and my girlfriend
doing eighty-five when we ride
trapped in this world of sin
born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'ninety-six bonnie and clyde, me and my girlfriend
look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'ninety-six bonnie and clyde, me and my girlfriend
me and my girlfriend

love, let's talk about love
is it anything and everything you hoped for?
or do the feeling haunt you?
i know the feeling haunt you


this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer


tell me what you gon' do to me
confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
you can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
but you can't bring the truth to me
fuck you and all your expectations
i don't even want your congratulations
i recognize your false confidence
and calculated promises all in your conversation
i hate people that feel entitled
look at me crazy 'cause i ain't invite you
oh, you important?
you the moral to the story? you endorsin'?
motherfucker, i don't even like you
corrupt a man's heart with a gift
that's how you find out who you dealin' with
a small percentage who i'm buildin' with
i want the credit if i'm losin' or i'm winnin'
on my momma, that's the realest shit

love, let's talk about love
is it anything and everything you hoped for?
or do the feeling haunt you?
i know the feeling haunt you


this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

skin covered with ego
get to talkin' like a end-forth, like a rebound
no control, no off switch
in the way that you bringin' me down
it's a turn on, get it away from me
know you mean wrong, keep away from me
and it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
i just cry for no reason
i just pray for no reason
i just thank for the life, for the day
for the hours and another life breathin'
how did it all go to feel good?
you could live it all if you feel bad
better live your life
we were runnin' out of time

love, let's talk about love
is it anything and everything you hoped for?

or do the feeling haunt you?
i know the feeling haunt you


this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

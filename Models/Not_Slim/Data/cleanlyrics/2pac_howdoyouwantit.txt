i love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
got a brother wantin' it so bad, i'm about to pass out
wanna dig you, and i can't even lie about it
baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
body talkin' shit to me but i can't comprehend the meanin'
now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
forgive me i'm a rider, still i'm just a simple man
all i want is money, fuck the fame i'm a simple man
mr. international, player with the passport
just like aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
it's either him or me - champagne, hennessy
a favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
but i've been driven by attraction in a strong way
your body is bangin' baby i love it when you flaunt it
time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it


how do you want it?
how does it feel?
comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
livin' in the fast lane
i'm for real

tell me is it cool to fuck?
did you think i come to talk?
am i a fool or what?
positions on the floor
it's like erotic
ironic, cause i'm somewhat psychotic
i'm hittin'' switches on bitches like i been fixed with hydraulics
up and down like a roller coaster
i'm up inside ya, i ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
cause i'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery, i'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
get her rockin' these
nights full of alize
a livin' legend you ain't heard about
these niggas play these cali days
c. delores tucker, you's a motherfucker
instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
worse than the others; bill clinton, mr. bob dole
you're too old to understand the way the game's told
you're lame so i gotta hit you with the hot facts
once i'm released, i'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
they wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
livin' in hell - only a few of us'll live to tell
now everybody talkin' about us i could give a fuck
i'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
nigga, tell me how you want it

raised as a youth
tell the truth, i got the scoop
on how to get a bulletproof
cause i jumped from the roof
'fore i was a teenager, mobile phone, skypager
game rules, i'm livin' major - my adversaries
is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
one of us gonna see the cemetery
my only hope to survive if i wish to stay alive
gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before i die
i wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
and then i'm chillin' fade 'em all
these taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
but i'ma mash out and peel out
im with a clique thats quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
when you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
how do you want it?

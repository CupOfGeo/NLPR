one time
reporting live, compton, california

she go to work, she go to school
her body smooth, no tattoos
type of girl that make your mother feel comfortable
my pops love her too, she's compatible
she's independent, she handle her business
she believe in god and no other religions
never in competition when it comes to her friends
she's dependable, she set her own trends
a confidant, a mediator
so sweet, every flavor
just a conversation with her, doing you a favor
look at her hips, i want to be her pager
conservative, affirmative
action when she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
the beauty of her, a blind man could see
a true queen, and she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
the beauty of her, swear to god a blind man could see
a true queen, and she needs me


that girl is smoking
and can you believe that i'm her focus?
it ain't hard to see she got me open
and together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on


five years later, an accounting major
work at a firm, abundance of paper
she got a career, she look in the rear-
view mirror of a mercedes that she can steer
private bars, executive meetings
consecutive trips, vacation on weekends
dior reeking through her prada dress
probably the only product of a pure success
got a promotion, now she own the building
headed to the top like she on the building
real estate, property
she do tender steak, only one mouth to feed
funded a youth center, invested in some stock
doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
oh what a girl, how great life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me




we lose touch, separated
years pass, i'm out dating
she's dating, one of hollywood's
famous of entertainers, denzel good
paparazzi spot 'em out shopping
tuesday morning brunch, benihana's
tabloids paint the picture of a perfect couple
headline reads, when a famous actor loves you
emmy awards, academy too
on the red carpet, dress matching his suit
she holding his arm, she wave at her moms
then wave at the world, got the world in her palms
head in the clouds, star-gazing
caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
he bent down, got on one knee
she looked him in the eye, and said she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
even if we seem to separate, eventually
it'll come to pass, and she'll need me
i need her... we need we

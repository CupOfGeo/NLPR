you heard it wrong nigga, aint nothing sweet about my techniques
you checkin for my breathless quotes i wrote deadly
my history so thoroughly involves destruction
niggaz left with their ass bleedin, lyrical fucking
open up, first to bust, let me see your heart
turn the lights down, cause i might clown in the dark
when i check for the heartz of men what do we find?
niggaz watchin for my pockets, planning plots on mine
am i blind? let my rhymes speak, for me in history
a legend you define me
don makaveli bitch bow down to death row
fuck what you say we untouchable now that we done shook doc dre
he aint made a beat in six years, swear he the shit
wont get no record sales suckin nas dick
let me get my preach on nigga drop the beat, i get my freak on
the wrong one for you to speak on

de-la got a problem with this hard shit
ever since "me myself and i", yall been garbage
im gonna keep it real, show you how it feels to ride
yall went three feet and stopped risin
wendy williams is a fat bitch, thats the truth
i got a jar full of niggas nuts thats for you
let the westside eastside drama seize
ill come alone to your own streets, outlaw
prepare for panic when i unleash
niggas is lucky if they leave here in one piece
queen puff never had no heart to start
so how the hell biggie smalls get the part?
watch ya mouth


what i bring to you is hard core, the very essence of my poetry
dyslexic so you backward ass niggas will notice me
the only g to bleed for the shit i bring
and swing hard on motherfuckers thats my thing
vocally im pure so you o.d. tryin to throw me
dont get ya life took tryin to run with ya homies, yall know me
same nigga so quick to blast
on this worldwide mash, trying to get some cash

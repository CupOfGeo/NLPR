"nobody's, closing me out of my business"
"nobody's, closing me out of my business"
my definition of a thug nigga
"nobody's, closing me out of my business"

i played the cards i was given, thank god i'm still livin'
pack my nine til it's time to go to prison
as i'm bailin' down the block that i come from, still gotta pack a gun
case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb
i guess i live life forever jugglin'
but i'll be hustlin' 'til the early mornin' cause i'm strugglin'
like drinkin' liquor make the money come quicker
gettin' pages from my bitch it's time to dick her
i ain't in love with her, i just wanna be the one to hit her
drop off and let the next nigga get her
that's the way it goes, it's time to shake a ho, make the dough
break a ho when it's time to make some mo'
i keep my finger on the trigger of my glock
ridin' down the block lickin' shots at the punk-ass cops
and spittin' game through my mobile phone
the type of shit to get them hoes to bone
my definition of a thug nigga


"tis the season, to be servin'"
"what you doin'?"
"mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"tis the season, to be servin'"
"what you doin'?"
"mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"tis the season, to be servin'"
"what you doin'?"
"mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"tis the season... to be servin'"

well i roll with a crew of zoo niggas
they're quick to pull a nine when it's time do niggas
comin' through like i'm two niggas, a true nigga fuck a zig zag
roll me a blunt and pass that brew nigga
i'm drivin' drunk on the freeway, so take it ea-sy
lookin' for a new face to skeeze me
everybody's lookin' for a nut but i'm searchin' for the big bucks
give a fuck, rather die than be stuck
in a one-room shack, and, kickin' back
daydreamin' with the nine in my lap (huh)
so how's that from the mind of a thug nigga
bought a fo'-five cause i heard that the slug's bigger
figure the first motherfucker to jump'll find hisself
gettin' swept off his feet by the pump
i put that on my moms, word to the motherfuckin' trigger
before i go broke i'll be a drug dealer, a thug nigga


"tis the season, to be servin'"
"what you doin'?"
"mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"tis the season, to be servin'"
"what you doin'?"
"mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"tis the season, to be servin'"
"what you doin'?"
"mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"tis the season... to be servin'"

short than a motherfucker snatched up by one-time
make a phone call and be back to ball by lunchtime
so here we go, we in the inner city
i keep my hand on my gat and stay cool, my attitude is shitty
niggas don't like me cause i'm makin' ends
roll in a benz and i blaze a blunt, cause i'm all in
and any nigga tryin' to take what i got'll
hafta deal with the sixteen-shot glock (huh)
so here we go, i can't be faded
happy in the motherfucker, finally made it
got my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger
and i ain't takin' shit from no niggas
i'm just tryin to make some money right
put some motherfuckin' food in my tummy right
i'm feelin' good like i'm supposed to, ready to ball
find a spot and we can serve em all

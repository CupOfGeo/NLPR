uh, first verse, uh
i'm armed/on 'til i'm on a island
my life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
before i touch dirt i kill y'all with kindness
i kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
you've been warned if you've been born or if you conform
slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
and hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
me and shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow
i might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
though i ain't wrapped tight
my blood type's the 'eightys!
my 'ninetys was like the navy, you was like the bradys
you still fly kites daily!


catch me in my mercedes
bumpin' "ice, ice baby" screaming, "shady 'til i die!"
like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
so i live it to the fullest 'til i'm swayze
and you only live it once, so i'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
wait, no, stop me now 'fore i get on a roll (danish)
let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
and i hope that i don't sound too heinous when i say this
nicki minaj, but i wanna stick my penis in your anus!
you morons think that i'm a genius
really i belong inside a dang insane asylum, came to drive them trailer parks
crazy, i am back, and i am razor-sharp, baby
and that's "back" with a capital b with an exclamation mark,
maybe you should listen when i flip the linguistics
'cause i'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit
you don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'cause after i spit the bullets, i'mma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
i'mma kick the ballistics! so get this dick, i'mma live this


livin' life in the fast lane
movin' at the speed of life and i can't slow down
only got a gallon in the gas tank
but i'm almost at the finish line, so i can't stop now

i don't really know where i'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
gon' roll 'til i drop and ride 'til i die
i'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)


my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
at war with a bottle, as captain morgan attacks my organs
my slow flow is euphoric, it's like i rap endorphins
i made a pact with the devil that says "i'll let you take me
you let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse of jack kevorkian"
go back and forth in more beef than you can pack a fork in
i'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
my tenement, chimney now; the semis the remedy, pow
spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity


now, was called m&amp;m, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
chewed him up and spitted him out
girl, giddy-up, now get, get down
he's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit-fit now
here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
did i s-st-stutter, motherfucker? fuck them all,
he shuts the whole motherfuckin' walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
and he came to the club tonight with five'nine to hold this bitch down
like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, she tryna d-dr-drown
shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick suckin' lips, i'm agitated, aggravated
to the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then i'm have to take it


and then after takin' that, i'mma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
it's gon' say "the whole rap game passed away" on top of the affidavit
graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
to michael jackson's activator (woo!)
meanin' i'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up data
rolling over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
homie, they're sick, you can normally ask a hater
don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
drop in the lap of a tax evader (homie, they spent)


now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
what, girl, i'm the crack-a-lator
percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later
tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
you're rollin' with a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're...


livin' life in the fast lane
movin' at the speed of life and i can't slow down
only got a gallon in the gas tank
but i'm almost at the finish line, so i can't stop now

i don't really know where i'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
gon' roll 'til i drop and ride 'til i die
i'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

pedal to the metal
pedal to the metal

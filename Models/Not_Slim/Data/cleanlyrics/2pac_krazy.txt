throw me a cigarette, dawg! 
they got me feelin' crazier than a motherfucker
i got bad azz in this motherfucker
makaveli the don, representin' the outlawz
bad azz representin' the lbc crew
so what'cha wanna do? y'know how we do it


puffin' on lye, hopin' that it gets me high
got a nigga goin' crazy
oh yeah, i feel crazy


time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a nigga goin' crazy
oh yeah, i feel crazy

(tell 'em about it!)


last year was a hard one, but life goes on
hold my head against the wall, learnin' right from wrong
they say my ghetto instrumental, detrimental to kids
as if they can't see the misery in which they live
blame me for the outcome, ban my records  check it
don't have to bump this, but please respect it
i took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
turned into a plus, now they stuck livin' blinded
hennessy got me feelin' bad, time to stop drinkin'
rollin' in my drop-top jag, what's that cops thinkin'?
sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
i came a long way, but still i got so far to go
dear mama, don't worry; i'ma watch for snakes
tell setchu that i love her, but it's hard today
i got the letter that she sent me, and i cried for weeks
this what came out when i tried to speak  all i heard was


time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a nigga going' crazy
i feel crazy
time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a nigga goin' crazy
i feel crazy

(one, two, three, four)


i see bloods and crips runnin' up the hill
lookin' for a better way
my brothers and sisters, it's time to bail
'cause even thug niggas pray
hopin' god hear me, i entered the game
look how much i changed
i'm no longer innocent  casualties of fame
made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
and i swear i seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
when i gave her the keys to her own house, this your land
your only son done became a man
watchin' time fly, i love my people, do or die
but i wonder why we scared to let each other fly
june one-six, 'seven-one, the day
mama pushed me out her womb, told me, "nigga, get paid!"
no one can understand me  the black sheep
outcasted from my family, now packin' heat
i run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
when he died, i could hear him say (thug life, baby!)


time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a nigga goin' crazy
i feel crazy
time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a nigga goin' crazy
crazy
crazy
crazy
i feel crazy (crazy)


god, help me out here, 'cause i'm possessed
i need the root of all evil for my stress
'cause money's like a strong prescription drug
it's got me addicted to the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
somethin' about the paper with the pictures of the president's head, damn, it's like a motherfuckin' plague that spread
it's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
i keep my head on straight, makin' money 'cause it's cursed
makin' money makes a difference day by day
so i gotta stay paid, no doubt, day in and day out
this life is like a vicious cycle called fightin' to live
no matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
a lot of my peers didn't make it to the years to come
did life doin' right or did life livin' dumb
who has the answers? i wonder; i turn to my elders
they aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
(why?) 'cause they don't even know
a million things run through my mind (through my mind)
you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time
(you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time)


time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a nigga goin' crazy
i feel crazy
time goes by, puffin' on lye
hopin' that it gets me high
got a nigga goin' crazy


i feel fucked up in this bitch
i smoked half a ounce to the head. chocolate thai, indo, hawaiian, lambsbread, buddha  all that shit!
i'm fucked up in this motherfucker
and hennessy don't help
and hennessy don't help
thug passion in this muh'fucker
makaveli the don puttin' it down to the fullest
maximum overload
three day theory  killuminati to your body
with the impact of a twelve gauge shotty
double-i slugs, no love, straight thugs

one time for my niggas in the jail cell, (one time for my niggas locked up)
one time for my niggas doin' life in hell, (one time for my niggas and shit, one time)
one time for my niggas in the jail cell (one time)
one time for my niggas doin' life in hell (one time for my niggas locked down)
one time for my niggas on the death row
(one time for my niggas on the row)
for my niggas on death row
one time for my niggas livin' broke (westside, california style, la!)
one time for my niggas livin' broke (you know what time it is, no doubt)
one time for my niggas in the jail cell (get high, puffin' on lye)
wonder if it get me high, yeah

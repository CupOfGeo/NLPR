a nigga so goddamn stressed out
i feel like fuck everything right now
see i've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
but i'll be damned if i give 'em a handout
see my pride is one thing i will not put aside
i'm too proud to beg, i'm sorry left eye
if i don't make it in life, motherfucker i tried
what? uh


you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
nobody, nobody but you
so it feels like, like it's only you


so i'm feeling like i want to, i want to
i want to, i want to go so far from here
very, very far from here
i need to, i need to
i need to, i need to go so far from here
very, very far from here


it seems like, you can't win for losing
whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
sitting pursuing, but your time will soon come
nobody knows the position that you in
but it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
that feeling, hard to explain
when you just, just want to get away
something like






away from it all
take me out of hell where only heaven can visit
the smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
i'm stuck on the studio couch, now i'm thinking bout my daughter
times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
just press record or, seems like i need a mill' to keep my shit in order
instead of problem solving
from my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
as i fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
nothing is surrounding me, living my life
though it's better to write
configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
so how you feel? my nigga, i keep it real
a schoolboy soon to be star, mr. lamar

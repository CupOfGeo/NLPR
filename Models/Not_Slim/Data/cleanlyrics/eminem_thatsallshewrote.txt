now i don't really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
these bitches knew as soon as they saw me
it's never me to get the privilege to know
i roll like a desperado
now i never know where i'm gonna go
still i ball like there's no tomorrow
until it's over and it's all she wrote

you're staring straight into a barrel of hate terrible fate
not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
cupid shot his arrow and missed
wait sarah you're late, your train left
mascara and eggs smeared on your face
night's over goodbye, hoe
i thought that i told you that spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
never shoulda came within range of my rover
shoulda known i was trouble soon as i rolled up
any chick who's dumb enough after i blind-fold her
to still come back to the crib
must want me to mess with her mind
hold up
she mistook me for some high roller
well i won't buy her soda unless it's rock &amp; rye cola
(faygo's cheaper)
buy you a bag of fritos i wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
if you was bleach and i was hair i wouldn't dye/die for you
tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
you get your eyes swoll' up i'm on my straight grizzly
so why would i buy you a gay-ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar

now i don't really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
these bitches knew as soon as they saw me
it's never me to get the privilege to know
i roll like a desperado
now i never know where i'm gonna go
still i ball like there's no tomorrow

tip told me on this hoe tip
best tip i could give you to hip you
is never to let these tricks trick you
mighty ambiguous of you to think i love you slut, shit
dig you ho
take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
if i should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
like double stick, it's you, but fuck it tip, it's cool
i'm chilling like a villain
like the penguin in its fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
i'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
'fore i tie a fucking knot i'd tie you in one bitch
you think this is some nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
i'll give you some lumps before i split some lump sums with you
so here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger
but a nickel might just get you one pickle
fuck it, it's official so blow the whistle i got a trust issue
there's a bombshell, scud missile
like i just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
like before i rapped i was a motherfucking stud
slut, this'll teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way for shizzle
i still live like i budget a gilbert's lodge check stub, bizzle
so fuck sizzler. this check is a bust like a blood blister

now i don't really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
these bitches knew as soon as they saw me
it's never me to get the privilege to know
i roll like a desperado
now i never know where i'm gonna go
still i ball like there's no tomorrow
until it's over and it's all she wrote

yeah i guess life is a bitch ain't it tip
and each one thinks they the shit
shirt off my back i wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
i'm giving these hoes a dose of their own medicine
let 'em get a good taste of it
i'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
but in case you didn't, ill stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
life is too short and i got no time to sit around just wasting it
so i pace this shit a little bit quicker
that clock i'm racing it
double timing it, but i still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
that it may take you pricks to catch on
while you strong arm like stretch armstrong
man i still say k-mart's like there's an apostrophe "s" on it dog
and they say mcdonald's isn't a restaurant well i guess i'm wrong
but if you gonna tell me that a&amp;w ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "f" on dawg

now i don't really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
these bitches knew as soon as they saw me
it's never me to get the privilege to know
i roll like a desperado
now i never know where i'm gonna go
still i ball like there's no tomorrow
until it's over and it's all she wrote

all she wrote, all she wrote
i said it's over and that's all she wrote
all she wrote, all she wrote
goodnight, it's over
and that's all she wrote

good evening.

i'm reporting live from sunset boulevard where many excited fans have gathered with candles  awaiting the much anticipated release, of twopac shakur's latest album, better dayz.
this is yet another post-humous release by twopac which, raises the question 
"where are these songs coming from?" 
it's interesting how the message in these songs is still relevant today.
even in his death he's touching people with his lyrics.
i can feel the energy in the air as they count down to midnight when the album will officially be released.
oh, hold on. i think they're starting to countdown now.


five, four, three, two, one.

i'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
so come and get some of this thug passion, baby


mayne! i could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant
but i'm a straight soldier, i'll roll up a nigga like it's heaven sent
trippin' over dead presidents
they got these derelicts
i throw was down with this business, tryin' to clown and get a cent
and so rather, than stand forever
been thinkin' drinkin' over a felony
and hell of me
and how it will be in hella shit, people tellin' me to cool out
but they ain't feelin' me, a motherfuckin' fool, about
my fuckin' cheddar cheese
and it pleases, passion of mine
thuggin', huggin' plenty of g's and laughin' while i pass through times
and all these bastards be watchin' just keep it plain
i'ma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
i can, pinkle with the rain twinklin'
diamonds and things go blinkin'
enough to hold me, 'til i'm, old and wrinklin'
and these adversaries
they gonna have to be worryin'
cause i'ma be illin', fulfillin' my passion
'til i'm buryin' my thug passion


i heard it's the bomb

now what if me
turn this hennessy into a robbery
the prophecy probably suddenly switch and how it supposed to be
and dirty money
can't be evil cause it's fillin' up my tummy
born in a position, death collision was futuristic
twistin' riches, but there is only one way to make more
so i'm standin' on the corner tryin' to hustle in the snow
and my bigger bro, couldn't know
but buy a .forty-four, blastin' at playa haters wantin' more
with a thug passion


puttin' down mashin', control by this thug's passion
unlike them other bustas pistol blastin'
i'm askin', what happened
to the niggas who kept it real like they claim to
that's what money and fame do, see they ain't true
travelin' this road my poor soul has been consolidated
with all this bullshit that i done tolerated
how i made it, can be easily stated
it's like my hardest bring the grip with the passion, left me to fuckin' greatest
load up and take shit


make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split


creep with me, through that immortal flow
thug passion got you tremblin' like death on the row
make your move, so i can throw your mind a curve
while i'll be blowin' up the scene, like my nigga mr. herb
take a toke, as your heart goes full arrest
i got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
you need a dub to get you flowin'
and let that loc see smoke
feelin' the strokes of the nine squeeze tight and slow


i heard it's the bomb
and you got it goin' on
give me some of your thug passion, baby
you got me drippin' wet
from the way you make me sweat
give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow!

they say money don't make the man
but damn, i'm makin' money
observin' you motherfuckers, 'cause some of you bitches funny
say you want it but you bullshittin'
lickin' them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
sippin' on some aliz and cristal, meanwhile
buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me, she smiles; a niggas full of passion
satisfaction is everlastin'
"how does it feel?" what i'm askin'
while i'm rubbin' on that ass "why you laughin'?"
see, i'm diggin' as if i'm curious
full blown and furious
baby, get a grip, when i be doin' this
it's so physical my attraction
driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction
baby i'm born to ball
thugged out on death row

now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion

complexion (two-step)
complexion don't mean a thing (it's a zulu love)
complexion (two-step)
it all feels the same (it's a zulu love)

dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
give a fuck about your complexion, i know what the germans done
sneak (dissin)
sneak me through the back window, im a good field nigga
i made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
you know i'd go the distance, you know i'm ten toes down
even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention



dark as the midnight hour, i'm bright as the mornin' sun
brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
sneak (dissin')
sneak me through the back window, im a good field nigga
i made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
you know i'd go the distance, you know i'm ten toes down
even if master's listenin', i got the world's attention
so i'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
beauty is what you make it, i used to be so mistaken
by different shades of faces
then wit told me, "you're womanless, woman love the creation"
it all came from god then you was my confirmation
i came to where you reside
and looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
let the willie lynch theory reverse a million times with...



you like it, i love it
you like it, i love it


let me talk my stu scott, scuse me on my twopac
keep your head up, when did you stop? love and die
color of your skin, color of your eyes
thats the real blues, baby, like you met jays baby
you blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey
all my solomon up north, twelve years a slave
twelve years of age, thinkin my shade too dark
i love myself, i no longer need cupid
and forcin my dark side like a young george lucas
light dont mean you smart, bein dark dont make you stupid
and frame of mind for them bustas, aint talkin woohah!
need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored
like two ties, l-l, you lose two times
if you dont see you beautiful in your complexion
it aint complex to put it in context
find the air beneath the kite, thats the context
yeah, baby, im conscious, aint no contest
if you like it, i love it, all your earth tones been blessed
aint no stress, jigga boos wanna be
i aint talkin jay, i aint talkin bey
im talkin days we got school watchin movie screens
and spike yourself esteem
the new james bond gon be black as me
black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
and its all beautiful to me
call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
we all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors aint a thing

barefoot babies with no cares
teenage gun toters that dont play fair, should i get out the car?
i dont see compton, i see something much worse
the land of the landmines, the hell thats on earth

(what y'all want?)
unconditional love (no doubt)
talking bout the stuff that don't wear off
it don't fade
it'll last for all these crazy days
these crazy nights
whether you wrong or you right
i'm a still love you
still feel you
still there for you
no matter what (hehe)
you will always be in my heart
with unconditional love

come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
all my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
how many caskets can we witness
before we see it's hard to live this life without god, so we must ask forgiveness
ask mama why i got this urge to die
witness the tears falling free from my eyes, before she could reply
though we were born without a silver spoon
my broken down tv, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
one day i hope to make it, a player in this game
mama don't cry, long as we try, maybe things change
perhaps it's just a fantasy
a life where we don't need no welfare and share with our whole family
maybe it's me that caused it, the fighting and the hurtin'
in my room crying cause i didn't want to be a burden
watch mama open up her arms to hug me
and i ain't worried bout a damn thang, with unconditional love

in this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
though things change, the future's still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love


just got the message you've been calling all week
been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
but you know, with you and me it's on g
we could never be enemies
cause you been such a good friend to me
where would i be without my dogs
no wonder why when times get hard
cause it ain't easy being who we are
driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
so i proceed to make gs, eternally in my mission
is to be more than just a rap musician
the elevation of today's generation, if could make 'em listen
prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
when we make something out of nothing
no pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good
if they could cut out all the busting
the liquor and the weed the cussing
sending love out to my block
the struggle never stops (unconditional love)

in this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
though things change, the future's still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love


i'll probably never understand ya ways
with everyday i swear i hear ya
trying to change your ways while getting paid at the same time
just had a baby with the same eyes
something inside, please let me die these are strange times
how come i never made it
maybe it's the way i played it in my heart
i knew one day i gotta be a star
my hopes and all my wishes
so many vivid pictures, and all the currency
i'll never even get to see
this fast life soon shatters
cause after all the lights and screams
nothing but my dreams matter
hoping for better days
maybe a peaceful night, baby don't cry
cause everything gonna be alright
just lay your head on my shoulder
don't worry bout a thing, baby
girl i'm a soldier (huh)
never treated me bad, no matter who i was
you still came with that, unconditional love


in this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
though things change, the future's still inside of me
we must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
so you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

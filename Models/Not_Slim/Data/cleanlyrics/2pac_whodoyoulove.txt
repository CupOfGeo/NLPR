maybe it's the thug in me



ever since i was a young scrub
i was a thug on the corner with my niggas slangin drugs
and running from the narcs when they pass by, don't ask why
i'm a hustler, till my ass die
even if i do come up, i'll be ready when they run up, huh
i'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh
i never trust these hoes at all
fuckin' with them tramp-ass sluts you supposed to fall
said she played you for your money but the shit was cool
guess it's true, niggas be bitches too
you can't see how she worked you, all up in the skirt
now you looking like a jerk cause she hurt you
now head's up, don't be a playa hater, just peep game
keep your mind on your money watch the bitch change
see hoes love thugs, and thugs love loot
hand it over motherfucker 'fore i shoot - who do you love?

maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
tell me who do you love?
maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
who do you love?
maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
tell me who do you love?
maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me


i'm living that, thug life baby!
steady smoking indo, going crazy
baby come and hug me when you rub me, turn the lights down
we in the dark, do you love me?
everybody's talking 'bout they, know me
but they ain't down like my motherfuckin' homies
tell me what you need when you, see me
and we can get it on, beotch, take it easy
don't try to hold me, control me
but you can take my number baby call me when you lonely
cause it's a man's world, ain't no need to ask why
i'm high 'til i die, and strapped with my fo'-five
cause you can lose it in the gutter
i wonder if i'll die by the hands of another broke motherfucker
they call me the alcoholer, i'm all in
thug for life nigga balling
i'm getting tired of these hoes trying to play me
you can't fade me and my niggas going crazy
all day long i'm straight thuggin, and constantly mean muggin
breakin' the bitches that be bugging tell me who do you love?

maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
tell me who do you love?
maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
who do you love?
maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
tell me who do you love?
maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
who do you love?

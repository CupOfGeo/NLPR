late night coolin' with my homies
drinkin' hennessey an' cold brew
after smokin' stopped in oakland
got the munchies for some soul food
so we stopped to get a bite to eat
at the local barbeque
it's just another borin' monday
an' there's nothin' else to do
now as we stepped out of the car i
heard someone behind me fighting
so i turned to look and find out
what's the cause of this excitement
one brother was a dopefiend
and the other was a dopeman
and the dopeman had a ak
said he'll spray an' he's not jokin'
well it seems to be the dopefiend
owed the dopeman for his product
and he swore if he did not pay
he would end up gettin' shot up
now i could not walk away
'cause i got caught up in the scene
wonderin' what would happen
to this poor and helpless fiend
well my homie michael cooley
said let's go and make our order
what's the use in watchin' two men
stand out here fight over quarters
well i walked inside the diner
and all the dopefiends waved to me
heard the sound of several gunshots
and i ran outside to see


(what's goin' on)
another gunshot rings
(what's goin' on)
another siren screams
(what's goin' on)
another mother cries
(what's goin' on)
'cause another innocent dies
(what' goin' on)


all the people in the diner
ran outside to see the big show
it was just another party
for them to see just who they would know
but for me i held concern
i wanted to go see the outcome
would a mother have a son tonight
or would she live her life without one
i made it to the streets i
almost cried right on the spot
not only had the fiend died
but a small girl had been shot
my heart could take no more
i felt a tear roll down my face
that was daddy's bullet
but she took it in his place


(what's goin' on)
another gunshot rings
(what's goin' on)
another siren screams
(what's goin' on)
another mother cries
(what's goin' on)
'cause another innocent dies
(what' goin' on)


tried to make way through the crowd
so i could go help the baby
she could barely speak but she whispered
"mister can you please save me? "
so i screamed out "someone help me! "
but i don't think they could hear
and if they did they didn't care
oh how i hated everyone there
the baby lie here dyin'
and i wondered what could i do
the cameraman and newspapers
had come to get their interviews
to them it's just story
and they can't see the tragedy
to them it doesn't matter
'cause hey it wasn't their family
i don't think i'll be back
'cause it'll never be the same here
so i wipe away the tears
and leave the scene the way i came here
though some people say it's crazy
and the food could have been finer
i'll never forget
never forget the night at dopefiend's diner


(what's goin' on)
another gunshot rings
(what's goin' on)
another siren screams
(what's goin' on)
another mother cries
(what's goin' on)
'cause another innocent dies
(what' goin' on)

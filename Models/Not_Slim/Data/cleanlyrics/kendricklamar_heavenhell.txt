"my nigga, what it look like?"


niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying
bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
genosism, criticism, unemployment, racism
burning buildings, aids victims, cancer killing, no cure
oil spilling, turmoil, poverty-stricken
police brutality kicking ass of us africans, hostages in afghanistan
not to mention another prison, child molesting
cow intestines, botox injection, earthquakes that's government testing
secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
that turn to crack, then invest it amongst us blacks, just a method
to hold us back, great depression, amongst iraq no direction
no google map, just a tec for the soowoo
swerving isuzu, then blah-blah-blah, adolescents go cuckoo
mothers are boo-boo crying, the governor keep us starving
these commercials keep us buying these cigarettes
supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph, distinctive living with science
no place to live in, no zion, see that's forbidden, we frying

"my nigga, what it look like?"
that's exactly what hell look like, uh


tell it like it is, nigga
tell it like it is, homeboy
tell it like it is, nigga
tell it like it is, tell 'em what's up

"my nigga, what it look like?"


malcolm laughing, martin laughing, biggie spitting
'pac is rapping, gregory capping, people singing, bells is ringing
children playing, angels praying, fourteen carat golden streets
cali greens, red wine, potato yams, turkey legs
calling every human being...

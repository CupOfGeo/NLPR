'emember
more than an adversary, i'm very quick
i'm ready to hit 'em with this gift, i'm equipped to kick
so, grab your coat and your hat, cause i'm prepared to clown
let's carry this end that throw these motherfuckers down
oh shit, twopacalypse is back and strapped
attackin' the packs, i'm kickin' the facts for stacks to rap
and those that max, relax and let the blacks get jacks
i'm gettin' taxed, my packs is packed with angry blacks
i'm ready to go
i'm rippin' the shows, hittin' the dough
gettin' the hoes, clothes
pumpin' the flow, thanks to the hump
cause the nose knows
check the pose, froze, when you see me close
punks you gonna roast, host in a cloud of smoke
broke, choked on some potent dank smoke
wrote, rhymes that'll bring me bank notes
nope, i ain't the type of fella that you're used to
ki-ki-ki-kickin' the funky flava
pumpin' the deuce with no producers
run for cover when you hear the bass drum
one verse is all it takes

ladies and gentleman, introducing the new and improved you know who

never been the type to bend or budge
the wrong button to push

all this peace talk can cease
all these people i had to leave in limbo
i'm back now
i've come to release this info
i'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
can-i-bitch don't want no beef with slim?

and square dance with me!

let your hair down to the track
yeah kick on back

the boogie monster of rap
yeah the man's back
with a plan to ambush this bush administration
mush the senate's face and push this generation
of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like
this white hot light
that i'm under

i look so sunburnt
oh no

yeah you laugh 'til your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted
while you're at band camp thinkin' that crap can't happen
till you fuck around
get an anthrax napkin
inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrapping
open the plastic and then you stand back gasping
fuckin' assassins hi-jackin' amtraks crashing
all this terror america demands action
next thing you know you've got uncle sam's ass askin'
to join the army or what you'll do for their navy
you just a baby
gettin' recruited at eighteen
you're on a plane now
eating their food and their baked beans
i'm twenty-eight

my views ain't changed still inhumane

if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song

now i've got task on a nigga's ass
tell me will they blast me
i think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
it's gettin crazy after dark,
these narcs be like trying to shut me down but i'm too smart
now picture me scared of the penitentiary
i've been moving these things since the days of elementary
now tell me what ya need when ya see me
i'm stacking gs buying all the things on tv, believe me
i got some killers on my payroll and they know
when it's time to handle business nigga lay low
although i'm young i'm still coming up
i'm gettin paid pulling razors on niggas when they running up
the first to pull the strap when there's drama
buster you ain't heard?i been slicing motherfuckers since i lost my mama
there ain't a cop that can stop me
my posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me
i'm loyal to the game


if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn

a nigga never been as broke as me, i like that
when i was young i had two pair of lees, besides that
the pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
the one i wore on mondays and wednesdays
while niggas flirt, i'm sewing tigers on my shirtand alligators
ya wanna see the inside, huh, i see ya later
here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga wit the fake, blaow!
why you punch me in my face, stay in ya place
play ya position, here come my intuition
go in this nigga pocket
rob him while his friends watchin
that hoes clockin, here comes respect
his crew's your crew, or they might be next
look at they man eye, big man they never try
so we roll wid em, stole wid em
i mean loyalty, niggaz bought me milks at lunch
the milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch.

if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song

if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song

if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song

if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song

 
hold up is that you?
with them big ol' thighs after school
j-three hundred and five had gave me high five when i said i'm in hot pursuit

you said i won't ride until kendrick drive a new monte carlo that cruise
and that shot my pride, i tried to improv, but no freestyle, i never do
ya lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti'
ya overlookin' every nigga that ain't quite ready
to make it rain on ya like i'm boutta break a levee (hol up!)
that pussy petty
yeah ya nails did, ya hair did, your cellphone is selfish
it only got numbers that come with a hummer her new prima donna i smelt it
tried to make ya mine.. (ho)
tried to make some time.. (ho)
but i ain't got the time or the patience to stop and wait in line.. (ho)
her dream soap versace, she fall for armani
i only deal with rich niggas, fuck you and mitt romney
i'm grown now, i'm on my own now, i'm poppin'
change my phone now, when i get home now, i got options
fast forward, wait is that you?
with them big ol' thighs after school?
and your three kids and three baby daddies same car note that's overdue?
i know


but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing...

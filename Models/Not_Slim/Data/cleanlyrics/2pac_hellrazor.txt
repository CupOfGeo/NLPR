i ain't never touched a gat that i couldn't shoot
i learned not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes
taught lessons, a young nigga askin' questions
while other suckers was guessin', i was gangsta sexin'
elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
i'm headed for the penitentiary and cuttin' classing
i'm buckin blastin, straight mashin
mobbin through the overpass laughin
while these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
they jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me lord

cause some nigga tried to kill me
and mama raised a hellraiser, everyday gettin paid

and even in the darkest nights, i'm a thug for life

mama raised a hellraiser why cry
that's just life in the ghetto, do or die

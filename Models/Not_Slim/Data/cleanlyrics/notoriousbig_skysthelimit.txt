good evenin ladies and gentlemen
how's everybody doin tonite?
i'd like to welcome to the stage, the lyrically acclaimed, ha
i like this young man, because, when he came out
he came out wit the phrase, he went from ashy to classy
ha, i like that
so everybody in the house, give a warm, round of applause for
the notorious b.i.g. *clapping*
the notorious b.i.g. ladies and gentlemen give it up for him ya'll

uhhh
a nigga never been as broke as me, i like that
when i was young i had two pair of lees, besides that
the pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
the one i wore on mondays and wednesdays
while niggas flirt, i'm sewing tigers on my shirt
and alligators
ya wanna see the inside, huh, i see ya later
here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga wit the fake, blaow!
why you punch me in my face, stay in ya place
play ya position, here come my intuition
go in this nigga pocket
rob him while his friends watchin
that hoes clockin, here comes respect
his crew's your crew, or they might be next
look at they man eye, big man they never try
so we roll wid em, stole wid em
i mean loyalty, niggaz bought me milks at lunch
the milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch
in here, eyes crossed from blue and white dust
pass the blunt


sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
just keep on pressin on
sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, pressin what you want
sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
just keep on pressin on
sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, be what you want, have what you want, be what you want


uh-huh, i was a shame, my crew was lame
i have enough heart for most of em
long as i got stuff from most of em
it's on, even when i was wrong i got my point across
they depicted me the boss, of course
my orange box-cutter make the world go round
plus i'm fuckin, bitches ain't my homegirls now
start stackin, dabbled in crack, gun packin
nickname medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
from gym class, to englass, pass off a global
the only nigga wit a mobile, can't you see like total
gettin larger in waist and taste
ain't no tellin where this felon is headin, just in case
keep a shell at the tip of ya melon, clear da space
ya brain was a terrible thing ta waste
eighty-eight long gates, snatch initial name plates
smokin spliffs wit niggaz, real life beginner killers
prayin god forgive us for being sinners, help us out


sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
just keep on pressin on
sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, pressin what you want
sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
just keep on pressin on
sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, be what you want, have what you want, be what you want


after realizin, to master enterprisin
i ain't have ta be in school by ten, i was in
began to encounter, wit my counter-parts
i holla burn the block apart, break it down into sections
drugs by the selection
some use pipes, others use in-jec-tions
syringe sold seperately, frank the deputy
quick to grab my smith-n-wessun, like my dick was missin
to protect my position, my corner, my layer
while we out here, say the hustlas prayer
if the game shakes me or breaks me
i hope it makes me a better man
take a better stand
put money in my moms hand
get my daughter this college plan, so she don't need no man
stay far from timid
only make moves when ya heart's in it
and live the phrase sky's the limit
motherfucker... see you chumps on top


sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
just keep on pressin on
sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, be what you want
sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
just keep on pressin on
sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, pressin what you want
sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
just keep on pressin on
sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, be what you want
sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
just keep on pressin on
sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, be what you want
...
sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
just keep on pressin on
sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, be what you want...

-live and he's flowing like the mystic river

-peared i was hiding in freeway's beard, just a
hop skip and a jump from my skin, gushing
nails into my face that i been pushing
hell-raiser, my face is my pincushion
it's like when i'm on the mic, i can squish a
sucker like a vice-grip, my pen put ya
in the slaughterhouse cause ya styles been butchered
i'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on
my brain's on hyperdrive someone put the brakes on

and no one stopping how i getting it,
and hind sight should never left when i was living,
and probably wouldn't be getting pressed by all these women,
and then again, i wouldn't rap the ones i was diggin'
so annihilate the looking, and talking alot about the hood; kim'n, kim'n,
uh, so selena williams, just like my dad talks about more john dick'n,

and never trust her, no shit! even she specialize in massaging on my testicles, 
and i never trust her, a whole lot, even on the first date, she basically get her mouth rimmed,
and turn around and ask me for a kiss, no bitch i'm straight, 
and i never really get concerned how my own dick tastes,

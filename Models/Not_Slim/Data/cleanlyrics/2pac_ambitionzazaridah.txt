i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah
you don't wanna fuck with me
got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g
let's get ready to rumble!

now, you know how we do it, like a g
what really go on in the mind of a nigga
that get down for theirs
constantly, money over bitches
not bitches over money
stay on your grind, nigga
my ambitions as a ridah
my ambitions as a ridah

so many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
this life as a rap star is nothing without guard
was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public
my attitude was "fuck it," because motherfuckers love it
to be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
to catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
then i spit some game in her ear, "go to the telly, hoe!"
equipped with money in a benz 'cause, bitch, i'm barely broke
i'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feeling crucial
from player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
from hustlin' and prayers
to breaking motherfuckers to pay up
i got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
i'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so i'm wishin'
competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'
i'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
no guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
now it's on and it's on because i said so
can't trust a bitch in the business so i got with death row
now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
but thug niggas be on point and game tight
me, syke and bogart strapped up the same night
got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
these niggas is jealous
'cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya
hopin' you listen, i catch you payin' attention
to my ambitions as a ridah

i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah
you don't wanna fuck with me
got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g
let's get ready to rumble

peep it, it was my only wish to rise
above these jealous coward motherfuckers i despise
when it's time to ride
i was the first off this side, give me the nine
i'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
that's what they screaming as they drill me
but i'm hard to kill (that's all you niggas got?)
so open fire, i see you kill me, witness my steel
spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
i'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
mama, come rescue me, i'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
i'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when i'm caught
(shoot!) fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrificin'
won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga tyson
thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
when it's time to die, to be a man
and pick the way you leave
fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah
you don't wanna fuck with me
got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g
let's get ready to rumble

my murderous lyrics
equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
pay off the block, evade the cops
'cause i know they coming for me
i been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
now i'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
question my methods to switch up speeds
sure as some bitches bleed
niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
blast me, but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
didn't diminish my powers
so now i'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards
that's why they tried to set me up
had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed they wet me up
but i'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
at the time i contemplate the way that god made it
lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
for money i'll have these motherfuckers buried
i been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
knowin' when i get out, they gon' feel it
witness the realest! a hoo-ridah when i put the shit inside
the cry from all your people when they find her
just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
revenge on them niggas that played me
and all the cowards that was down with it
now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah
you don't wanna fuck with me
got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g
let's get ready to rumble

wassup, boo? yeah
hahahaha, yeah

 
another shady mission
tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision
tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
if i have kids, will i live to see them grow?
though i don't know
i live the life of a thug nigga until the day i go
no broken promises, a sacred bond broken
i know i die alone, but yet and still i'm hopin'
visions of prisons, maybe i'll be forgiven
i know it's better in heaven, 'cause being here ain't livin'
close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy
still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
maybe i'll be the one or just maybe i'm lost
you'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right


i wanna be the one who
who you can depend on who
who be the one who be there 
through the thick and thin 
go by the water we will
be there 'til the morning
we won't leave until the night
and we will be forever more

 
no one else can do what you do for me
take me away from the pain i feel inside
and it's gonna be alright and it'll be ok
if we try and take our time 
yes, baby, take our time
and we'll grow, trust i know
i wanna be the one who


i wanna be the one who
who you can depend on who
who be the one who be there
through the thick and thin
go by the water we will
be there 'til the morning
we won't leave until the night
and we will be forever more


you got to play your cards right on one (oh, yeah)
can't be rushing like it's a race, nomsayin'? (no, no, no)
if you be patient, and you take your time (be patient, baby)
and you finesse it, nine times out of ten times (ten)
homeboy, you gon' wake up with your breakfast in bed
but if you rush and you just be manhandlin'
ha-ha (hey, it takes a real man)
your ass is going home tonight, ha-ha (hey)
play your cards right, nigga, take your time (be the one)
be patient (be the one, hey)

ha-ha, play your cards right (be the one, i wanna be the one)


i wanna be the one who
who you can depend on who
who be the one who be there
through the thick and thin

get some champagne (ha-ha, be forever more)

niggas out there jealous cause we be bailin' with death row
they try to playa hate, but they can't fade us though
we be mobbin' through the neighborhood, yeah
with that funky sound, so funky
we be throwin' down
(this goes out to you playa)
(you know, you know who you are)


gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
so when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
so when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
so when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me


are you confused?
you wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside the shoes of a nigga who don't have a thing to lose
when me and you was homies
no one informed me it was all a scheme
you infiltrated my team and sold a nigga's dreams
how could you do me like that?
i took ya family in
i put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again
and now you let the fear put your ass in a place
complicated to escape, it's a fool's fate
without your word you're a shell of a man
i lost respect for ya, nigga
we can never be friends
i know i'm runnin' through your head now
what could you do?
if it was up to you, i'd be dead now
i let the world know, nigga, you a coward
ya could never be live
until you die
see the motherfuckin' bitch in your eye
type of nigga, that let the evil of the money trap me
when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me (holla at me)


(gotta be afraid, dont let the evil of the money trap me)
(so when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay
(so i gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me)
(so when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay


curious, spittin' lyrics on the verge of furious
i'm addicted to currency
nigga that's why we're doin' this
i got shot up, i surprised the niggas the way i got up
and then i hit the studio, it's time to blow the block up
no hesitation
this information got you contemplatin'
heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
break him and let him see the face of a mental patient
it's a celebration of my criminal elevation, more participation
i want members that call the fifty states
to keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
will i be great, is it my fate?
to live the life of luxury, some niggas bought my tapes
so much jealousy it scares me
so be prepared, cause only the strong survive
life isn't fair (fair)
probably never knew the way it feels to die
so you see come fuck with me, i give that ass a try!
nigga, holla at me


(gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me)
(so when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay
(and now i gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me)
(so when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay


i should've saw the signs, i was blinded
criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
so many brothas framed in this dirty game
it's a shame, so much pressure on my brain while she blame me
secrets in the dark, only her and i know
now i'm sittin' in the state pen', doin' time slow
guess she made a bad decision
that got me livin' just like an animal
i'm caged up in state prison
my niggas dissin' cause hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn
a cemetery full of motherfuckers not knowin'
picture my prophecy i got some attacking me, on top of me
i'm runnin' from the coppers, but never let 'em stop me
cause i'm a soldier
hell, ever since i was a little nigga havin' fantasies of one day getting older
niggas is paranoid, trust; a no no
love is a mystery, fuck the po po
holla at me


(so when you see me nigga)
(you better holla at me)
you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay
(gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me)
(so when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay
(a nigga gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me)
(so when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
you better beware where you lay
we better not find where you stay

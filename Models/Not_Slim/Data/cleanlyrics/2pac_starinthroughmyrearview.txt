staring at the world through my rearview
just looking back at the world from another level
ya know what i mean? starin'


multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
niggas is calling cops, people shot, nobody stops
i wonder when the world stopped caring
last night two kids shot while the whole block staring
i will never understand this society
first they try to murder me then they lie to me
product of a dying breed
all my homies trying weed
now the little baby's crazed raised off hennessy
tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
listen, through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
and we turning bad boys to grown men, it's on again
i give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
one love from a thug nigga
rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
to the end, my friend
i'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
while i'm staring at the world through my rearview
see, i'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
while i'm staring at the world through my rearview
they got me


staring at the world through my rearview
go on, baby, scream to god, he can't hear you
i can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
getting high, watching time fly
and all my motherfuckers


now you see him, now you don't
some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
what happened to 'em?
well, let's see, it seems to be a mystery
but all i know i never let the money get to me
stay down like the truest
thug life until i check out this bitch, i thought you knew this
who is gonna catch me when i fall or even care to?
while you thinking i see you lost up in my rearview
hear you is down with them outlawz
outcast, left far, i'm through like southpaws
but still we keep mashing till our dreams come through
staring at the world through my rearview


now i was raised as a young black male
in order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
in the cell, counting days in this living black hell
do you feel me? keys to ignition, use at your discretion
roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
niggas hate me in the section from years of chin-checking
turn to smith and wesson war weapons
heavenly father, i'm a soldier
i'm getting hotter cause the world's getting colder
baby, let me hold ya
talk to my guns like they fly bitches
all you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!


now i know the answers to the question
"do dreams come true?"
still staring at the world through my rearview
i said now i know the answers, "do dreams come true?"
staring at the world through my rearview

nigga kadafi say..


back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
nine-six for glocks
cause fiends hitting up blocks with street sweepers
bless myself when knowing rules to these streets
something i learned in school
on some million man march shit for the piece/peace
true that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
criminally addicted, infested since a seed
we all die, breed bleed like humans
towns run by young guns, outlawz and truants
shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when i go
burnt my body with my shotty, or chosing my dough
so while you reminiscing all nights out with the crew
smoke a blunt for me too, i'm staring through your rearview


hahahaha, you ain't knowing what we mean by staring through the rearview, so since you ain't knowing what we mean let me break down understanding
the world the world is behind us
once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
and what the levels and the rules of the game is, then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played
so now we looking at the world, from like, behind us
niggas know what we gotta do
just gotta put our mind to it and do it
it's all about the papers, money rule the world
bitches make the world go round
real niggas do they wanna do, bitch niggas do what they can


staring at the world through my rearview
go on, baby, scream to god, he can't hear you
i can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
getting high, watching time fly
and all my motherfuckers

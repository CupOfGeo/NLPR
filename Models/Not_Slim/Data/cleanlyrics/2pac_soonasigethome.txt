dear baby, it's me again, stuck inside this max pen
tryna pay my debt for all my sins
see, these penitentiary times be so heavy on my mind
at times it's like i'm living just to die
i'm living in hell, stuck in my jail cell
stranded in the county jail, waiting for my chance to post bail
i wanna be paid in large stacks and mash in fast jags
i blast and wonder "how long will i last?"
my memories fade when i'm intoxicated
busters are shady, so i'm dumping on cowards
crazy whenever faded
i know i said it all before, but now i mean it
visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear i seen it
even though you mad at me
you'll be glad to see the strategy
of making these chips come so easily
i max out in the morning, baby, life is good
me and you against the whole hood, soon as i get home


grab my straps, locate my comrades
let's get my enemies not knowing i'm coming back
soon as i get home
go get the money out the safe
it's time to turn the streets into a war zone
soon as i come home


sittin' here looking at pictures of me and you livin'
but now you out in the world, while i'm twistin' in prison
love letters come daily, words of affection
you send me money and nude pictures beggin' for some sexin'
stay wide open, keep your eyes peeled
and my advice is "keep it real or you can die squealin'."
plus i never had to worry 'bout a visit
cause you're there daily
guards tryna get your number, you don't dare tell me
tongue-kissing, steady humpin', tryna touch up somethin'
before the c-o in the corner jump in, frontin'
late night reminiscing, everybody's quiet
i think something's in the air, prepare for the riot
it's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs
i touch 'em with thug love and then let they heads ring
i started a war, but now i'm gone
release me to the streets in the morning
it's on, soon as i get home


grab my gats, locate my comrades
let's get my enemies not knowing i'm coming back
let's get my money out the safe
it's time to turn the streets into a war zone
soon as i get home


since you've been gone
my whole life's been like a game of cee-low
thinking big, like the kid from casino
fulfillin' my dreams, like nino
brown, the whole town be shook up
and me and mama surviving
depends on how many rocks a nigga cook up
narcotics got traffic, seen those niggas you blasted
wanting me in a casket, on a ground, kind of plastic
yeah, nigga, i heard, lil' mu gave the word
you get paroled on the third, it's all love
we out here frontin', still here but all about nothin'
but double o's is what i'm wantin'
and i'm tryna see somethin' that we ain't never had
luxury life, results living bad
tricks of the trade, shit that should've been taught by dad
but learned through the crew
lessons between me and you
and once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do
meanwhile i stay waiting by the phone
hoping i'll get a call telling a nigga that you home


grab the gats, locate my comrades
let's get my enemies not knowing i'm coming back
go get my money out the safe
it's time to turn the streets into a war zone
soon as i get home

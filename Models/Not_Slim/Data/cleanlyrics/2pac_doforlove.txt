turn it up loud
hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
you a little sucker for love, right?
word up, hahahahaha


i shoulda seen
you was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
how not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
when this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
we had some problems but we workin at it, and now
the arguments are gettin' loud, i wanna stay
but i can't help from walkin' out just throw it away
just take my hand and understand, if you could see
i never planned to be your man it just wasn't me
but now i'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
i wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
soon as i open up the door with your jealous questions
like where can i be you're killin' me with your jealousy
now my ambition's to be free
i can't breathe, cause soon as i leave, it's like a trap
i hear you callin' me to come back, i'm a sucka for love


what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up
what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up


just when i thought i broke away and i'm feelin' happy
you try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could i do? so now i'm back
to makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
what if i'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
i'm bout to lose my composure, i'm gettin' close
to packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
tell me who knows, a peaceful place where i can go
to clear my head i'm feelin low, losin control
my heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
when we conspire to conceive, and now
you gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
that's all i need to hear cause i'm leavin', i'm out the do'
never no more will you see me, this is the end
cause now i know you've been cheatin, i'm a sucka for love


what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up
what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up


now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
as you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
it wasn't always a hit and run relationship
it use to be love, happiness and companionship
remember when i treated you good
i moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
me and you a happy home, when it was on
i had a love to call my own
i shoulda seen you was trouble but i was lost, trapped in your eyes
preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
you had a man and i knew it, you told me
don't worry bout it we can do it now i'm under pressure
make a decision cause i'm waitin', when i'm alone
i'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
i wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
but i need your faith in me, i'm a sucka for love


what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up
what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up

what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up
what you won't do, do for love
you tried everything, but you don't give up
what you won't do, (do for love)
you tried everything, but you don't give up
what you won't do, (do for love)
you tried everything, but you don't give up
do for love, yeah baby yeah
do for love

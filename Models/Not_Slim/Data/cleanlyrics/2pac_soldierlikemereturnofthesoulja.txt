posse deep as i role through the streets
motherfuck the police as we creep, in our jeeps
laying so long you think i'm asleep
but at the slightest beef, i'm robbing niggas through the teeth
and opd can get the dick if they play tuffy
last time them niggas rushed me, i ain't bust but now i'm touchy
trust me, ain't nothing jumping but these buck shots
them niggas got enough knots, i'm popping corrupt cops
ya motherfuckaz catch a hot one
you wanted to start a problem, now you coward cops have got one
and there's no prison that can hold a
motherfucking soulja, ready to role and take control
so now i jack 'em while they sleeping
role to the door, through a grenade in the precinct
some people panic, brothers bugged out
i had to keep popping, cuz wouldn't stop until they rugged out
and they vest don't protect from the head wounds
reload ammunitions and them bitches will be dead soon
smoke rising from the barrel of my shotty
i finally got revenge, now count the bodies
twenty cops, one for every year in jail
trying to keep a nigga down, but ya failed
before i let ya take me, i told ya
fuck being trapped, i'm a soulja


i betcha that i got something you ain't got, that's called courage
it don't come from no liquor bottle, it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
i don't walk around like no g, cuz that ain't me, i'm not that person
i don't try to act like you do, cuz that ain't you, you just fronting
you ain't?


it's twopac in the mad bitch
in them six-'fo, rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch
getting ghosts on them bitches in the town
busting out the backseat, nigga when we clown
homie is you down?
b got the strap and she anxious
hurry up 'fo she spank shit
comming round the corners, spitting rounds
they paying homie down
caught them sucka ass bitches outta bounce
now tell me how that sound?
a double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day
now tell me how that sound?
a double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day
stinking biatch!


i betcha that i got something you ain't got, that's called courage

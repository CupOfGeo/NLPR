thugs known to bust on sight

came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die

bitches and niggas in penitentiary suits
i send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
as for you females, i got no time, i gotta get mine
you cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
my time as shorty was full of car chases
while runnin' with john gotti's and scarface's
niggas knew, i'd be the don in my own crew
a million niggas with automatics who swarm through
you wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches

i beef deep with the police, peep what these streets do to me
actin' all new to me, i creep on you like puberty
you don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage
from here to east greenwich through every state with a sentence
frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
one two's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
when i'm drinkin' cristal, start thinkin' 'bout al
bacardi coverin' my body at the wink and a smile
bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you

i'm hittin' sixteen switches, my money over bitches
the struggle continues i'll miss you on my road to riches
i'm contrited to strive never laggin'
disappear in the night with my sixty-four dragon, rag flaggin'
as i get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
pager blowin' up but i don't give a, fuck
i'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin'
loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
so what can you do for me and what can i do for you
but stay true, and do the things that we do
blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
losin' my mind why you sweatin' me all the time
i'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
i'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches

that's from the time a nigga close his eyes i'm hopin', i hope he awoken
payin' my own that's tokin' chokin' off-a glocks smokin'
money and power watch these bitches cause they skanless
gettin' niggas fucked 'n stuck from timbuk' to los angeles
ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy heine' guzzler
cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin' ya
me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks
deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops
gettin' kicked, i keep my mind on my riches
while uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin' my money over all my bitches

straight outta oakland, california where we spark it on ya
give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
i remember drinkin' hennessy, smokin' weed
fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
had a partner named snupe, loved to clown a stank
smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
shootin' craps in the alley 'til they chased us off
pour a little for my homies, but don't waste it all
ooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
on my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
havin' house parties in a crowded spot
and you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
lookin' dumb, cause you waitin' for your chance to hump
straight grindin', everybody havin' fun
and it's cool, 'til a fool pull a loaded gun
cause another dude kicked his bacardi over
he had to act a fool, now the party's over
gun shots rang like it's thunder
and everybody bum rushin' and i'm rushin' to get a number
says she got a man but she's lyin'
why? i seen her talkin' to this other guy and
he's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
i ain't trippin', i just hope he get 'em, i got nuttin but love


ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(i'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(i'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(i'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(i'm down for yours)

i love to go back, to the block i got my game from
and pay respect to the place that i came from
cause uh, old man still drinkin', his breath still stinkin'
he'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin'
but i can't diss him he's my elder
he been livin' here longer what that tell ya?
and little girls playin' double dutch
still blush, cause she don't get in trouble much
it's uh, ponytails and barrettes
i gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
and little boys playin' stick ball, quick y'all
get out the street before they hit y'all
and as i reminisce, i think about my ghetto bliss
and wonder how we came to this
i help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
i can't take what she offers me
and this is how the world could be
this is how the world should be
feels good to be back on the streets
cause i know they got love for me, nuttin but love


ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(i'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(i'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(i'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(i'm down for yours)

when i was young i used to want to be a dealer see
cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
i saw our brothers gettin' rich slangin' crack to folks
and the square's gettin' big for these sack of dope
started thinkin' bout a plan to get paid myself
so i made myself, raised myself
'til the dealer on the block told me, "that ain't cool
you ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool"
i got my game about women from a prostitute
and way back used to rap on the block for loot
i tried to make my way legit, haha
but it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
and uhh, it was funny how i copped out
i couldn't make it in school, so finally i dropped out
my family on welfare
i'm steady thinkin', since don't nobody else care
i'm out here on my own
at least in jail i have a meal and i wouldn't be alone
i'm feelin' like a waste, tears rollin' down my face
cause my life is filled with hate
until i looked around me
i saw nuttin but family, straight up down for me
panthers, pimps, pushers and thugs
hey yo, that's my family tree, i got nuttin but love


ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(yeah, nuttin but love)

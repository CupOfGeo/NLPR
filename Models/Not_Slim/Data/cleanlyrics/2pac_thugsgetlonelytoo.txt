hahahaha, man, you crazy

see, it ain't easy bein' me
life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
i got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasing me around
and it's always drama, whenever i wanna get around
momma told me, long before i ever came up
gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up
'cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor
best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
i'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
and i got no time to worry, i'm steady wanting more
every day is a test, yes, i try hard
but i'm strugglin' with every breath, i pray to god
that the woman that i left at home, all alone
there ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone
in my mind i can see her naked, i can't take it
got me shaking at the thought that we can make it
i thought you knew


i'm rollin' out on tour today
you getting sad, 'cause i'm going away
the chickenheads wanna play with me
you getting mad, 'cause you think i'ma sway
some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
i hear 'em scream soon as i hit the stage, nah...
still i be getting lonely for you
i'm coming home soon as i make this pay, make this pay


i call you up long distance, on the telephone
wanna tuck you in even though i can't make it home
i whisper things in your ear like you're near me
wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
it seems to me, that you're jealous
'cause i'm hustling and making money with the fellas
in the back streets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!
thugs get lonely too, but i'm a soldier
and there's no way i'ma stop making money
'cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny
always complaining, saying we don't spend time
can't you see i got enough stress on my mind?
and hanging up like you all that
then get mad when i tell you that i'm busy, baby, call back
please, ain't nothing left to say to you
thugs get lonely too, you know


i'm rollin' out on tour today
you getting sad, 'cause i'm going away
the chickenheads wanna play with me
you getting mad, 'cause you think i'ma sway
some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
i hear 'em scream soon as i hit the stage, nah...
still i be getting lonely for you
i'm coming home soon as i make this pay, make this pay


i sit alone in my room, drinking without a care
talking out loud to you, like you're there
take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
you're the first face i wanna see when i get home
wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
touching every wall in the house, thug style
put your hands on the headboard, think of me
drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
this in your head that i'm making love, so turn the lights down
reminisce and relax 'cause, baby, right now
i feel it in the middle of my stomach
you whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it
hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
'cause everything i'm giving to you, is so true
and thugs get lonely too, you know


i'm rollin' out on tour today
you getting sad, 'cause i'm going away
the chickenheads wanna play with me
you getting mad, 'cause you think i'ma sway
some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
i hear 'em scream soon as i hit the stage, nah...
still i be getting lonely for you
i'm coming home soon as i make this pay, make this pay


yeah, thug life, baby! steady thuggin'
aye, so you remember that
next time you sweating me when i'm on the road, baby
thugs get lonely too
we ain't gotta go through all this bullshitting ass problems
if you wanna be real with me, be real with me
if you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me

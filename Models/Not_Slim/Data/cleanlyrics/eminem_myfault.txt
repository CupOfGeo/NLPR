and now it's my fault my fault

i went to john's rave with ron and dave
and met a new wave blonde babe
with half of her head shaved
a nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
susan an ex-heroin addict who just stopped using
who love booze and alternative music. what's up
told me she was going back into using again
i said wait first try this hallucinogen
it's better than heroin, henn, the booze and the gin
come here let's go in here
who's in the den?
(it's me and kelly)
my bad, sorry!
let's try another room
"i don't trust you"
shut up slut chew up this mushroom
this'll help you get in touch with your roots
we'll get bare-foot butt-naked and run in the woods
"oh hell might as well try 'em this party is so drag."
oh dang i ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!
(huh)

she said "help me i think i'm having a seizure!"
i said "i'm high too, bitch. quit grabbing my t-shirt (let go!)
would you calm down you're starting to scare me
she said "i'm twenty-six years old and i'm not married
i don't even have any kids and i can't cook"

(i'mma kill him!)
"john, where's dave at before i bash you?"
he's in the bathroom; i think he's taking a crap dude!
"dave! pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
there's a girl upstairs talking to plants
chopping her hair off
and there's only two days left of spring break
how long do these things take to wear off?"
well it depends on how many you had?
i took three she ate the other twenty-two caps
now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs
drinking lysol
"she's gonna die dude."
i know and it's my fault!

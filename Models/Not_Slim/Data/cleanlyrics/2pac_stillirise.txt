dear lord, as we down here, struggle for as long as we know
in search of a paradise to touch (my nigga johnny j)
dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go, the only place for us
i know, try to make the best of bad situations
seems to be my life's story
ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
and can't nobody live this life for me
it's a ride y'all, a long hard ride


somebody wake me, i'm dreamin'
i started as a seed, the semen
swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'
on the top was my pops, my mama screamin' stop
from a single drop, this is what they got
not to disrespect my peoples, but my papa was a loser
only plan he had for mama was to fuck her and abuse her
even as a little seed, i could see his plan for me
stranded on welfare, another broken family
now what was i to be? a product of this heated passion
mama got pregnant and papa got a piece of ass
look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
how can i survive? got me askin' white jesus
"will a nigga live or die?" cause the lord can't see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
no sunny days and we only play sometimes
when everybody's sleepin'
i open my window, jump to the streets and get to creepin'
i can live or die, hope i get some money 'fore i'm gone
i'm only nineteen, i'm tryna hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryna slang rocks
i'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
you can buy rocks, glocks or a herringbone
you can ask my man, he's a mind reader
keep my nine heater all the time, this is how we grind
meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out
pass the weed, nigga! that hennessey'll keep me keyed, nigga
everywhere i go niggas holla at me, "keep it real, g"
and my reply 'til they kill me: "act up if you feel me!"
i was born not to make it, but i did
the tribulations of a ghetto kid, still i rise


still i (still i), i rise (i rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky)
and if (and if), i die (i die), i don't want you to cry


i stay sharp as always
runnin' your bricks with blitz, through your project hallways
dumpin' crews like two's, nigga, all day
secrets of war prepare me for the worst
a life that's lavish, full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
but now my dreams, it seems though
be placin' triple beams and things, bro
diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans


now i plan to keep my glock cocked
if trouble was searchin' for me, then why not?
show 'em what i'm made of, plus raised on, on my block
chancellor ave, where many turn to the street
thugs snatchin' bags, we out for power, makin' cash
it wasn't fast, it'll make me mad, i'm just like him
my homie on the corner with his gat tucked in
youngins, they buckin' somethin'
the life he lead's the life he don't need, don't we all know?
he tryin' to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise


dreams of lost hope
i hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
and still i rise, now i float, cowards ghost
whenever we come around, i'm runnin' down
clutchin' a pound, live as sirens, duckin' the sound
i used to hustle with my moms 'til the sun came
my homie harm doin' time from this drug game
stolen cars, war scars, born a outlaw
behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
crackheads only ten learn to duck cops


in 'ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blastin' bastards
no faces for open caskets, peelin' your cap backwards
you cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
i send my missiles through your mattress
leavin' holes in your body like a cactus
while me and my crew be boppin' more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin'
leavin' your spleen to pick up
half of you niggas is softer than a snicker
let's go to war and see who draw quicker
and still i rise, and still i rise


still i (still i), i rise (i rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky)
and if (and if), i die (i die), i don't want you to cry
still i (still i), i rise (i rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky)
and if (and if), i die (i die), i don't want you to cry

y'all niggas fake, all day everyday
so now i got roller blades, bitch
thought you knew
your mouth is rich
c'mon pops, let's go!

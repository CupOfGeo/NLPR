and see a nigga gettin' cuffed by the boys in blue
is it a, frame up, tryin' to keep me out the game, stuck
these motherfuckers tryin' to dirty up my name, but
i slip as quick as the wind, it's me or them, fuck friends
my foes be on a mission, tryin' to do me in
fuck 'em i'm out to get out, they all thought
i blow up like a gauge, and in a rage, blow they balls off
why are you niggas tryin' to test me trick?
and be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
my main thang with a nigga meal ticket only if you with the real
the nigga will kick it, i'll enforce it with the steel
use the lessons that i learned in jail
rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in hell
now i'm workin' with connects that i got in the pen
in no time i'll be clockin' again

hey, still sittin' in my cell as i dwell on my past
tryin' to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
quick, call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
my cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
and my c.o. is a lady, and i'm thinkin' maybe
me and her can hook up a scheme, to be swayze
cause she keep on callin' me baby, to a young
motherfucker facin' eighty that's enough to make you crazy
now how long will it take, to get a hook
got her watchin' me liftin' weights, sneakin' looks
i devised a plan, i'm in the trunk while she drives the van
ain't no disguise i'ma die as a man
if we make it then i'm takin' it to hell
all them niggas that was frontin' while i sat up in a cell
locked in jail, i couldn't touch her so i planned, in misery
the nigga you don't wanna see

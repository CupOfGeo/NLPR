young thugs in this motherfucker
don't break up the fight, let 'em rumble
don't make enemies with me
i try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
don't make enemies with me


some say my criminal experience is legendary
i do what's necessary
niggas wanna see me buried
worried, if you comin' hurried
i ain't goin' down, fuck the world i'm a thug
tell 'em can't nothin' stop me but a slug
i went from drug dealin' to a shot caller
from off the block, no longer rock
and puttin' money in my pocket, nationwide baller
bitch nigga i'm prepared to die, before i fry
i hit the weed so i be forever high
my eyes has seen so much in misery, so before i flee
i open fire let the lord pick the first to bleed
bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thuggin'
tell 'em bury me a g on everything i love
and fuck the law cause the raw niggas ain't free
this picture's clear but we can't see, hahaha
this game is jealousy, don't let 'em change
that's what they keep on tellin' me, motherfuck the fame
i can't sleep cause i keep hearin' peeps
loaded mossberg wrapped in my sheets


don't make enemies with me
i try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
don't make enemies with me
you rather fuck with these other little g's
don't make enemies with me, nigga
i try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
don't make enemies with me

the game is gettin' deeper with this i couldn't stop, i'm reminiscin'
and havin' flashbacks when them niggas came up missin'
(wish in my heart, these niggas they ain't have to start)
(now therefore they gotta see in dark)
(played the part with heart when we spark they part)
(runnin' silly through the court),
they don't really wanna start
(how you wanna do?)
yo k, anyway
these motherfuckers wanna play we can do it all day
so i stay, sippin' on my array to keep my head fine
(and i'm where, everywhere from here to bedtime)
yeah nigga
and i squeeze when i say i'm comin'
straight gunnin' on enemies if it's really me that they wantin'
(cause it ain't nothin', y'all niggas is frontin')
do you really want it? niggas dyin'...

 in a flash sittin' on that ass
(and rarely fold)
galitter tell 'em 'bout that trife shit
(you wanna fight?)
(i wanna light shit, you lose your life bitch)
bee-yatch!
a nigga struggle too hard for what i got
hustle
(and doubled every fuckin' yard that i cop and stop)
(hell nah! i couldn't see it)
(facin' a century in the penitentiary but so be it)
and jesus couldn't help me out the state
(prepare for an early date to see my fate at the pearly gate)
(but wait)
no time for stallin'
(but death is callin')
you wanna stomp on it somebody's gotta start fallin'
(true, what i do from sun up)
is for a come up
(wake up with my gun up)
cause when i sneak that's when they run up
(so it's time to spray like ray)
(and put the freeze on these fake g's)
you know how we do

plans to leave, throw the keys to lil cease
pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt
so we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
a t-bone steak, cheese eggs and welch's grape
conversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do
what we came to do, ain't that right, boo. true

and watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke ls while you do me

i love it when you call me big poppa
to the honies getting money playing niggaz like dummies

compton is where im from
is where im from, is where im from



yeah, yeah
young egypt
look, look
i feel like pacino in godfather, im charged
our father who art in heaven, kendrick at large
came in the game with a plan of beatin the odds
what an accomplishment, broken promises
kept my focus anonymous till i dealt with the consequence
the greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is
you niggas fear me like yall fear god
you sound frantic, i hear panic in your voice
just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin your bars
before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
before you step out of line and dance with the star
i could never end a career if it never start
the murderous capital, avenues lookin like evil dead zombies
with batteries to the head
the flattery of watchin my stock rise
the salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
i run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
just premium gas, do it for dolo
crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
black excellence, pessimist died countin my coin
hope its evident that i inspired a thousand emcees to do better
i blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and bimmers and blue leather
forecasted my future, this is the future
the mastermind until my next album, more power to you
gunshots



come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on, come on
come on

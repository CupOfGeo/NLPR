it don't take a lot to keep a nigga heart
must be a lady in the light but real freaky in the dark
plus i got some enemies, baby, hold my pistol
and wrap your arms around a nigga every time i kiss you
can you visualize the picture, me and you in ecstasy
don't be upset, it's good sex, when you next to me
do you wanna test me, put your tired head on my chest
a thug nigga's in the house, now you can rest
i bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out
and felt the pleasure and the pain
about to fuck the very taste out your mouth
if you call me when you need me
one-eight hundred-skypage, when you wanna see me
cause i can be your man
and, baby, you can be my lady
but you gotta give a nigga space or you'll drive me crazy

can't do a damn thang for you, if ya ain't about money
nine times outta ten, i'll ignore you, it's a man's world
but real women make the shit go around

and put the game down tight
for these gamin' bitches could get it right
it might be a plan that i'm chosen
don't get in confusion
because i'm known for showin' examples how i do it
thinkin' i'm new to this, because i'm younger
where i'll only leave you suspicious and to wonder
and at the end i make a come up
nigga, was raised up off of m.o.b.
fetti over something
that's tellin' me don't run the streets

for tryin' to communicate through a song
i'm up early in the morning, by sunrise i'll be gone
all my homies is waitin' for me
plottin' on plans that we made and all the fun that it's gonna be
so meet me at three'
and don't be late nigga
we hangin' out all night while drinkin' straight liquor
i heard it's poppin' at a club
but they say i can't get in, cause i'm dressed like a thug
until i die
i'll be game related
got me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated
now that we made it
it's a battle just for the big money
i'm livin' wild, no smiles, cause ain't a thing funny
i came up hungry, just a lil' nigga, tryin' to make it
i only got one chance, so i gotta take it
ya never know when it's all gonna happen

but until then give me love
and let me run the streets

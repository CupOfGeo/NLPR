high speed
for all my niggas livin' in the rush
slow it down just a notch baby
it's goin' be alright, it's goin' be alright


life at high speed, life at high speed
fuck the punishment, thai weed
(buy me a gun), liquor and puffin' thai weed


i live life high speed
slightly disillusioned by weed
i breed thug muthafuckas even worse than me
when i bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly
harm me, my army
niggas decease swiftly
look at you now, why you wanna act out?
i pull the hammer back
strike wit' a cannon that'll blow yo muthafuckin' back out
they blast but i'm still standin'
slightly scarred
deep questions for the lord "why he don't like me, god?"
so, though my life was hard with no remorse
i absorb all lessons, provide protection for the boss
rollin' in my double r, rugged and ruthless
keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
and my crew, we crooked, be mistaken for jewels
we all about our cash, blast if you break the rules
fools turned snitch for the d.a., be heaven-sent
switched like a stone-bitch, turned state's evidence, why?
then they wonder why niggas die
put your family in danger, just to get high
now, what the hell can we get from jail?
more tricks for the crime trade, this is hell
bail out, a thug nigga fresh out the jailhouse
open your safe count and take all the mail out
whatever happens happens
whoever falls dies
we fresh out of time, livin' blind, so we all ride
in times like these, chronic or thai weed
puffin' through this high speed
and people say...


whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
i'm gonna buy me a gun
then what's next?
food and sex, house parties in the projects
we goin' all night
whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
i'm gonna buy me a gun
then what's next?
food and sex, house parties in the projects

verbal assassin, i hit the corner fast, blastin'
hot plastic stretch your chest plate back like elastic
no need to push me to split ya
i love beef, like pussy and pistols
for all you pussies that's softer than tissue
i ride by like the fall guy out the roof
bustin' at you wise guy, gettin' high, sippin' hundred proof (yeah)
give me the joints low to verdict wit' mine
get that ass attacked, murdered, and robbed, blind from behind
rapid shots pourin'
catchin' niggas while they snorin'
kickin' his door in
i'll leave your whole fuckin' family in mournin'
bust me, you itchy-bitchy types can't touch me
frontin' like you're hard
i'll play your fuckin' yard like a trussel


whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
i'm gonna buy me a gun
then what's next?
food and sex, house parties in the projects
we goin' all night
whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?

at times, i look through times wit' so much anger
wonderin' why it keeps on passin', pushin' me into danger
no stranger to hard times or the good ones
at times i'm amazed
at what the motherfuckin' hoods done
what we do to get paid
all day, for the almighty, dollar
don't even bother to holla
we all destined to be swallowed
by the same thing we lust for
threw away our morals and values and dust more
niggas is dying tomorrow
we, bailing on borrowed times
nigga the clocks tickin'
approachin' is the day you gonna need money or glocks spittin'
cops sittin', politicians passin' laws you ain't know what
soon that money gon' be illegal when you die to
keep your dough up
but i ain't goin' tell you "what?" to stop chasin' paper
man, i'm just like y'all, i worry 'bout that shit later
put the metal to the pedal, slash up nigga, blaze
let's get blowed out high speed 'til the end of my days
now my people say


whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?

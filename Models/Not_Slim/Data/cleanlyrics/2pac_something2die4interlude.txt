ghetto!

i've changed?
you motherfuckers kill me....
i've changed?

it ain't that i've changed
but it's strange how you motherfuckers rearrange
when i found fame
point ya finger at tha bad guy!

you know what my momma used to tell me
if ya can't find something to live for...
...then you best, find something ta die for

 "if there's hell below, we're all gonna go!"


deep deep

la'tasha harlins, remember that name...
cause a bottle of juice... ain't something to die for

young quaid, remember that name...
cause all you motherfuckers
that go to your grave with that name on your brain
cause jealousy and recklessness is not, something to die for

all you niggas out there 
look how the cracker crumbles
when i say 'all you niggas' (all you niggas)

unite
one nigga, teach two niggas
four niggas teach more niggas
all the poor niggas
the pen niggas
the rich niggas
the strong niggas
unite

there's more of us than there is of them
look around...
check your strip

deep deep
that's something to die for

black
that's something to live for

what do i know?

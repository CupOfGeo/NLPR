we goin' all out, we goin' all out
we goin' all out
watch your motherfuckin' mouth, niggas!
(that's right, fuck these fag niggas!)
do it, do it, do it!


come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
just another lost soul, stuck, callin' jehovah
outlaw 'til it's over, brandish my strap, back like a cobra
i stay drunk, 'cause i'm a mad man whenever sober
on a one-man mission, my ambition's to hold up
the rap game, while i pluck holes in niggas, like donuts
and still down to die for all my soldiers, like hillbillies
they don't fear me, so we feud, bringin' war to the city
with each breath, death before dishonor
never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor
a general in war, i'm the first to bomb
with a squad of trusted killers
quick to move shit heavily armed
i'm similar to saddam, sometimes i question who's sane
like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
i hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
i take the figure of thirty niggas who all got me
while bitches wonderin' who shot me
no love, keep a grudge, shootin' slugs like muammar gaddafi
murder my friends, build a new posse
we takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga, like rocky
you got a lot of nerve to play me
another gay rapper, bustin' caps at jay z
(buck buck buck buck buck!) and still avoid capture
while y'all caught up in the rapture, still after me
i'm in jamaica, sippin' daiquiris, no doubt
we used to havin' nothin'
then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasn't
i can't tour, fear of catchin' cases, litigation
niggas playa-hatin', got me crooked in all fifty states
i'm screamin', "death row!"
throw my westside, ain't no thang
we was raised off drive-bys, brought up to bang
we claim mob, m.o.b., if you be specific
we control all cash from atlantic-pacific
and get this: i'm hard to kill when i peel with this live spot
father, how the hell did i survive these five shots?
live it up or give it up, and like demons
late night, hear them screamin', "we goin' all out!"


we goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
take them the war route, without a doubt
ball, which means we all ride if it's on
each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
if you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
obstacles in your way, you better go all out


i'm on my last leg, walkin' through the belly of the beast
feelin' like i'm all out, drunk as can be
it's plain to see, that we mob niggas hidin' in bushes
claimin' that they ride rough, but they softer than cushion
they softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin' in blood
outlawz, my blood brothers, i'd die for these thugs
say hi to this slug, it's a shame how some niggas on the west coast was ridin' with 'pac, but when he died, they went pop
i'm out in jers, to the fullest, like some west coast love
but after 'pac stopped rappin', it ain't no west coast thug
just west coast slut
to my real niggas stuck in the street game, 'cause rappers like jay z be pumpin' kool-aid through they veins
is it true what i'm sayin'? slap your soft ass to the floor
and watch my fo'-fo' put peek holes through your door
i ride or die, but these other fag niggas be bitin' this
it's all from my heart when i was writin' this; all out!


we goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
take them the war route, without a doubt
ball, which means we all ride if it's on
each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
if you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
obstacles in your way, you better go all out


now, we all ride, and down to die; who with us?
speak up, or get treated like you comin' to kill us
they ain't nothin' but squealers
in this rap game, swearin' they rough
tattooed up, and now them niggas swearin' they 'pac
stop that, and watch your back, we ain't forgot 'bout ya
these glocks hot, and when shot, it'll bring the bitch up out ya
it's me, kastro with the goattee
walkin' like a og, 'cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
i pray to thug lords, like them motherfuckers holy
frontline soldier, 'til the heavens call me
i go all out, and if you real, you real
feel what i'm talkin' 'bout, 'cause this game is ill
i live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'til they feel it
livin' proof, pac breed niggas they can't deal with
holla back, right back, and watch your mouth
or get blood in it, what; we goin' all out, nigga!


we goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
take them the war route, without a doubt
ball, which means we all ride if it's on
each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
if you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
obstacles in your way, you better go all out


fool, you better go all out
keep goin' all out
all my niggas goin' all out
without a muthafuckin' doubt
aye, you niggas just gon' think you gon' be uh
talkin' slick on all of these motherfuckin' records
and we ain't gon' say shit
now it's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, it's a different grind
don't disrespect the don
it's still war, motherfuckers
so let's see you act like you know

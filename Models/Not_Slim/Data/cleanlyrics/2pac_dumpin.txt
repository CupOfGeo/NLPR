who you are
one nation under a thug and bullet scar
young nation, no revolution and no cause
one nation, young black and dangerous by far
young nation just tryin' to get this

 
murderous mind state, can't keep my nine straight
sippin' on this hennessy, waitin' for the time to break
show up and motherfuckers bow down, recognize
westside, death row, outlaw ridaz
untouchable mob of pistol packers
well-known felons, labeled for drug-sellin' merciless jackers
forever buzzed, roll with thugs and dogs
commence to lettin' off rounds, then escape in a fog
who wanna see me solo?
catch makaveli while he's sleepin'
my mini-fourteen murderin' niggas while they creepin'
uh, duck or you ass out, drink 'til you pass out
ain't scared to die, drunk drivin' in my glasshouse
niggas is under me, they bitches come to me
they heard the stories, nigga, now they wanna really see
"bomb first" my motto, it's fully guaranteed
niggas is playa haters, label them my enemies; i'm dumpin'


who you are
one nation under a thug and bullet scar
young nation, no revolution and no cause
one nation, young black and dangerous by far
young nation just tryin' to get this

 
when it's on, i'm poppin' off every chance i get
out the window on some uptown anthem shit
i'm stressin', but ain't no pressure here, i been there before
fugitive, task force at my girlfriend door
now they checkin' out my bedroom, i ain't there
.forty cal's, extended clips, still i ain't scared
outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive
i'm different, and i'ma prove it if it take me to die
knew that god had a plan for me
but he won't be layin' up in my casket
or doing life in the can for me
maybe i'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch
me dyin', you think i'd let them see the joy from that shit?
walking dead, angel spend they last days by me
new jersey giant, like dave tyree
young george and jonathan jatt
your guns clap, mine'll go brraaatt, soldier like geronimo pratt
and come through cockin' the black pound
when they put the twin towers up
pac, i'm knockin' them back down
poster child cheque, air force ones
with the crooked dial checks, i'm supposed to wild sex
money and murder is all i breathe in my life
it's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
through the henny i see the eyes of the devil
g ridin' with extra boxes of bullets to the nine and the shovel


who you are
one nation under a thug and bullet scar
young nation, no revolution and no cause
one nation, young black and dangerous by far
young nation just tryin' to get this

 
i always thought i'd have to die to do a record with pac
so i wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
you end up in a box, 'cause them graverobbin' bastards
dig your grave back up, snatched you out the casket
worms in my eyes, eatin' through my cabbage
the flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
but i'm not dead, i'm actually in a session
with the pac keepin' the shot money, progressive
they don't really want no drama, i know you're goons
that's why i keep pressure on them, like a open wound
this god-given, he keep givin' me better music
so every time you hear me, my songs present improvement
y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin'
songs are evolution
if i load your gun for you and we bang it out at some other niggas, you better shoot it
don't try to lie and say you was bustin'i'm clever, stupid!
claimin' you reppin' ruthless
you got the same bullets that you had
when i loaded it for you, you never used it
the nacirema dream get ready for execution
papoose, fatal and pacthe revolution


who you are
one nation under a thug and bullet scar
young nation, no revolution and no cause
one nation, young black and dangerous by far
young nation just tryin' to get this

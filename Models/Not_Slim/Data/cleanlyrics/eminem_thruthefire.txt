nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands we are dealt
we have to take these cards ourselves
and flip them. dont expect no help
now i could have 
either just
sat on my ass
and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which i am placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid
to wait by the door and pack his bags
who sat on the posch hoped and prayed 
for a dad to show who never did
i just wanted to fit in
at every single place
every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it means acting stupid
aunt edna always told me
keep making
that face itll get stuck like that
meanwhile i am just standing
there holding
my tongue tryna talk like this
till i stuck my tongue 
on that
frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
i learned my lesson then
cauz i wasnt tryna impress my friends no more
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
cauz where you see it from where you are sitting
its probably one hundred and ten% different
i guess we would have to walk a mile
in each others shoes
at least 
what size you wear??
i wear tens
lets see if you can fit your feet


i am going up
i am going all the way through the fire
i get up and go higher 
so please dont bring me down
and nothing is gonna bring me down
i am going all the way thru the fire
i will get up and then go higher
so please dont knock me down
and nothing is gonna knock me down

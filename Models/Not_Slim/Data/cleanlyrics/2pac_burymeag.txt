bury me a g
thug life
feel me


thinkin' back, reminiscin' on my teens
a young g gettin' paid over dope fiends
fuckin' off cash that i made
nigga, what's the sense of workin' hard if you never get to play
i'm hustlin', stayin' out 'til it's dawn
and comin' home at six o'clock in the mornin'
hand's on my glock, eyes on the prize
finger on the trigger when a nigga ride
shootin' craps, bustin' niggas out the door
pick my money off the floor, god bless the tre-four
stuck on full, drunk again
sippin' on gin with a couple of friends
say them thug life niggas be like major pimps
stickin' to the rules was a major sin
and if i die, let it be
but when it come for me, bury me a g


i ain't got time for bitches
gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
even when i die, they won't worry me
mama don't cry, bury me a g
i ain't got time for bitches
gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
even when i die, they won't worry me
mama don't cry, bury me a g


more trouble than the average
just made twenty-five and i'm livin' like a savage
being a g, it ain't no easy thing
'cause you could fuck around, get crossed and get stuck in the game
and for the rest of your life you will sit and reminisce
wonder why it had to end like this
and to the g's you can feel my pain
until the motherfucker gets born again


you thought it was a game kid, i'm not the nigga for playin' game
i let my buckshots ring when i pull the trigger on my gauge
i'm on the rampage makin' runs for the devil
ain't nothin' on my mind will get me into trouble
i'm tryna ride no more loves for me hard to figure
get a nigga, smoke a blunt or it's a jury starts (break yo self)
i gives a fuck nigga stuck outta luck when i bust
pull me to my death but i'm a g to the enemy


i ain't got time for bitches
gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
even when i die, they won't worry me
mama don't cry, bury me a g

i got nothin' to lose so i choose to be a killer
went from bangin' to slangin', now i'm a dope dealer
all my life paid the price to be the boss
back to school, broke the rules on gettin' tossed
poppin' rocks on the block was a past time
pack a .nine all the time, you wanna test mine?
don't cry, i die before they play me
from the cradle to the grave, bury me g


straight thug kickin' it with the homies in the hood
gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts, my bitch said i'm no good
i gives a fuck i spend my time in the dope spot
never had no time for no bitch instead slangin' rocks
and bustin' caps on you punk ass marks
fake ass g's, bitch niggas with no heart
i'm stayin' real 'til i'm six feet deep
so when a nigga gone, just bury me a g

stuck on full, tanqueray got a nigga high
lord knows i don't need another dui
i led a thug life, heartless hustler
just 'cause i fuck don't mean i trust her
now my pagers vibratin', can't sleep
so i'm mobbin' to the ho's house, bumpin' isley
"is it cool to fuck?" is what i'm askin'
bitch recognize game and started laughin'
now i'm all in those guts and shit
prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
'cause i'll fuck and get up, i'll let you know
i'll be a ten minute brother for a $two ho
lots of ho's get mad and shit
i let a trick be a trick, you can have that bitch
'cause i doubt if i change, the game's a motherfucker
real niggas turn to busters, bury me a g

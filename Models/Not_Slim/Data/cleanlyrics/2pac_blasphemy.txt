god has a plan, and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan through the message of prophecy
god sent jesus into this world to be our savior and that christ is returning someday soon to unfold the wonderful plan of eternity
for my life and your life
as long as we're cooperating with god by accepting jesus christ as our personal lord and savior unless the lord does return in the coming seven days
we'll see you next time here on this week in bible prophecy


twopac, don't start that blasphemy in here!
makaveli, the new breed
and i remember what my pops told me
the new word, follow me
remember what my pops told me


my family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
strugglin', known to hustle screaming, "fuck they feelings!"
i got advice from my father, all he told me was this
nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!
there's ten rules to the game, but i'll share with you two
know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
now, rule one: get your cash on, m.o.b.
that's money over bitches, cause they breed envy
now rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies
keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies
it seemed a little unimportant, when he told me i smiled
picture jewels being handed to an innocent child
i never knew in my lifetime i'd live by these rules
initiated as an outlaw, studying rules
now papa ain't around, so i gotta recall
or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls
promised if i have a seed, i'ma guide him right
dear lord, don't let me die tonight
i got words for my comrades, listen and learn
ain't nothing free, get back what you earned
no doubt, getting higher than a motherfucker, bless me please
this thug life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah

and i remember what my papa told me
remember what my papa told me, blasphemy


love for dem dat steal in the name of da lord
dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud
(remember what my pops told me)
using the name of the lord in vain (blas-blas-blasphemy, blasphemy)
(remember what my pops told me)
while de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain


we probably in hell already, our dumb asses not knowing
everybody kissing ass to go to heaven ain't going
put my soul on it, i'm fighting devil niggas daily
plus the media be crucifying brothers severely
tell me i ain't god's son, nigga mom a virgin
we got evicted had to leave the 'burbs, back in the ghetto
doing wild shit, looking at the sun, don't pay
criminal mind all the time, wait for judgment day
they say moses split the red sea
i split the blunt and rolled a fat one up deadly
babylon beware, coming for the pharoah's kids
retaliation, making legends off the shit we did
still bullshittin', niggas in jerusalem waiting for signs
god coming, she's just taking her time (haha)
living by the nile while the water flow
i'm contemplating plots wondering where the thought'll go
brothas getting shot, coming back resurrected
it's just that raw shit, nigga, check it (that raw shit)

and i remember what my papa told me
remember what my papa told me, blasphemy


love for dem dat steal in the name of da lord
dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud
(remember what my pops told me)
using the name of the lord in vain
(remember what my pops told me)
while de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
(what!)


the preacher want me buried, why? cause i know he a liar
have you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire
why you got these kids' minds thinking that they evil?
while the preacher being freaky you say "honor god's people"
should we cry when the pope die? my request
we should cry if they cried when we buried malcolm x
mama, tell me am i wrong, is god just another cop?
waiting to beat my ass if i don't go pop?
memories of a past time, giving up cash to the leaders
knowing damn well they ain't gonna feed us
in my brain how can you explain time in b.c
it's hard enough to live now in these times of greed
they say jesus is a kind man
well, he should understand times in this crime land
my thug nation, do what you gotta do, but know you gotta change. try to find a way to make it out the game
i leave this, and hope god can see my heart is pure
is heaven just another door? i leave this here
i leave this, and hope god see my heart is pure
is heaven just another door? and my people say


love for dem dat steal in the name of da lord
dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud
(remember what my pops told me)
using the name of the lord in vain
(can't i remember what my pops told me, blasphemy)
while de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain

love for dem dat steal in the name of da lord
dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud

our father, who art in heaven
hallow be thy name
thy kingdom come, thy will be done
in earth as it is in heaven
give us this day, our daily bread
as we give up our debts
as we forgive our debt-ors
lead us not into temptation
but deliver us unevil
for god is the kingdom and the power
and the glory forever and ever and ever

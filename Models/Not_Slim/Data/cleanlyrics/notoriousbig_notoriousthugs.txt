it's bone and biggie, biggie
let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, get high
it's bone and biggie, biggie
notorious thugs, gangstas
it's bone and biggie, biggie
let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, get high


armed and dangerous
ain't too many can bang with us
straight up weed; no angel dust
label us "notorious thug-ass niggas
that love to bust," it's strange to us
y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
we just sittin' here tryna win, try not to sin
high off weed and lots of gin
so much smoke, need oxygen
steadily countin' them benjamins
nigga, you should too
if you knew what this game'll do to you
been in this shit since 'ninety-two
look at all the bullshit i been through!
so-called beef with you-know-who
fucked a few female stars or two
then i blew like, nigga, move like mike
shit, not to be fucked with
motherfucker better duck quick
'cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
no aspirations to quit the game
spit your game, talk your shit
grab your gat, call your clique
squeeze your clip, hit the right one
pass that weed, i got to light one
all them niggas, i got to fight one
all them hoes, i got to like one
our situation is a tight one
what you gonna do: fight or run?
seems to me that you'll take b
bone and big, nigga, die slowly
i'mma tell you like a nigga told me
"cash rules everything around me"
shit, lyrically, niggas can't see me
fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
nigga with a benz fuckin' it
doesn't it seem odd to you?
big come through with mobs and crews
goodfellas down to the mo' thugs dudes
who's the killer: me or you?

(we forgive you, for you know not what you do)


seven am, woke in the morning
with hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
no dough, so pop a couple of doze
lil' ripsta, nigga mista clean, nigga dean
deep in my temple and not to get sentimentally steamed
with my instrumelody, and heated, especially for your team
and a .forty-five indeed will beam in between the scenes
destroy your dreams; you willin' to die? we'll see
how many flee when i 'cause the scene?
we mean mug, mo' thugs, trained to be perfect disciples
when it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
triple six rivals spittin' fire
this the real truth, bitch, breakin' out for lies
my messiah's better be ready for armageddon, shit's expired
it's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
put in positions off in the clair
all that i had to do was stare
test me now, contender; never no surrender, no pretend
pick up my pen, in my hand, one of my trusted friend-friends
hey, open it! let's see if we're real, we all suited
beg my pardon to martin, baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
in daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
we start 'em off little, we give 'em a bible
and a pen and a pad to hit the label  kick it, nigga!


nigga roll with bone up into the thug spot
to the dome with a shot of bird
never get tossed to the curb
be feelin' that urge to splurge
but i'm broke as fuck, sin, give me that mossberg swerve!
up into my bag, 'cause i gotta get my mask and shells
to put in this twelve gauge sawed-off
get 'em hauled off, nigga, your loss
take it all off, got a nigga caught off
but the bone, not leatherface
too many are thinkin' they thugs
and little mo hart want to pull it and bust it
and bitch, if you steppin', we buckin' them guts  that's fucked up
now let me get done with the grime
gotta go purchase a dime
put in a state to get done with the crime
smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
but really we be servin' them dummies, see?
gotta buck him on down
if he come back talkin', like, "give me back me money!"
thuggin' with me killers
need us a liter of liquor, but niggas ain't got shit
with a sawed-off pump, chrome .thirty-eight pistol
now, who ready to get bent?
nigga like me fiendin' for them green leaves
but i ain't had no dough
gotta make some money
so i'm makin' my dummy rocks if i go broke


it's bone and biggie, biggie
(we gonna rock the party, rock the party, party)
it's bone and biggie, biggie
(better run and tell everybody, everybody, everybody)
let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
get high, get high, get high, c'mon
let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
get high, get high, get high


yeah, little lay, hey, comin' in the form of scripture
finna get ya and hit ya with magic
droppin' down lead, but i call it my gadgets
with an automatic-status, we spray
time to load the glocks, but i'm thinkin' not
there's another evil force tellin' me to do what i gotta do
so i up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
and i'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
biggie, blue's on my ass
pull out the cellular phone to call bone, "what's happenin'?"
grab artillery, a nigga start packin'
'cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin'
and i did him, hit him right between the eyes
the spot was wise; wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
y'all get mo' murdered all day, all day
we done paved the way and i'm on the run
i'mma call my boys and bring all the guns
y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with number one?
bloody red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
that red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
that red, red, rum


it's bone and biggie, biggie
(we gonna rock the party, rock the party, party)
it's bone and biggie, biggie
(better run and tell everybody, everybody, everybody)
let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
get high, get high, get high, c'mon
let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
get high, get high, get high

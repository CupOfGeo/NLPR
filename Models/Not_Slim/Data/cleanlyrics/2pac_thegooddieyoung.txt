these some hard times we livin' in
churches burnin', planes fallin' from the sky
murder, the good die young
hahaha, the good definitely die young
this is a lil' somethin' 
to help you get through the day
if it could


it was more than a tragedy, emotions be grabbin' me
plane fell from the sky, we tryna figure what happened
burnin' churches, fearin' god, who can be so cruel
we all ignorant to aids 'til it happens to you
just be a man, make plans, listen to your voice
a woman's tryin' to make decisions, we should leave them a choice
cause who we to say who lives and die, breathes and stops
all this judgement on other lives needs to stop
what are we livin' for, givin' more back than takin'
on my knees still waitin' for my own salvation
now i feel abandoned cause pat buchanan say i'm greedy
you can take my taxes, send me to war but can't feed me
it's so easy to regret thangs after they done
babies catchin' murder cases scared to laugh in the sun
the tragedies that we all need, love in doses
in times like these we feel closest the good die young

does anybody have an answer why
(it times like these we feel closest)
it seems the good die young (the good die young)
can anybody tell me why
(rest in peace, god bless the dead, and we carry on huh)
can anybody tell me why
(the good die young)
does anybody have an answer why (i ain't quincy jones)
it seems the good die young
(the good die young)
does anybody tell me why
(now we hear from the future, the next generation, tell me)
does anybody tell me why


now in my world will it get worse
when i been trapped since birth
but i had to sleep in a hearse, cause it was my bed first
my grands probably burnin' turnin' in they grave
some folks ain't even get to see a high age
but they did, so i ain't afraid
and this money got me feelin' like a star
and this murder got me feelin' like my death ain't far
and the land of stolen cars, don't get no better
don't get no weaker or no harder
i was raised in a rush without my moms and my, father
so tell me somethin'
if i grab my gat and get the dumpin'
would god get to lookin' at me funny uhaha
rest in peace to my mother aquillah beale
rest in peace to my father salek beale
rest in peace to my grandparents
and thug in peace to my brother seike
you know i love you


which is worst, first storm and then al
pac and then yak
regrey brown
coulda' sworn i seen ya face in a cloud
family grievin' on your last breath
close to the heart whether you know it or not
i swear the love won't stop
jewel, that's my boo, mom, duke and nu
from jump you kept it true
helped to feed the crew
the good die young
livin' fast jumpin' the gun
mama blamin' the community for killin' her son
my cousin darren wasn't scared of goin'
but never knowin' he was dyin' slower
i guess i see ya when i see ya soulja

does anybody have an answer why (answer why)
it seems the good die young
can anybody tell me why (tell me why!)
can anybody tell me why


i know my life ain't promised
that's why the wise move in silence
analyze these scandalous times
it's hard dogg but we managed
schools turn to war zones
even homes unsafe
leavin' children to play caged and raged they hate
how come!, someone explain "why the good die young"
why the bad die slow and outlive everyone
it's time somethin' is done
for our young kids
they growin' hopeless
that ain't the way to live
tell me why


days go past and as they pass, time move, quicker
no time for wastin', put your hustle down my young dealers
cause the end is nearer
but at least that's what they tellin' me
hell, all i know brothers ain't ridin' four-three felony's
it's time to plan, plot, and strategize
capitalize, mobilize
we in the war y'all
it's for all y'all
my family to the ones that stand me
little bit mo' love is what's recommended
yeah, and it's plain to see (plain to see)
the seeds from you and me
gon' be the ones to lead us towards unity
that's if we treat them right
man, teach them right
raise your kids better than you was
and see what it does
but if you don't
man, we sure to be dumb
and we'll all see exactly why the goods die young
(we ain't lyin' man)

does anybody have an answer why (tell me why)
it seems the good die young (tell me why)
can anybody tell me why
can anybody tell me why
(the good die young)
does anybody have an answer why (tell me why)
it seems the good die young (die young)
can anybody tell me why (tell me why)
can anybody tell me why
(the good die young)


i send this out for all my homeboys that passed away
and all yo' homeboys that passed away
i send this out to all the former fallen soldiers
that's in the cemeteries buried
never got to see they dreams
for everything i touch you touch
for every step i take you take
for every breath i breathe you breathe
every dollar i make you make
i told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day
you just got there a little quicker
but like my homeboys thugs say
i'll catch ya at the crossroads
the good die young

this song is dedicated to all them
young kids that died innocent
that died young
at columbine high
rest in peace (oklahoma)
outlawz
(lil' yummy sandifer
tasha harlins, all them
all the fallen kids
the dead babies
the closed caskets)

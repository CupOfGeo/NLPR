(outlawz)

listen it ain't no stoppin' i gotta hustle
cop it make it double
try to stop it and touch it
i'ma cock it and bust it
niggas fuck it i'm tryna get it addicted to fast livin'
get rich or die tryin' nigga ask fifty
i've been operatin' under thug laws as a warrior
oppressed by the industry the hip-hop government
washed around by the hip-hop police
why you think nas screamin' hip-hop deceased?
no justice (no justice)
all the judges got grudges
givin' my niggas life for a little next to nothing
so wherever you are, just a little extra something
you ain't the only one, we all goin' through the struggle
penny pinchin'
it's like you really ain't livin'
resultin' on a two hundred and elevens, i'm cookin' in the kitchen
like we lookin' and we wishin'
prayin' will he hear it?
it's eatin' at my spirit
speakin' for the spirits


you can't break me, never make me busta soft the beats
this outlaw style got a brother off the streets
miss delores tucker sue me i won't stop
'til we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
time warner full of sissies, tell 'em all to miss me
a bunch of hypocrites whistlin' dixie
good riddance cause you never should of touched me
you cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure i'ma make you sorry
trust me
did i cry when they dropped me? (nah), can they stop me? (won't)
tryna sell four million copies
if i wasn't spittin' it'd be prison or death
this rap game all we got left
so try to comprehend where we comin' from
life as an outlaw, ain't meant for everyone
so here we come
recognize how we organize
strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
and we can't stop


no way no how we got to keep movin'
and puttin' it down
we can't stop
(outlawz)
until we reach the top
through the music we speak to the blocks
believe it or not

i don't know what you've been, told
real niggas don't stay on they go
can't stop until i get that you know
won't stop until i get that keep goin'


bury me with a makaveli suit and a mac
if god strike me with lightnin', i'm shootin' him back
skinny cause i won't work out, my man is in the gym
long as i'm strong enough to put a hammer on your chin
trapped in the storm, fuck the world 'til i'm gone
i'm buckin' at corey brooke he treatin' my niggas wrong
until i'm gone
they gon' see who i be
i picture this bricks duckin' from the penitentiary


see
mysteriously it seems
through my deepest thoughts and dreams
it's all wrong pop too long gone
and now eighteen i'm stranded on my own
abandoned here in the zone
protect my throne pow like a king, al capone style
fake no jacks on this grind
coked up with crack i get mine
livin' life as a don, guess gortex, louis vuitton


yeah your boys back with the proper team
when they think i'm wearin' red i'ma rock the green
on a whole 'nother episode
cops never heard of ya
the otherside'll hide down the block from the murder scene
catch ya man he dead with the fifth
when it's hot on nu he g-ride from the clear to the bricks
so gangster how he switched from the clear to the bricks
niggas hate it but they scared of the fifth

(and we won't stop)
outlawz!


no way no how we got to keep movin'
and puttin' it down
we can't stop
(outlawz)
until we reach the top
through the music we speak to the blocks
believe it or not

i don't know what you've been, told
real niggas don't stay on they go
can't stop until i get that you know
won't stop until i get that keep goin'

so when you see me they can give me a kiss
the one posin' with the frozen wrists
outlaw immortalized we survived and curst
so i claim it like i'm bangin' a turf

keep goin' (keep goin')
even when the wheels fall off we keep rollin' (keep rollin')
this hip-hop thing just won't stop
it's number one at the top of the charts
here to stay like 'pac
man i just can't let it go

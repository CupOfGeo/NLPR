all eyes on me
motherfuckin' o.g
roll up in the club and shit, is that right
all eyes on me
all eyes on me
but you know what?


i bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust
so many playa hatin' niggas tryin' to sound like us
say they ready for the funk, but i don't think they knowin'
straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin'
well are you still down nigga, holla when you see me
and let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
i got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
until i die; live the life of a boss playa
cause even when i'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
the futures in my eyes, cause all i want is cash and thangs
a five-double-oh benz flauntin' flashy rings, uh
bitches pursue me like a dream
been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
it seems, my main thing was to be major paid
the game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
one nigga's gettin' jealous, and motherfuckers die
depend on me like the first and fifteenth
they might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
we got four niggas, in low riders, and ski masks
screamin' thug life every time they pass - all eyes on me


live the life of a thug nigga, until the day i die
live the life of a boss playa (all eyes on me), cause even gettin' high
all eyes on me
live the life of a thug nigga, until the day i die
live the life of a boss playa, cause even gettin' high


hey, to my nigga 'pac
so much trouble in the world, nigga
can nobody feel your pain
the world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
my girl said i need a raise, how long will she last
i'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips
triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as i dip
i'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
i'm takin' off from the curb
the nervousness neglect make me pack a tech
devoted to servin' this, moet and pay checks
like akai satellite nigga i'm forever ballin'
it ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawlin'
sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
my devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
where you goin' i been there, came back as lonely homie
steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
it's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
it ain't funny niggas don't even know how to act, shit
what can i do, what can i say, is there another way
blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay
my little homie g, can't you see, i'm busta-free
niggas can't stand me - all eyes on me


live the life of a thug nigga, until the day i die
live the life of a boss playa (all eyes on me), cause even gettin' high
all eyes on me
live the life of a thug nigga, until the day i die
live the life of a boss playa (all eyes on me), cause even gettin' high

will i survive, will i die, come on let's picture the possibility
givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
i told the judge i was raised wrong, and that's why i blaze shit
was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
on my mobile callin' big shots on the scene major
packin' hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law
bitches i fuck with a passion, i'm livin' rough and raw
catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
live my life as a thug nigga until the day i die
live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin' high
these niggas got me tossin' shit
i put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
up in the benz, burnin' rubber
the money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
this criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
make sure your eyes is on the mill ticket
get your money, motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it
all eyes on me


live the life of a thug nigga, until the day i die
live the life of a boss playa (all eyes on me), cause even gettin' high
all eyes on me
live the life of a thug nigga, until the day i die
live the life of a boss playa (all eyes on me), cause even gettin' high
all eyes on me

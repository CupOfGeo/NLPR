started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill him
never figured that, that same nigga sell five million 
hit the charts like a mad man nothin' but hits
court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits 
dodgin' cop cars look how we come so far
picture a high school drop out 
rollin' a double r
house full of happiness, weed and drank 
way out, so when trouble tried to find me can't
never visioned living longer than my twenty first 
thought i'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
and though it hurts to see the change 
it comes with the fame 
watch them gossip in this silly game 
to all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night 
why's everybody caught up in pac's life? 
to all y'all niggas, conversating on my life
mind your motherfucking business

i remember that 
ay 
what's happening pac 
yeah i know we never got to meet 
but we know all the same people so we got to speak 
you taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a g 
and all the shit you went through 
meant a lot to me 
but when they locked you up for nothing it was shame to see
you we know the crack came and did the same thing to me 
i get along with real niggas it's the lane to be 
talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me 
and so i pull it out my pocket let it rain you see 
now they all in the court room blaming me 
see we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle 
power to the real niggas death to the sucker's 
money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em 
death before dishonour never talk to undercover's 
live by the same rules so i minus the tattoo's 
with the same sort of dude with the same short fuse

i want money in large amounts 
my garage full of cars that bounce 
moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts 
busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks 
they running off at the mouth till i fill it up with my pump 
they jump my automatic keep 'em weary 
while you fronting like you billy bad ass 
nigga you scary, i been knowing you for years
we was high school peers, in junior high
i was itching' to kill, and you was, 'ready to die'
while you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases 
busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places 
leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried 
bitches die in a hurry, still i ride, i'm never worried
mr. makaveli tell me to ride and i'mma ride
pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfucker's die
it's not the way i wanna live, my nigga it's how it is
only real niggas stay on top

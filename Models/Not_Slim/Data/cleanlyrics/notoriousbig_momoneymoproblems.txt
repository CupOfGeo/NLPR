now, who's hot who not
tell me who rock who sell out in the stores
you tell me who flopped who copped the blue drop
who jewels got robbed who's mostly goldie down
to the tube sock, the same ol pimp

can't stop till i see my name on a blimp
guarantee a million sales pulling all the love
you don't believe in harlem world nigga double up
we don't play around it's a bet lay it down
nigga didn't know me ninety-one bet they know me now
i'm the young harlem nigga with the goldie sound
can't no phd niggas hold me down, cooter
schooled me to the game, now i know my duty
stay humble stay low blow like hootie
true pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
and then ya yell there go mase there go your cutie


i don't know what, they want from me
it's like the more money we come across
the more problems we see




yeah yeah, ahaha, i'm the c-to-the-a-to-the-d-d-y

bag a money much longer than yours
and a team much stronger than yours, violate me
this'll be your day, we don't play

cause it ain't enough time here, ain't enough lime here
for you to shine here, deal with many women
but treat dimes fair, and i'm
bigger than the city lights down in times square

i don't know what, they want from me
it's like the more money we come across
the more problems we see

it's like the more money we come across
the more problems we see

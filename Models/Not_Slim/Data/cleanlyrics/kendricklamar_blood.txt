is it wickedness?
is it weakness?
you decide
are we gonna live or die?


so i was takin' a walk the other day, and i seen a woman-a blind woman-pacin' up and down the sidewalk. she seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. so after watchin' her struggle for a while, i decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? "hello, ma'am, can i be of any assistance? it seems to me that you have lost something. i would like to help you find it." she replied: "oh yes, you have lost something. you've lost... your life."




is it wickedness?

lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song, quote: "and we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'..."
oh please, ugh, i don't like it.

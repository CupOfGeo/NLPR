just look over your shoulders, honey!
yeah, i know
it's been a minute
got to know
just look over your shoulders, honey!
whenever you need me
just look over your shoulders!
whenever you need me
just look over your shoulders, honey!
yeah, you need me (woooh!)


i wrote my first bars in the car with stacy
how bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
big marbles, nigga
i lead this new generation, boy
don't argue with us
marvelous beat selectors, authors and novel spitters
and it's all for the literature
and it's all for the hideous
the nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh
i ain't afraid to say i need you, ah yeah (hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
i promise i'd never leave you, ah yeah
my life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes
i write for sure, my folks unite
soon as the flow get nice
the poltergeist that scare emcees
my prototype for every
my share of d's and r.i.p
she know my type of style is like my everything
apparently, my appetite stay famished
bite no hand that feed
the culture vulture die and bleed
my focus hold these thoughts and dreams
control this pen (look over your shoulder)
boldest lines in rhymes and things
devote my time and mind it seems
supposed to shine, remind i'm king
provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
the pro's the con's, the diamond rings
the forward time, but i'ma bring
the soul divine and cross between
what's your's and mine's, the gold, the green
the roads that show just what it mean
that grabbed shakur and by the wing
and fly before my vocal scream!
for hip-hop, look at my ziploc bag full of goodies
you chris rock
hit the pookie and pit stops
since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
just look over your shoulders
when they fuck you over
it's love, i know ya


(wooh!)
don't you know, baby?
don't you know, baby?
just look over your shoulders, honey!
whenever you need me
just look over your shoulders!
whenever you need me
just look over your shoulders, honey!
yeah yeah, you need me (woooh!)


shhh, look over your shoulder, get me?
'cause i done bodied the game to the point
niggas scared to rap with me
get burned until they anointed me
one of the kings of black history
and yes, i see the game is a little different
niggas lack simply
and bars and i spit 'em like darts
'til they puncture your kidney
you trash and it don't matter how much you gon' try to convince me
and you gon' make my gun cock until your hole night away
yeah, ohh
i'm the buddha, the ali baba, the believerer maker
so pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when i shake 'em
so rude, i'm so ice cold but i'm what you need to just wake 'em
while 'em crowns and medals on the wall waitin' for me to just take 'em
when i arrive, my theme music, gotta pound to it
and when i leave, even my shadow got a sound to it
'cause i'm the god, the harder, the martyr, the father
i spit the saliva, that's leaking the lava
completin' the saga while meetin' and greetin'
and beating you niggas completed-ly
conquer, extremely bark on a nigga
you see me, you deeply carve up a nigga, believe me
graffiti your arm up, you heebee, you jeebee
but, kenny, you brought up (you give me pity)
now give me the startup
you treat me, you greet me, you meet me with arms up
so sweet when i spit
heaven's deep, it was deep
i was sleep, now the guard's up, hmm
upholding the fundamentals
while most of you boast the rental
focus on what's most essential
spit bars to provoke your mental
do i have your attendamiento?
while i clap these raps like thunders
look over your shoulder boy and wonder


(wooh!)
don't you know, baby? (ooh, woah)
don't you know, baby? (mhm, mhn, yeah)
just look over your shoulders, honey!
whenever you need me (when you need me)
just look over your shoulders!
whenever you need me (whenever you need me)
just look over your shoulders, honey!
yeah yeah, you need me (woooh!)


with god watchin' over us
and me over your shoulders
(all you had to do is look forward)
but what you gonna do?
you pull the devil even closer
(why'd you pull the devil even closer?)
them clowns that you hang with
more ridiculous than white cleopatra
or caucasians telling blacks to go back to africa
but i digress, you're more, but you act less
why do you act less?
even still, when the weight of life feels like a boulder
(just look over your shoulders)
i'm here whenever you need me
when you need me
whenever you need me
when you need me


(wooh!)
don't you know, baby?
don't you know, baby?
just look over your shoulders, honey!
whenever you need me
just look over your shoulders!
whenever you need me
just look over shoulders, honey!
yeah yeah, you need me (wooh!)
(wooh!)
don't you know baby?
don't you know baby?
just look over your shoulders, honey!
whenever you need me
just look over your shoulders!
whenever you need me
just look over your shoulders, honey!

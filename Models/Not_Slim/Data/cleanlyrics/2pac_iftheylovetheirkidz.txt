if my enemies love their kids
only if my enemies love their kids
if my enemies love their kids
if my enemies love their kids
only if my enemies love their kids

hey, why have drama
nigga, your baby mama stay right around the corner
i could touch her if i fuckin' wanna
so why you wanna insist to diss
i got your name at the top of fuckin' dead bitch list
meet mr. makaveli's terror
mack of the year, thug of the era
death row and outlawz, nobody does this shit better
my lyrics explode on contact
best prepare for combat
ain't no stoppin' so bomb back
it's the last days, niggas is dyin' for bullshit
mac-eleven is heavy yet i'm ready to pull quick
niggas ain't ready for a brother that's livin' major
bear witness to a sick motherfucker that's spittin' razors
when i cut 'em they cut, when i stick 'em they stuck
my ambitions to bust, 'cause i ain't givin' a fuck
we tore the neighborhood up, look at all the shit that we did
murder's a life long bitch
if my enemies love they kids

you don't wanna die
and i don't wanna kill ya
keep my name out ya mouth
'fore a nigga have to drill ya
all my enemies buggin' for all the shit that they did
don't make me murder you nigga
if my enemy's love their kids

body's is wrapped in plastic
look at this, it's drastic
just takes a nigga with the right automatic to cause static
like a mossberg dumpin', and muthafucker do jumpin'
make 'em role of a bitch
like michael jackson, "wanna be startin' somethin'"
holla at my crew and they perish you through the cherish
got that ass in my sight
tonight i'm bussin' off the terrace with multiple gun shots
niggas is droppin' rapidly, bussin' clip to cops
them bitches is runnin' after me, tellin' i'm high
when they ask why i'm trippin'
out top of my drop, 'cause you know why, keep dippin'
on my block they sell rocks and box with frail cops
and then we buss shots from glocks, fuck cops
my only fear of death, can you hear me, it's comin' back
had enough of this bullshit world so none of that
i felt no remorse for all the shit that we did
niggas dyin' in, hear the sirens
if my enemy's love their kids

you don't wanna die
and i don't wanna kill ya
keep my name out ya mouth
'fore a nigga have to drill ya
all my enemies buggin' for all the shit that they did
don't make me murder you nigga
if my enemy's love their kids

muthafuckin' right
you niggas better wise up
it's a real muthafuckin' war nigga
you wanna get with me
how the fuck you gon' get with me
if you got kids muthafucker
if my enemies love they kids
i'ma let my lil' homeboys ride on you busta muthafuckers
'cause y'all don't feel me
eh yo mu, k, malc
ride on these bitch ass mothafuckers
ride on 'em!


i don't even wanna talk no more
losin' your life, what for?
facin' a young muthafucker who puts it down for the dough
get killed in front of your kids
god forbid if it happens
cuz the shit i'm on now 'til you pass on us rabbit
gotta survive by myself
but at the same time they rappin'
won't put my gun on the shelf
it keeps me livin' like heaven
but when the shit jumps i'm ready
'cause i already knew
you better get this muthafucker before we come get you
deep in my heart i think this shits bout to pop any moment
tryna do me like my parents but i'm a tougher opponent


this nigga scared
must investigate all i'm prepared
for all the drama, you said
for all them niggas you feared
you fuckin' busta, busta
let the evil or the money trap you and thats life at you
every second we comin' at you
and you the last one
when l-rock is tryin' cast on ya
cuz a young rida who would die
pump up and blast on the thug past you
blastin' on enemies passin'
gigglin' when they should have been figurin' who would be the last one, laughin' while i switch your wig
i gotta ask ya'll somethin'
don't you muthafuckers got kids

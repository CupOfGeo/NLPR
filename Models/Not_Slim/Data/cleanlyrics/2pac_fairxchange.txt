ladies and gentlemen! and gentlemen
this, is a jazze phizzile produc-shizzle 
jazze pha, jazze pha
my nizzle! 
my nizzle. ha!
outlawz! outlawz. twopac, makaveli!
(still breathin') yeah, woo - wooo-wheee!

a picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
pushin', pullin' and twistin' i'm on a mission got me on the mash
tried to dig, you was screamin' when i did
steady yellin' out spots for me to hit, and "aw shit"
soon as i seen her saw us playin' hide the weiner
wanna "freak like me", fuck adina
up and down is the object, side to side
make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, "can i cum inside?"
say you don't feel it that's a lie
you just scared to get this penitentiary dick
the trot caught your eye when i walked by
i said, "hi."
but you was so shy, i can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
you want me to lick it and even worse
got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange


you do me
and if it's worth it baby, i'll return the favor
and give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
a fair exchange, on everythang
and let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
open your eyes baby, recognize a player
give it up to me (give it to me give it to me)
a fair exchange, you know the game
we can do the damn thang, thang, thang

open your legs
got me marchin' like its a million, you tremble from the feelin'
look up, cause i got mirrors on the ceiling
and if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine
and just for fun, i betchu i can make you cum sixty-one times
close your eyes, let me heat it up
cause when we fuck i refuse to bust a nut until i beat it up
drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
baby throw yo' legs out the window
remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
and let me hit it where it counts and flee
remember me? "i get around," and i'm haunted by my "temptations"
sexual participation, my motivation
even though i like the way you work it
you don't deserve it cause you walk around actin' like you perfect
took a while but i finally got it, and like a boss player
bitch you ain't doin' me no favors, fair exchange


you do me
and if it's worth it baby, i'll return the favor
and give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
a fair exchange, on everythang
and let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
open your eyes baby, recognize a player
give it up to me (give it to me, give it to me)
a fair exchange, you know the game
we can do the damn thang, thang, thang

now yo' attitude ain't realistic
yeah it's true i'm gettin' pussy, but baby you gettin' dick!
and since you bein' laced with the penetration
it's only right to show a form of appreciation
instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
in bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin'
you said "take it" so i'm blind in my passion, how long will i last?
doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until i blast
and then i laugh as we lay back
see i wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
cause you actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
i had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
a true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
before i say goodbye, put an end to all the games
here's my number for another fair exchange


you do me
and if it's worth it baby, i'll return the favor
and give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
a fair exchange, on everythang
and let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
open your eyes baby, recognize a player
give it up to me (give it to me, give it to me)
a fair exchange, you know the game
we can do the damn
you do me
and if it's worth it baby, i'll return the favor
and give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
a fair exchange, on everythang

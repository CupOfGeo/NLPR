makaveli the don, break on 'em!
ah put ya, ah put ya hands on ya, hands on ya heater
hands on ya, hands on ya heater, hands on ya, hand


let it be prophesized; niggas'll die because your crew's goon
around the way niggas get murdered by the full moon
heard it in whispered tones
niggas is bold and they choose to roll
i kill 'em all, watch now, nigga, truth be told
westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
niggas dyin' by my thirty-yard, brains'll splatter
wonder why these niggas cross me, i'm certified crazy
so sick the world made me
now diggy-die, every time i ride is for reasons
hard to kill a nigga cause i'm comin' back like jesus
bow down to my ill nation, runnin' from drug cases
lookin' at my congregation so full of thug faces
momma gave a nigga breath, a life of stress
i invest in a vest and makin' niggas watch they every step
label me a threat and i ain't even got started with this shit yet
thug style, baby, hands on my pistol, listen
i'm a ridah, every nigga breathin' pay attention
'bout to show you motherfuckers how it feel to drop a body
a simple glimpse of my lifestyle, killuminati


(yo, makaveli, they can't stop you)
hold it down!

(yo, makaveli, they can't stop you)

after the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin' again
'til i make it, yo, my military be prepared for them bustaz
similar to bitches too scary, get too near me, we rushin'
visions of over-packed prisons, millions of niggas thug livin'
pressures and three strikes, i hope they don't test us
they pull the heat out, ammunition in crates
psssh! move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
they got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
its like im - dreamin', seein' scenes of me ballin'
participated in felonious behavior
cock the cocked forty-five, snatchin' niggas pagers
labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
we started out drinkin' forty's, moved to harder shit
god damn, now i'm a grown man, i follow no man
nigga got my own plan, and it's called killuminati


(yo, makaveli, they can't stop you)
(killuminati and we got you, got you)
killuminati
(yo, makaveli, they can't stop you)
hold it down!
(killuminati and we got you, got you)
(yo, makaveli, they can't stop you)
hold it down!
(killuminati and we got you, got you)
(yo, makaveli, they can't stop you)

i spend most of my time bankin', niggas
because they hate a nigga, comin' across fake niggas
but we made niggas, old school and i'm thinkin'
y'all some bitch made niggas and you steadily sinkin'
o-u-t, l-a-w-z, ain't nothing fuckin' with that
we bustin' back, comin' back for the stacks
laugh last, cash cash, all i want is the paper
givin' them fuckers tool whips, i rule haters
y'all can't fade us, we kill, steal and peal quickly
the boss niggas, definitely, put it down strictly
e.d.i. amin, until the law come for me
kill 'em all for shorty, 'ninety-nine killuminati


they got me thinkin' strugglin' and hustling's my only fate
toppin' grams on the kitchen plate
tryin' to keep that money straight
times is rolling three up these streets sleep
but when i crack, hammer cocked back, rapped in my sheets
my life's been crossed, crooked since a seed
it hurts, got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
preoccupied by the greed in this crooked life i lead
more funds to spend or bigger guns to squeeze
me and my thugs clock g's, sippin' naughty thangs
real as these tats on my body, and it's killuminati


(yo, makaveli, they can't stop you)
hold it down!
(killuminati and we got you, got you)
(yo, makaveli, they can't stop you)
hold it down!
(killuminati and we got you, got you)
(yo, makaveli, they can't stop you)
hold it down!
(killuminati and we got you, got you)
(yo, makaveli, they can't stop you)
hold it down!
(killuminati and we got you, got you)

uh, yeah! my homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
westside, westside
part two of the war 


cross this nigga here, now biggie tell me who do you fear?
ain't a livin' soul breathin' shall pump no fear here
my last foe flashed then i mashed his ass
bastard, fuck with me, bet i blast your ass
so many follow but can't reach me, caught in the maze
catch them, mimickin' my style tryin' to walk this way
impossible my posse droppin' you, we death row riders
no need to beg, motherfucker, ain't no mercy inside us
feelin' blessed, the richer i get, the more i stress
smokin' lye watchin' time fly, waitin' for death
dear god i been feelin' like i'm close to jesus
paranoid with my pistols close, smokin' trees
keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me 
watchin' niggas catch strays, shake, choke and bleed
me, a mercenary for the streets, check my pedigree
bustin' motherfuckers it's the thug in me
now niggas talk a lotta bad boy shit, then get to squealin'
bitch made catchin' feelings

outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
my homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
catchin' feelings

yeah, napoleon!


picture me sippin' on one-five-one
drunk than a motherfucker droppin' my gun
or high as a kite hittin' hoes for fun
but that ain't me, dog, my mind's now clear
and that ain't fair, dog, your heart pump fear
in the state i, shoot you better hide nigga, chute is near
and you know just as well i do 
you ain't no killer, so kill that, you wouldn't kill if you had to
we might wobble, but we don't fall down
we take the gospel from makaveli, pass it around
holla "let's hit", we gon' taste the power
we started the thug trend, the game is ours
now we coast together, put our thoughts together
won't question when we die together
cause the hour soon to come
kadafi trained soldier, i show you how to use your gun
bring it

we yellin' "m-a-d-e n-i-double g-as
motherfuckas, and we here to stay
from curb surfin', we workin' the industry, you kiddin' me
it's really nothing to me and my king, you see
we in the big things, eat a dick man, if you're hatin'
we're gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off, pay attention
screamin' "bye bye bitches, untouchable sound"
ride or die niggas, and we huntin' you down
representin' all the real niggas stuck in the trap
bangin' out with the po-po, tryin' to get to some more
street life, young strugglers racin' the clock
ain't no tellin' when it all can end, roll a rock
that's the world with feelings, this a man's world youngin
the bitches in business, so learn a little something
hey, stop runnin' your mouth, you're on the verge of squealin'
bitch made catchin' feelings

everybody's a gangsta, but don't put in work
instead of puttin' on the armor, niggas put on skirts
these drugs ain't helpin', it only makin' it worse
and the streets ain't got nothing for me but a hearse
i can't trust the church or the mobs, i can only trust god
and to tell you the truth i gotta ride 
i only roll with the real 
cause rollin' with the fake got my loved ones killed

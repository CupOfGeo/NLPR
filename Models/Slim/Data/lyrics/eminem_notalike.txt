Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Brain dead, eye drops<br/>
Pain meds, cyclops<br/>
Daybed, iPod<br/>
"May-back", Maybach<br/>
Trainwrecks, sidewalks<br/>
Payless, high-tops<br/>
K-Fed, iHop<br/>
Playtex, icebox<br/>
<br/>
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)<br/>
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)<br/>
Up on this mic, when we're on it (yeah!)<br/>
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)<br/>
That's how much we have in common (woo!)<br/>
That's how much we have in common<br/>
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Royce Da 5'9":]</i><br/>
I don't do Jordans and Audemars<br/>
I do explosions and Molotovs<br/>
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed<br/>
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust<br/>
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me<br/>
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spyder move like C Breezy<br/>
I don't gotta hire goons<br/>
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely<br/>
The sky is blue, the tires are new<br/>
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy<br/>
While these dudes tryna figure out<br/>
How to do a freestyle as fly as me<br/>
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G<br/>
Everybody doin' chick joints<br/>
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point<br/>
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel<br/>
Now everybody doin' Bitcoin<br/>
We don't got nothin' in common (no)<br/>
We don't got nothin' in common (no)<br/>
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups<br/>
On them uppers-and-downers (woo!)<br/>
I'm into stuff like doublin' commas<br/>
Find me a brother who's solid<br/>
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down<br/>
When the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down<br/>
We can not give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic<br/>
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower<br/>
Possible couple of dollars you powder sniff<br/>
Now you're slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics<br/>
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts<br/>
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit<br/>
Knowledge is power, but powerless<br/>
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it<br/>
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it<br/>
Hirin' strippers, prostitutes retirin'<br/>
We can spit it for ya advance<br/>
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants<br/>
You niggasâ<br/>

We are not alike, there's not alike us<br/>
<br/>
You say you're affiliated with murderers, killas (ayy!)<br/>
The people you run with are thuggin' (gang!)<br/>
But you just a wannabe gunna (gang!)<br/>
Like you was gonna do somethin'<br/>
Actin' like you catchin' bodies (ayy!)<br/>
And you got juice, lil youngin, you buggin'<br/>
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery<br/>
Bitch, you ain't plugged in to nothin'<br/>
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (pew!)<br/>
And gats cock, your partners better tool up<br/>
This has not to do with muscular<br/>
But have guns for sure, you better put a<br/>
Strap on, other words if you're gonna<br/>
Roll up with your (gang!) you're gon' need a arsenal<br/>
'Cause this bar is over your head<br/>
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrrt!)<br/>
Oh, you run the streets, huh?<br/>
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?<br/>
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself<br/>
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour<br/>
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na<br/>
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne<br/>
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun<br/>
And I'm talkin' to you<br/>
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly<br/>
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss<br/>
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie<br/>
I keep on telling you motherfuckers<br/>
But just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories<br/>
Jarred like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly<br/>
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off<br/>
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock demi-god<br/>
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little<br/>
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me<br/>
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew<br/>
Obviously, I'm not gettin' through<br/>
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, lettin' off like Remy Ma<br/>
Heavy artillery, Godzilla, harsh with a hard shell<br/>
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly<br/>
Only time you'll ever say I lost<br/>
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy<br/>
Just to try to get me off, and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick<br/>
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city<br/>
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy<br/>
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me<br/>
That I'll be the most hated, though made it<br/>
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it<br/>
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho<br/>
But now those days are over<br/>
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open<br/>
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion<br/>
I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan<br/>
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives<br/>
I blow eighty holes in you<br/>
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and<br/>
I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman<br/>
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole<br/>
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'<br/>
I double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and<br/>
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion<br/>
Invincible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals<br/>
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal<br/>
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals<br/>
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick<br/>
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable<br/>
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original<br/>
I consider me and Nickel identical, but not us<br/>
The only thing we have in common is I'm a dick and you suck<br/>
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other<br/>
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier<br/>
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older<br/>
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster<br/>
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster<br/>
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster!<br/>
<br/>
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)<br/>
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)<br/>
Up on this mic, when we're on it (yeah!)<br/>
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)<br/>
That's how much we have in common (woo!)<br/>
That's how much we have in common<br/>
We are not alike, there's not alike us<br/>
(Man, fuck this shit, let's go)

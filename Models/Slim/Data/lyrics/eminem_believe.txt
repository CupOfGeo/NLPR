And I started from the bottom<br/>
Like a snowmanâground-up<br/>
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you<br/>
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (get it?)<br/>
Sucker free, confidence high<br/>
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes<br/>
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (yeah)<br/>
Another day in the life (uh)<br/>
Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)<br/>
Now my community's gated and I<br/>
Made it and my neighbors say hi (say hi)<br/>
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now<br/>
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (way in the sky)<br/>
But I still remember the days of<br/>
Minimum wage for general labor<br/>
Welfare recipient since a minor<br/>
Look how government assistance has made ya!<br/>
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed<br/>
Put your temper to more use<br/>
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse<br/>
That should only give you more fuel<br/>
Show 'em why you're you<br/>
So close, God, it's like I almost got it<br/>
But close only counts in time, bombs and horseshoes<br/>
So I Unabomb shitâtick, tick, tickâno remorse, pew!<br/>
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick<br/>
That's why they call me firecracker<br/>
I grew up on WICâwick, wick, wickâwith a short fuse<br/>
I got some important news to report to<br/>
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite<br/>
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?<br/>
<br/>
Do you still believe in me?<br/>
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?<br/>
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now<br/>
And walk out, I will never let you live it down<br/>
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?<br/>
<br/>
Man, I know sometimes<br/>
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice<br/>
To me they're just ink blots<br/>
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise<br/>
So you might wanna think it over twice (yeah)<br/>
When you retards can roll the dice<br/>
But beef will at least cost you your career<br/>
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced<br/>
But this middle finger's free as a bird<br/>
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth<br/>
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned<br/>
How to incorporate a curse<br/>
Point it towards corporate America<br/>
Stick a fork in and turn<br/>
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard<br/>
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours<br/>
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it<br/>
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it<br/>
When your situation showed no improvement<br/>
I was that door, you walked over to it<br/>
I'm the light at the end of tunnel<br/>
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it<br/>
When that tunnel vision is unclear<br/>
Shit becomes too much to bear<br/>
Since "Cleanin' Out My Closet"<br/>
When I was havin' trouble with the snare<br/>
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered<br/>
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh<br/>
When you struggle with despair<br/>
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair<br/>
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your fuckin' switch, nothin' can compare<br/>
<br/>
Do you still believe in me?<br/>
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?<br/>
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now<br/>
And walk out, I will never let you live it down<br/>
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?<br/>
<br/>
Started from the bottom like a snowman<br/>
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that<br/>
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack<br/>
And I know that I always got Proof at my back<br/>
I called you "Proof" because I knew for a fact<br/>
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you<br/>
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so<br/>
Give me that apron and moâ<br/>
âtivation to go, Hussein with the flow<br/>
Fake fans left you two-faced at the show<br/>
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul<br/>
Layin' vocals two days in a row<br/>
True statement, hate to go down this road<br/>
But there's only one route to cross this bridge<br/>
So I walk in this bitch with loose change<br/>
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll<br/>
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'<br/>
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?<br/>
Use the tools you're given!<br/>
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt<br/>
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?<br/>
I used to play the loser/victim<br/>
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven<br/>
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet<br/>
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets<br/>
Fanny packs, hourglasses<br/>
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste<br/>
Man, in my younger days<br/>
That dream was so much fun to chase<br/>
It's like I'd run in place<br/>
While this shit dangled in front of my face<br/>
But how do you keep up the pace<br/>
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?<br/>
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off<br/>
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all<br/>
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grÃ¢ce<br/>
Still you feel the need to go full tilt<br/>
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill<br/>
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will<br/>
Do you still believe?

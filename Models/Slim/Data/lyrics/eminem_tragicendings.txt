I'm stumbling, I can't see straight<br/>
And it's my fault I got this way<br/>
I got my hands on something great<br/>
And found a way to mess it all up<br/>
I did my best, I tried to change<br/>
But it's just in my DNA<br/>
I got my hands on something great<br/>
And found a way to fuck it up again<br/>
Now I'm the one thing<br/>
You couldn't hate more<br/>
But you're the one thing<br/>
That I would die for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
All my life, I was told<br/>
I was never nothing special<br/>
I don't need to be reminded of it<br/>
Every other second<br/>
'Specially when all my self-esteem's<br/>
Already shot the hell up<br/>
Falling helplessly, I'm embarrased<br/>
And I don't want no one else to see<br/>
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit<br/>
Every time she yells at me<br/>
Selfishly indeed<br/>
But definitely doesn't help that she<br/>
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven<br/>
But makes life a living hell for me<br/>
She does that thing with her lip<br/>
Now she's melting me<br/>
I'm putty in her palms<br/>
I'm wrapped around her finger<br/>
A yo-yo on a string<br/>
She lets me sit there and just dangle<br/>
Until something better comes along<br/>
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato<br/>
I look like I'm in pain<br/>
But I'm okay, though<br/>
'Cause I know she loves me<br/>
My friends, what do they know?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skylar Grey:]</i><br/>
It's like I'm drowning at sea<br/>
Hoping that you reach for me<br/>
I know you're there but I can't see<br/>
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings<br/>
I'm dying to breathe<br/>
And all you do is strangle me<br/>
Such a beautiful relief<br/>
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings<br/>
Drunk off tragic endings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
In my moments of weakness<br/>
I openly admit this shit, I wouldn't normally<br/>
I'm extremely self-conscious<br/>
And enormously<br/>
Insecure and she uses it to torture<br/>
When she torments me<br/>
It only turns to ammunition for her<br/>
In this war<br/>
When she gets going, she don't stop<br/>
When I'm up, she's like a downer<br/>
When I found her<br/>
It was love at first encounter<br/>
Plus, somehow, she must've took the carton<br/>
Of eggs off the counter<br/>
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground<br/>
For me to walk on when I'm around her<br/>
But there's just something 'bout her<br/>
That makes me not able to function without her<br/>
How can I get out of it<br/>
When I don't know how to?<br/>
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist<br/>
Make a believer out of me<br/>
And show me the way now<br/>
Or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain<br/>
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain<br/>
I'm drowning<br/>
<br/>

It took a while for me to get it<br/>
But I think I've figured it out<br/>
She don't want me, she just don't wanna<br/>
See me with someone else<br/>
The idea of seeing me happy<br/>
Destroys her in itself<br/>
To see me falling to pieces<br/>
Brings her joy, brings her hell<br/>
But it annoys her to see me<br/>
Get this straight, then say "screw her"<br/>
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick<br/>
I'm addicted to her<br/>
She's tryna block the door<br/>
So here's how I do her<br/>
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer<br/>
This time, this piece of shit's running through her<br/>
I can see that right now, I'm running to it<br/>
What the fuck? Should've knew it<br/>
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?<br/>
As soon as I hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid<br/>
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it<br/>
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it<br/>
<br/>

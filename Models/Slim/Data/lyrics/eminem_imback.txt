<i>[Chorus x4:]</i><br/>
That's why they call me Slim Shady<br/>
(I'm back)<br/>
I'm back (I'm back)<br/>
I'm back (Slim Shady)<br/>
<br/>
I murder a rhyme, one word at a time<br/>
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine<br/>
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help<br/>
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?<br/>
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell<br/>
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail<br/>
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve<br/>
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf<br/>
I used to get punked and bullied on my block<br/>
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox<br/>
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less<br/>
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press<br/>
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed<br/>
Too upset, it's just too much mess<br/>
I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)<br/>
Grew up quick (no) was raised right<br/>
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right<br/>
You think of my name now whenever you say hi<br/>
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-<br/>
-T-E, 'cause MTV was so friendly to me<br/>
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me!<br/>
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?<br/>
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?<br/>
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down<br/>
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4:]</i><br/>
That's why they call me Slim Shady<br/>
(I'm back) I'm back<br/>
(I'm back) I'm back<br/>
(Slim Shady)<br/>
<br/>
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it<br/>
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music<br/>
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim<br/>
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe<br/>
<i>[Vocal scratches]</i> My name is Slim Shady<br/>
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me<br/>
The sensational <i>[vocal scratch "Back is the incredible!"]</i><br/>
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible<br/>
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet<br/>
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed<br/>
It's a sick world we live in these days<br/>
"Slim, for pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"<br/>
Geez, you guys are so sensitive<br/>
"Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"<br/>
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic<br/>
Whose eyes get so squinted<br/>
I'm blind from smoke in 'em, with my windows tinted<br/>
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em<br/>
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo scented<br/>
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4:]</i><br/>
That's why they call me Slim Shady<br/>
(I'm back) I'm back<br/>
(I'm back) I'm back<br/>
(Slim Shady)<br/>
<br/>
I take seven (kids) from (Columbine)<br/>
Stand 'em all in line, add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9<br/>
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine<br/>
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time<br/>
'Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy<br/>
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing<br/>
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?<br/>
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?<br/>
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think<br/>
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?<br/>
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things<br/>
'Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (AHH)<br/>
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger<br/>
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina<br/>
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz<br/>
It'd be Jennifer Lopez - and Puffy, you know this<br/>
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck<br/>
If this chick was my own mother<br/>
I'd still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her<br/>
And have a son and a new brother at the same time<br/>
And just say that it ain't mine - what's my name?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4:]</i><br/>
That's why they call me Slim Shady<br/>
(I'm back) I'm back<br/>
(I'm back) I'm back<br/>
(Slim Shady)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vocal scratching]</i><br/>
Guess who's b-back, back<br/>
Gue-gue-guess who's back (Hi mom!)<br/>
<i>[Scratch]</i> Guess who's back<br/>
<i>[Scratch]</i> Gue <i>[scratch]</i> guess who's back<br/>
D-12 <i>[scratch]</i> Guess who's back<br/>
Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back<br/>
Dr. Dre <i>[scratch]</i> Guess who's back<br/>
Back back <i>[scratch]</i> back<br/>
<i>[Scratch]</i><br/>
Slim Shady, 2001<br/>
I'm blew out from this blunt (sighs) fuck

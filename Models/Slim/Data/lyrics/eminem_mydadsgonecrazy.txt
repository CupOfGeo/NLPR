Hello boys and girls<br/>
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships<br/>
Do you have a daddy?<br/>
I'll bet you do<br/>
Who's your daddy?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
Daddy, what're you doing?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem and Hailie:]</i><br/>
OK then! Everybody, listen up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
I'm going to Hell, who's comin' with me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
Somebody, please help him!<br/>
I think my dad gone crazy!<br/>
<br/>
There's no mountain I can't climb<br/>
There's no tower too high<br/>
No plane that I can't learn how to fly<br/>
What do I gotta do to get through to you, to show you<br/>
There ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to<br/>
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls<br/>
I cut 'em off, I got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar<br/>
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed<br/>
Sunglasses with Elton John's name, on my drag wall<br/>
I'm out the closet, I been lying my ass off<br/>
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr Dre:]</i><br/>
Suck it Marshall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
So tell Laura and her husband to back off<br/>
Before I push this motherfucking button and blast off<br/>
And launch one at these Russians, and that's all<br/>
Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map, off<br/>
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?<br/>
Hailie, tell 'em baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
My dad's lost it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
There's really nothin' else to say I, I can't explain it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
I think my dad gone crazy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
A little help from Hailie Jade won't you tell 'em baby<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
I think my dad gone crazy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
I think my dad gone crazy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
I think my dad gone crazy!<br/>
<br/>
It's like my mother always told me<br/>
Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana<br/>
and codeine and goddammit, you little motherfucker<br/>
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'<br/>
Fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick<br/>
Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second<br/>
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record<br/>
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy<br/>
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose<br/>
Than quit bringing my flows, quit giving me my ammo<br/>
Can't you see why I'm so mean? If y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O<br/>
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo<br/>
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more<br/>
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hailie:]</i><br/>
Dad<br/>

My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise<br/>
And at the same time, can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme<br/>
See what you're seeing is a genius at work<br/>
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first<br/>
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue in cheek<br/>
I'd yank my fucking teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue<br/>
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once<br/>
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son<br/>
And walk around the rest of my life spit on<br/>
And kicked and hit with shit, every time I sung<br/>
Like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump N' Grind" comes on<br/>
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl inside of a<br/>
plane<br/>
Aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave<br/>
Screaming at the sky, 'til clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade<br/>
And that's pretty much the gist of it, Parents are pissed, but the kids love<br/>
it<br/>
Nine millimeter, heater stashed, in two-seaters with meat cleavers<br/>
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither<br/>

You're funny daddy!

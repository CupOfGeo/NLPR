This motherfucker, man<br/>
Just won't shut up, will you?<br/>
Talking 'bout I owe him<br/>
Bitch, you owe me<br/>
I'm promotin' you right now<br/>
Yo, let's put the nail in this coffin<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna be like this<br/>
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings<br/>
But I'm only being real when I say<br/>
Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (nope)<br/>
And old men have heart attacks<br/>
And I don't wanna be responsible for that<br/>
So, put the mic down and walk away<br/>
You can still have a little bit of dignity<br/>
<br/>
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino<br/>
An 83-year-old fake Pacino<br/>
So how can he hold me over some balcony without<br/>
Blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me?<br/>
Please don't, you'll probably fall with me<br/>
And our asses'll both be history<br/>
But then again you'd finally get your wish<br/>
'Cause you'll be all over the street, like 50 Cent<br/>
Fuckin' punk pussy! Fuck you, chump<br/>
Give me a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up<br/>
Tried to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up<br/>
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck<br/>
Dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'<br/>
You sit behind a fuckin' desk at The Source butt-kissin'<br/>
And beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances<br/>
And you can't even get the clearances<br/>
'Cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious<br/>
It's not that we don't like you, we hate you, period<br/>
Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn<br/>
Last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand<br/>
Now he's a buster? What the fuck's with that?<br/>
Get on a track dissin' us, kissin' 50's ass<br/>
And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me<br/>
Bitch, I got two cases and probation, fight me<br/>
What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man<br/>
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?<br/>
What you know about your wife slicin' her wrists<br/>
Right in front of the only thing that you have in this world<br/>
A little girl?<br/>
And I put that on her, when this is all over<br/>
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her<br/>
I don't know shit about no choppin' rocks<br/>
But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rockin' spots<br/>
Where you the only white boy up in that bitch just rippin'?<br/>
Pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'<br/>
Them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinko's<br/>
Just makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles<br/>
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer<br/>
Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers<br/>
What you know about being bullied over half your life?<br/>
Oh, that's right, you should know what that's like<br/>
You're half white; Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice<br/>
I'm eatin' you alive inside, Jesus Christ<br/>
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down<br/>
You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now<br/>
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch<br/>
Shoot 'em in the fuckin' headâgo ahead, bitch<br/>
Slap my mom! Slap the fuck out of her<br/>
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya<br/>
'Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke<br/>
If you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck<br/>
You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack<br/>
You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap<br/>
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous<br/>
You'll never know what it's like to be rich<br/>
Life's a bitch, ain't it? Raymond?<br/>
Here, let me break the shit down in layman's<br/>
Terms for you, just to make sure that you can understand it and<br/>
Canibus ain't using too many complicated fuckin' words for you<br/>
Here, let me slow it down for you<br/>
So that you could understand if I say it slower<br/>
Let it go, dog, it's over<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna be like this<br/>
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings<br/>
But I'm only being real when I say<br/>
Nobody wants to hear they grandfather rap (nope)<br/>
And old men have heart attacks<br/>
And I don't wanna be responsible for that<br/>
So, put the mic down and walk away<br/>
You can still have a little bit of dignity<br/>
<br/>
Hahaâ¦ talking 'bout I have motherfuckers callin' your crib<br/>
Bitch, you ain't even got a fuckin' crib<br/>
You ain't even got a fuckin' phoneâ¦ fuckin' bum<br/>
Threatenin' to shut me down at your lil' fuckin' Source magazine, if I come back on you and attack you<br/>
Bitch, you attacked me first<br/>
Take it like a man, and shut the fuck up<br/>
And fuck your little magazine too<br/>
I don't need your little fuckin' magazine<br/>
I got XXL's number anyways<br/>
And y'all can't stand it, 'cause they gettin' bigger than y'all<br/>
Oh, and by the way, how'd I look on the VMA's?<br/>
When you was watchin' me<br/>
From whatever fuckin' TV you was watchin' me from<br/>
From Bostonâ¦ the mean streets of Boston<br/>
Fuckin' sissy! And you got us scared up in here, motherfucker<br/>
Suck our motherfuckin' dicks<br/>
Oh! And for those that don't know<br/>
Don't get it twisted, y'all: The Source has a white owner

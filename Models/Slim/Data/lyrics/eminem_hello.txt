Hello<br/>
Allow me to introduce myself<br/>
My name is Shady<br/>
It's so nice to meet you<br/>
It's been a long time<br/>
I'm sorry I've been away so long<br/>
My name is Shady<br/>
I never meant to leave you<br/>
<br/>
You see that chick in the gym checking me out?<br/>
Any second I'm 'bout<br/>
To stick her neck in my mouth<br/>
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wrecking the house<br/>
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?<br/>
<br/>
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse<br/>
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out<br/>
Nope, guess I'll re-route<br/>
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch<br/>
Oh! Jackpot! Yeah, 'Open Sesame' mouth<br/>
<br/>
Down the hatch and the feeling you can't match it<br/>
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet<br/>
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet<br/>
A knapsack packed with like 40-some Xanaxes<br/>
<br/>
Shorty come back, I'm tryna score me some lapdances<br/>
I'm bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniel's<br/>
Formula 40-40 and 40s with bad capsules<br/>
The bad apple spoils the bunch I'm back at you<br/>
<br/>
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"<br/>
And are you menstruating baby, my little friend's waiting to say "hello"<br/>
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty's shaking like Jello<br/>
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"<br/>
<br/>
My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium<br/>
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em<br/>
It just becomes everyday extra-curriculum<br/>
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun<br/>
<br/>
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151<br/>
51 people asleep in my damn living room<br/>
Excuse me hun? But what is your name? Vivian?<br/>
I woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?<br/>
<br/>
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?<br/>
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one<br/>
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm<br/>
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from<br/>
<br/>
I find the package and I'm cool,<br/>
I immediately run<br/>
Like Speedy Gonzalez to see if I see anyone<br/>
Who might have a couple of threes,<br/>
I'm fiending for some<br/>
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum<br/>
<br/>
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"<br/>
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?<br/>
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow<br/>
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"<br/>
<br/>
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were<br/>
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good<br/>
Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word<br/>
I second that and I third,<br/>
Rush to emergency surgery<br/>
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased<br/>
<br/>
He's no longer getting them free<br/>
Hundred bucks for these Percodans<br/>
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully search the den<br/>
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him<br/>
<br/>
Tirelessly on the phone tryna rustle up muscle relaxers<br/>
For his back and a couple of Paxils<br/>
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumbling back<br/>
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack<br/>
<br/>
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap<br/>
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact<br/>
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap<br/>
Resuscitated and rejuved so fuck it, I'm back<br/>
<br/>
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"<br/>
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow,<br/>
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow<br/>
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say "hello"<br/>
<br/>
And so I'm saying,<br/>
<br/>
Hello allow me to introduce myself<br/>
My name is Shady<br/>
So nice to meet you<br/>
It's been a long time<br/>
I'm sorry I've been away so long<br/>
My name is Shady<br/>
I never meant to leave you<br/>
<br/>
It's like starting over<br/>
Clean slate

<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Feels like a close, it's coming to<br/>
Fuck am I gonna do?<br/>
It's too late to start over<br/>
This is the only thing I, thing I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is<br/>
Find different ways to word the same, old song<br/>
Ever since I came along<br/>
From the day the song called "Hi, My Name Is" dropped<br/>
<br/>
Started thinkin' my name was Fault<br/>
'Cause any time things went wrong<br/>
I was the one who they would blame it on<br/>
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan<br/>
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog<br/>
<br/>
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls<br/>
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft<br/>
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws<br/>
And the fangs been out since then<br/>
But up until the instant that I went against it<br/>
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shit stain I thought<br/>
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught<br/>
<br/>
"Do I really belong in this game?" I pondered<br/>
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?<br/>
So back and forth in my brain, the tug-o-war wages on<br/>
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form I was raised upon<br/>
But sometimes you gotta take a loss<br/>
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off<br/>
<br/>
You keep pluggin', it's your only outlet<br/>
And your only outfit so you know they're gonna talk about it<br/>
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah<br/>
<br/>
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times<br/>
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?<br/>
What I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story<br/>
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are<br/>
When I was afraid to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sia:]</i><br/>
I was a... afraid to make a single sound<br/>
Afraid I would never find a way out<br/>
Afraid I'd never be found (my dream)<br/>
I don't wanna go another round (but I won't)<br/>
<br/>
An angry man's power will shut you up<br/>
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love<br/>
Run out of excuses for everyone<br/>
So here I am and I will not run<br/>
<br/>
Guts over fear (the time is near)<br/>
Guts over fear (might shed a tear)<br/>
For all the times I let you push me round<br/>
I let you keep me down<br/>
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear<br/>
<br/>

Feels like a close, it's coming to<br/>
Fuck am I gonna do?<br/>
It's too late to start over<br/>
This is the only thing I, thing I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents<br/>
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?<br/>
And the pain spawns all the anger on<br/>
<br/>
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song learned who to aim it on<br/>
That I made a spark, started to spit harder<br/>
Shit-learned how to harness it while the reins were off<br/>
<br/>
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part<br/>
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"<br/>
Haters started to appreciate my art<br/>
<br/>
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused<br/>
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?<br/>
And the lights go out in that trailer park?<br/>
<br/>
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows<br/>
And I'm frozen 'cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from<br/>
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun<br/>
<br/>
So to the break of dawn<br/>
Here I go recycling the same old song<br/>
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2"<br/>
Than make another motherfucking "We Made You", uh<br/>
<br/>
And I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs<br/>
My demise and my uprise, pray to God<br/>
I just opened enough eyes later on<br/>
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make you strong<br/>
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt<br/>
Just havin' to balance my dang self<br/>
When on eggshells I was made to walk<br/>
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the<br/>
Strength to cause Shady-mania<br/>
So when they empty that stadium<br/>
'Least I made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done<br/>
<br/>
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted<br/>
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song<br/>
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more<br/>
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk<br/>
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fuckin' faces off<br/>
<br/>
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone<br/>
And to think I was a<br/>

Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear

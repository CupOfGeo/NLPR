Yo...<br/>
Same song and dance<br/>
Damn girl, everywhere I go<br/>
Same song and dance<br/>
I like the way you move, all over the globe<br/>
Same song and dance<br/>
Something about it, man<br/>
Same song and dance<br/>
In the pale moonlight Yo...<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by<br/>
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?<br/>
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya<br/>
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?<br/>
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster<br/>
The police constantly bugging you, non-stop<br/>
I walk up on ya, "Well, hello Tonya"<br/>
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck<br/>
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?<br/>
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat<br/>
I got your back<br/>
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back<br/>
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap<br/>
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap<br/>
In broad day, and no mask for this attack<br/>
I heard 'em say exact opposites attract<br/>
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back<br/>
C'mon<br/>
<br/>
Yeah baby, do that dance<br/>
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do<br/>
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass<br/>
That windshield's too strong for you<br/>
I said, yeah baby, sing that song<br/>
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing<br/>
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all<br/>
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?<br/>
Same song and dance<br/>
<br/>
The first victim I had, she was a big one<br/>
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun<br/>
She was the girl the media always picked on<br/>
In and out of rehab every 4 to 6 months<br/>
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts<br/>
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once<br/>
What an event it was, I was sitting in front<br/>
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns<br/>
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son<br/>
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns<br/>
Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun<br/>
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt<br/>
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want<br/>
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun<br/>
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention<br/>
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension<br/>
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention<br/>
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done<br/>
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her<br/>
With 66 inches of extension cord<br/>
<br/>
Yeah baby, do that dance<br/>
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do<br/>
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass<br/>
That windshield's too strong for you<br/>
I said, yeah baby, sing that song<br/>
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing<br/>
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all<br/>
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?<br/>
Same song and dance<br/>
<br/>
My second victim was even bigger than the first<br/>
Pop star, icon, the whole works<br/>
She played a little schoolgirl when she first<br/>
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers<br/>
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts<br/>
It irked me, it made me mad at first<br/>
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on<br/>
Was that I had developed a crush<br/>
I just didn't know how to tell it to her<br/>
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?<br/>
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or<br/>
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?<br/>
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk<br/>
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must<br/>
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just<br/>
Climb the gate, and ring the bell, like "Hello, my love"<br/>
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up<br/>
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?<br/>
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feeling you Britney<br/>
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one<br/>
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent<br/>
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you<br/>
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value<br/>
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop<br/>
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke<br/>
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup<br/>
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you<br/>
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot<br/>
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do<br/>
<br/>
Yeah baby, do that dance<br/>
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do<br/>
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass<br/>
That windshield's too strong for you<br/>
I said, yeah baby, sing that song<br/>
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing<br/>
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all<br/>
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?<br/>
Same song and dance<br/>
<br/>
Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing<br/>
Same song and dance<br/>
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding<br/>
Same song and dance<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Same song and dance<br/>
I know<br/>
Same song and dance

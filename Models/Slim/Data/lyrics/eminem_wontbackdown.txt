You can sound the alarm<br/>
You can call out your guards<br/>
You can fence in your yard<br/>
You can hold all the cards<br/>
But I won't back down<br/>
Oh no I won't back down<br/>
Oh no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Cadillac Sevilles, Coupe Devilles<br/>
Brain dead rims yeah stupid wheels<br/>
Girl I'm too for real<br/>
Lose your tooth and nails<br/>
Try to fight it, try to deny it<br/>
Stupid you will feel<br/>
What I do, I do at will<br/>
Shooting from the hip, yeah boy shoot to kill<br/>
Half a breath left on my death bed<br/>
Screaming, "F that!" yeah super ill<br/>
Baby what the deal<br/>
We can chill, split a half a pill and a Happy Meal<br/>
Fuck a steak slut<br/>
I cut my toes off and step on the receipt before I foot the bill<br/>
Listen garden tool don't make me introduce you to my power tool<br/>
You know the fucking drill<br/>
How you douchebags feel knowing you're disposable?<br/>
Summer's Eve Massengill<br/>
Shady's got the mass appeal<br/>
Baby crank the shit<br/>
'Cause it's your goddamn jam<br/>
You say that you want your punchlines a little more compact<br/>
Well shorty I'm that man<br/>
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man<br/>
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said<br/>
Settle your fucking ass down I'm ready for combat, man<br/>
Get it? Calm Batman.<br/>
Nah, ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts<br/>
Lines are like mom's CAT scans<br/>
'Cause they fucking go bananas<br/>
Honey I applaud that ass<br/>
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance<br/>
Ma, show 'em how it's done<br/>
Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah<br/>

Girl, shake that ass like a Donkey with Parkinson's<br/>
Make like Michael J. Fox in the drawers playin' with an etch-a-sketch<br/>
Bet you that you'll never guess who's knocking at your door<br/>
People hit the floors<br/>
Yeah tonight ladies you gon' get divorced<br/>
Girl forget remorse, I'mma hit you broads<br/>
With Chris's force like you pissed him off<br/>
Talented with the tongue motherfucker<br/>
You ain't got a lick in yours<br/>
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores<br/>
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers<br/>
Think you spit the rawest<br/>
I'm an uncooked slab of beef<br/>
Laying on your kitchen floor<br/>
In other words I'm off the meat rack<br/>
Bring the beat back<br/>
Bring in two extension cords<br/>
I'mma measure my dick shit I need 6 inches more<br/>
Fuck my dick's big bitch<br/>
Need I remind you<br/>
That I don't need the fucking swine flu to be a sick pig?<br/>
You're addicted I'm dope<br/>
I'm the longest needle around here<br/>
Need a fix up I'm the big shot<br/>
Get it dick-snots?<br/>
You're just small pokes little pricks<br/>
Girl you think that other prick's hot<br/>
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match<br/>
'Fore I sit back and let him get hotter<br/>
Better call the cops on him quick fast<br/>
Shady's right back on your bitch ass<br/>
White trash with a half a six pack in his hatchback<br/>
Trailer hitch attached to the back (dispatch)<br/>

Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rapping?<br/>
Does a bird chirp? Lil' Wayne slurps syrup 'til he burps<br/>
And smoke purp?<br/>
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it like you do when I come through?<br/>
I'd like you to remind yourself<br/>
Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic<br/>
Or you're the kind of girl that I can take a liking to<br/>
Psych I'm spiking you like a football<br/>
Been this way since I've stood a foot tall<br/>
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse<br/>
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw<br/>
Gimme good brain<br/>
Watch the wood grain,<br/>
Don't want no cum stain<br/>
Bitch, you listening? Tryna turn me down<br/>
Slut, I'm talking to you, turn me back up<br/>
Are you insane tryna talk over me in the car<br/>
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'<br/>
I'mma shit stain on the underwear of life<br/>
What's the saying? Where there's thunder there's lightning<br/>
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place<br/>
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times<br/>
In three different locations<br/>
On four separate occasions?<br/>
And you can bet your stinking ass<br/>
That I've come to smash everything in my path<br/>
Fork was in the road took the psycho path<br/>
Poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash<br/>
So hit the dance floor cutie while I do my duty on this microphone<br/>
Shake your booty shorty I'm the shit<br/>
Why you think Proof used to call me Doody?<br/>

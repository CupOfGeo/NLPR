<i>[Eminem &amp; Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Marshall! Sounds like an SOS<br/>
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!<br/>
To the Rapmobile â let's go!<br/>
(Marshall! Marshall!)<br/>
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!<br/>
Hurry hurry, step right up!<br/>
Introducing the star of our show<br/>
His name is (Marshall!)<br/>
You wouldn't want to be<br/>
Anywhere else in the world right now<br/>
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest<br/>
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless<br/>
Most hardest, most honest known artist<br/>
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)<br/>
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin<br/>
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden<br/>
With his own private plane, his own pilot<br/>
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges<br/>
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes<br/>
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches<br/>
Away from you, dear, fear none<br/>
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so<br/>
<br/>
Let's get down to business<br/>
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?<br/>
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down<br/>
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)<br/>
Let's get down to business<br/>
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?<br/>
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down<br/>
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)<br/>
<br/>
Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles<br/>
Gee willikers Dre, "Holy bat syllables!"<br/>
Look at all the bullshit that goes on<br/>
In Gotham when I'm gone<br/>
Time to get rid of these rap criminals<br/>
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best<br/>
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it<br/>
Flows too wet, nobody close to it<br/>
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit<br/>
The most hated on out of all those who say<br/>
They get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much<br/>
They make it all up, there's no such thing<br/>
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans<br/>
It just means so much more to so much more<br/>
People when you're rappin' and you know what for<br/>
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all<br/>
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!<br/>
<br/>
Now let's get down to business<br/>
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?<br/>
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down<br/>

<br/>
It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo<br/>
Two old friends, why panic? You already know<br/>
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes<br/>
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero<br/>
You can even call collect, the most feared duet<br/>
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette<br/>
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat<br/>
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set<br/>
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely<br/>
Ease over these beats and be so breezy<br/>
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?<br/>
How can one Chandra be so Levy?<br/>
Turn on these beats, MC's don't see me<br/>
Believe me, BET and MTV<br/>
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy<br/>
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me<br/>
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear<br/>
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here<br/>
But we ain't fuckin' around round here<br/>
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)<br/>
<br/>
Now let's get down to business<br/>
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?<br/>
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down<br/>

<br/>
So there you have it, folks<br/>
(Marshall!) has come to save the day<br/>
Back with his friend Andre<br/>
Here to remind you that bullshit does not pay<br/>
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay<br/>
And never go away, until our dying day<br/>
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)<br/>
So until next time, friends<br/>
Same blonde hair, same rap channel<br/>
Good night, everyone! Thank you for coming!<br/>
Your host for the evening (Marshall!)<br/>
Oh! Heh

<i>[Girl's voice is Dina Rae]</i><br/>
<br/>
You high, baby?<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Ya<br/>
Talk to me<br/>
You want me to tell you something?<br/>
Uh-huh<br/>
I know what you want to hear<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I know you want me baby<br/>
I think I want you too<br/>
"I think I love you baby"<br/>
I think I love you too<br/>
I'm here to save you girl<br/>
Come be in Shady's world<br/>
I wanna grow together<br/>
Let's let our love unfurl<br/>
You know you want me baby<br/>
You know I want you too<br/>
They call me Superman<br/>
I'm here to rescue you<br/>
I wanna save you girl<br/>
Come be in Shady's world<br/>
"Ooh boy you drive me crazy"<br/>
Bitch you make me hurl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
They call me Superman<br/>
Leap tall hoes in a single bound<br/>
I'm single now<br/>
Got no ring on this finger now<br/>
I'd never let another chick bring me down<br/>
In a relationship<br/>
Save it bitch, babysit<br/>
You make me sick<br/>
Superman ain't savin' shit<br/>
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick<br/>
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase<br/>
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face<br/>
Play no games, say no names<br/>
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face<br/>
I'm a different man, kiss my ass<br/>
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?<br/>
Kiss my dick, get my cash<br/>
I'd rather have you whip my ass<br/>
Don't put out, I'll put you out<br/>
Won't get out, I'll push you out<br/>
Puss blew out, poppin' shit<br/>
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out<br/>
Am I too nice?<br/>
Buy you ice<br/>
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life<br/>
What you tryin' to be? My new wife?<br/>
What you Mariah, fly through twice<br/>
<br/>
But I do know one thing though<br/>
Bitches, they come they go<br/>
Saturday through Sunday, Monday<br/>
Monday through Sunday yo<br/>
Maybe I'll love you one day<br/>
Maybe we'll someday grow<br/>
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I can't be your Superman<br/>
Can't be your Superman<br/>
Can't be your Superman<br/>
Can't be your Superman<br/>
I can't be your Superman<br/>
Can't be your Superman<br/>
Can't be your Superman<br/>
Your Superman, your Superman<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes<br/>
It's no secret, everybody knows<br/>
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what?<br/>
That's about as far as your buddy goes<br/>
We'll be friends, I'll call you again<br/>
I'll chase you around every bar you attend<br/>
Never know what kinda car I'll be in<br/>
We'll see how much you'll be partying then<br/>
You don't want that, neither do I<br/>
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys<br/>
Too much pride between you and I<br/>
Not a jealous man, but females lie<br/>
But I guess that's just what sluts do<br/>
How could it ever be just us two<br/>
I'd never love you enough to trust you<br/>
We just met and I just fucked you<br/>
<br/>
But I do know one thing though<br/>
Bitches, they come they go<br/>
Saturday through Sunday, Monday<br/>
Monday through Sunday yo<br/>
Maybe I'll love you one day<br/>
Maybe we'll someday grow<br/>
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho<br/>

"Ooh boy you drive me crazy"<br/>
Bitch you make me hurl<br/>
<br/>
First thing you say<br/>
"I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day<br/>
I don't see what the big deal is anyway<br/>
You're just plain old Marshall to me"<br/>
Ooh ya' girl run that game<br/>
"Hailie Jade, I love that name<br/>
Love that tattoo, what's that say?"<br/>
"Rot in pieces, uh, that's great"<br/>
First off you don't know Marshall<br/>
At all so don't grow partial<br/>
That's ammo for my arsenal<br/>
I'll slap you off that bar stool<br/>
There goes another lawsuit<br/>
Leave hand prints all across you<br/>
Good Lordy whoadie<br/>
You must be gone off that water bottle<br/>
You want what you can't have<br/>
Ooh girl that's too damn bad<br/>
Don't touch what you can't grab<br/>
End up with two backhands<br/>
Put anthrax on a Tampax, and slap you 'til you can't stand<br/>
Girl you just blew your chance<br/>
Don't mean to ruin your plans<br/>
<br/>
But I do know one thing though<br/>
Bitches, they come they go<br/>
Saturday through Sunday, Monday<br/>
Monday through Sunday yo<br/>
Maybe I'll love you one day<br/>
Maybe we'll someday grow<br/>

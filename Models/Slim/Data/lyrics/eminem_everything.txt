CD's ain't selling no more anyways man...<br/>
Look at SoundScan<br/>
I really don't think it matters if...<br/>
<br/>
Everything I do is number one that makes you two<br/>
And that spells trouble for me and you<br/>
'Cause that's how beef starts between crews<br/>
And I don't mind if I debut at number two<br/>
So why do you? If we make money<br/>
And why can't you be satisfied with what you do?<br/>
<br/>
It's like our legacy's pregnant, we're planting eggs every record<br/>
They're beggin' me to release a CD every other second<br/>
But don't expect it, 'cause every time I get hit with that question<br/>
I just deflect it, get Cashis or 50's record and check it<br/>
And Buck is out like get these motherfuckers out 'fore I smack 'em<br/>
Plus T.I. just dropped an album now, go out and get that one<br/>
And I got a whole stable of artists who's able and fully capable<br/>
Of holdin' a label 'til I figure out when I'm ready to drop<br/>
Or maybe not, Shady, look how hot you were on top<br/>
You were pop, you were so popular, now you're not<br/>
You're all washed up entrepreneur, how's it possible?<br/>
Well, it's not, if your little fickle minds would've caught on, but you didn't<br/>
See, I don't rap for the green, I mean, I ain't greedy<br/>
But I also know what it's like to be needy, and I will never<br/>
Go back to poverty, see, it ain't easy to try to step<br/>
Away from entertainment, separate it from CDs<br/>
And everyday it just seems like we're beefin', even the media's<br/>
Meat eaters, they gotta give you something to read<br/>
Or you won't buy it, believe what you wanna believe<br/>
Let 'em feed to you the BS, P.S., peace to T.I<br/>
You gon be 'aight and we out<br/>
<br/>
Everything I do is number one that makes you two<br/>
And that spells trouble for me and you<br/>
'Cause that's how beef starts between crews<br/>
And I don't mind if I debut at number two<br/>
So why do you? If we make money<br/>
And why can't you be satisfied with what you do?<br/>
<br/>
Peace!<br/>
Hold your head up on 'em!<br/>
You know how we do what we gonna do<br/>
When we do it and we don't give a fuck what you're doin'<br/>
We gon' touchdown! Back up in the private charter plane!<br/>
We gon' touchdown! You know we gon' get it crackin' man!<br/>
We gon' touchdown! I told you ain't no way to keep 'em quiet<br/>
With T.I. and Shady, baby, they gon' make a bigger riot<br/>
When we touchdown!

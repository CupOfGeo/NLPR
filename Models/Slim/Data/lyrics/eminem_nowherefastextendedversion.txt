<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas, another lone wolf gunman<br/>
Sometimes I don't know what this world has come to, it's blowin' up<br/>
This whole country is goin' nuts and the NRA is in our way<br/>
They're responsible for this whole production, they hold the strings to control the puppets<br/>
And they threaten to take away donor bucks<br/>
So they know the government won't do nothin' and no one's budgin', gun owners' clutchin'<br/>
Their loaded weapons, they love their guns more than our children<br/>
Shh, I think another one just entered in our buildin', and we'll be...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kehlani:]</i><br/>
Ashes blowin' in the air<br/>
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah<br/>
Wasted youth, always on the road<br/>
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old<br/>
'Cause the skies are black<br/>
But our heart's made of gold<br/>
Fuck doin' what you're told<br/>
We're goin' nowhere fast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track<br/>
This road is takin' me back<br/>
Down memory lane with this rap<br/>
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback<br/>
I'm simply stating a fact<br/>
I had Wembley Stadium packed<br/>
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast<br/>
Another terrorist attacks<br/>
Like a tariff blows half of Madison Square up, alas<br/>
We perish in the blast<br/>
But that isn't scaring us, we pass<br/>
Nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just-<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kehlani (Eminem):]</i><br/>
Ashes blowin' in the air<br/>
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah<br/>
(We don't give a... no, no)<br/>
Wasted youth, always on the road<br/>
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old<br/>
The skies are black, but our heart's made of gold (golden)<br/>
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year-old<br/>
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways; for MC's it's a funeral<br/>
When I'm devisin' this rhyme, 'cause I'm awake and you're mourning<br/>
That's why I rise and I shine like a new day has dawned on me<br/>
Gusto, guts, bravado, nuts and plus I kick up dust<br/>
And cuss a lot, I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle<br/>
'Cause some stuff that's awful, really don't mean nothin' although<br/>
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow<br/>
But if at times my heart it seems<br/>
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve<br/>
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer<br/>
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward, but where we're goin'<br/>
We have no idea, nowhere to go, but hysterical<br/>
It's gettin' warm in here, I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist<br/>
Just one spark and it's lit, but I'ma still get dark on this shit<br/>
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch-war machine<br/>
But you forced me in a corner, I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear<br/>
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe<br/>
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu, I send at you<br/>
A ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un and end up ruinin' your career<br/>
But when all is said and done<br/>
And at the end of my run, I'll just rewind clocks, forever young<br/>
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come<br/>
'Til the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was<br/>
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does, but I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause<br/>
This world's screwed, it's already fucked, and I'm on top, so everyone's just-<br/>

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no<br/>
Goin' no, goin' no, goin' no<br/>
Goin' nowhere<br/>

<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
You can't tell us nothin'<br/>
Hard-headed and we're stubborn<br/>
So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young<br/>
Who knows what the future for us could hold<br/>
Another shooter? Uh oh<br/>
No more tomorrows, we're done<br/>
And all we are is-<br/>

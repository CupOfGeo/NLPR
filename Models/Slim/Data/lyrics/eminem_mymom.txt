Yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Okay<br/>
Alright, aight, aight, aight, aight, aight<br/>
Yo, yo<br/>
Alright, I'mma lay the chorus first<br/>
Here we go now<br/>
<br/>
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs<br/>
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her<br/>
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs<br/>
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom<br/>
<br/>
My mom, my mom<br/>
I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom<br/>
Oh-ho, whoa-ho<br/>
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty<br/>
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um<br/>
Valium was in everything, food that I ate<br/>
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas on my plate<br/>
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak<br/>
So every day, I'd have at least three stomach aches<br/>
Now, tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her<br/>
Son grow up to be an under-a-fuckin'-chiever?<br/>
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either<br/>
"What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fucking seat for?"<br/>
"Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffing ether<br/>
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer"<br/>
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either<br/>
It was neither, I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought<br/>
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleeping<br/>
What the fuck you keep on fucking with me for?<br/>
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'<br/>
Go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra<br/>
<br/>
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs<br/>
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her<br/>
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs<br/>
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner<br/>
"You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?<br/>
Now here's a plate full of painkillers<br/>
Now just wait 'til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes<br/>
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make<br/>
That retarded fucking face without even tasting it<br/>
You better lick the fucking plate, you ain't wasting it<br/>
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again<br/>
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there<br/>
In one fucking place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving<br/>
And if you still ain't finished it, I'll use the same shit again<br/>
Then when I make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit<br/>
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?<br/>
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it<br/>
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit<br/>
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid"<br/>
<br/>
My mom<br/>
There's no one else quite like my mom<br/>
I know I should let bygones be bygones<br/>
But she's the reason why I am high what I'm high on<br/>
<br/>
'Cause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs<br/>
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her<br/>
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs<br/>
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom<br/>
<br/>
My mom loved Valium, now all I am<br/>
Is a party animal, I am what I am<br/>
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach<br/>
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes<br/>
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it<br/>
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it<br/>
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh<br/>
<br/>
Man, I never thought that I could ever be<br/>
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me<br/>
But that's actually<br/>
What has ended up happening, a tragedy<br/>
The fucking past ended up catching me<br/>
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?<br/>
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful<br/>
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it<br/>
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache<br/>
"Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?<br/>
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it"<br/>
But I don't need it "Well fuck it then, break it up<br/>
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up"<br/>
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'<br/>
I'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin'<br/>
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip then I fall in bed<br/>
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead<br/>
<br/>
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs<br/>
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her<br/>
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs<br/>
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom<br/>
<br/>
My mom, I'm just like her<br/>
My mom, my mom, my mom<br/>
My mom, my mom, my mom<br/>
My mom, my mom, my mom<br/>
My mom, my momma<br/>
Me momma, I like-a da momma<br/>
Haha, sorry Mom<br/>
I still love you though<br/>
Dr. Dre, 2010<br/>

<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Yo! I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'<br/>
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin<br/>
Calling all party animals, get<br/>
On the floor when I pop up on some Whack-A-Mole shit<br/>
In search of a chick who stacked them so thick<br/>
And implants are so big<br/>
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits<br/>
Like Anna Nicole Smith<br/>
Body's bananas and sass to go wit'<br/>
I spot you at first glance and go "shit!"<br/>
You wearin' those pants that don't fit<br/>
That butt won't ever give up<br/>
That's why you stick it out no matter what<br/>
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit<br/>
So, get on the horn, my saxophone<br/>
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow!<br/>
You just laugh and go heehee<br/>
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate<br/>
That's why<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts:]</i><br/>
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me<br/>
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)<br/>
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me<br/>
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too, yo<br/>
With me on it<br/>
<br/>
I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer<br/>
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea<br/>
The plan's to bring you to my house<br/>
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam<br/>
I'm thinkin' soon as trampolines so we should bounce<br/>
But you're out of your tube-top<br/>
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa<br/>
Yeah, you're a cute fox<br/>
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk<br/>
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg<br/>
But you must be Token if you think you're takin' over my quarters<br/>
There goes the dime into the jukebox<br/>
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll<br/>
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl<br/>
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball<br/>
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox<br/>
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw<br/>
But apparently, so are you, ma<br/>
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off<br/>
And that's why<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts:]</i><br/>
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me<br/>
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)<br/>
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me<br/>
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)<br/>
<br/>
Said can I take you home, where we can be alone?<br/>
Shorty, you the shit<br/>
Girl, I ordered you to sit<br/>
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit<br/>
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink<br/>
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink<br/>
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling<br/>
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million<br/>
'Cause real tits are still fun<br/>
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of<br/>
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya<br/>
Besides you're fire (I love) like a starter pistol<br/>
Crystal and slides huns, tonight I'm your pilot<br/>
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl<br/>
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club<br/>
So come on, baby, the night's young<br/>
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung<br/>
We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young<br/>
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house, screwin' our brains out<br/>
Like changing a lightbulb<br/>
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya<br/>
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up<br/>
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck<br/>
So ready, set, aim and fire<br/>
Yes, babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda, why I love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts:]</i><br/>
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me<br/>
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah me)<br/>
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me<br/>
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)

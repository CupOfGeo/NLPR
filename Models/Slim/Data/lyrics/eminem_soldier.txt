I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier<br/>
<br/>
Yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns<br/>
Never was a gangster, 'til I graduated to one<br/>
And got the rep of a villain<br/>
For weapon concealin'<br/>
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'<br/>
<br/>
Willin' to stick out my neck<br/>
For respect<br/>
If it meant life or death<br/>
Never live to regret what I said<br/>
When you're me<br/>
People just want to see<br/>
If it's true, if it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do<br/>
So they feel<br/>
it's part of your obligation to fulfill<br/>
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real<br/>
In confrontation<br/>
Ain't no conversation<br/>
If you feel you're in violation<br/>
Any hesitation'll get you killed, if you feel it, kill it<br/>
If you conceal it, reveal it<br/>
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets<br/>
Pull it, squeeze it, 'til it's empty<br/>
Tempt me, push me, pussies<br/>
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze<br/>
<br/>
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much<br/>
They won't budge<br/>
I'll never fall or fold up<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble<br/>
I will never slip or stumble<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
These shoulders hold up so much<br/>
They won't budge<br/>
I'll never fall or fold up<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble<br/>
I will never stumble<br/>
<br/>
I love pissin' you off<br/>
It gets me off<br/>
Like my lawyers, when the fuckin' judge lets me off<br/>
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off<br/>
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off<br/>
I'm a lit fuse<br/>
Anything I do bitch, it's news<br/>
Pistol-whippin' motherfuckin' bouncer 6'2"<br/>
Who needs bullets<br/>
as soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets<br/>
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully<br/>
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'<br/>
You can hurt 'em<br/>
And come back again and kick dirt at 'em<br/>
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds<br/>
Assault and get sued<br/>
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room<br/>
Everybody halts and stops, and calls the cops<br/>
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops<br/>
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot<br/>
You'll all get shot whether it's your fault or not, 'cause<br/>
<br/>
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much<br/>
They won't budge<br/>
I'll never fall or fold up<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble<br/>
I will never slip or stumble<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
These shoulders hold up so much<br/>
They won't budge<br/>
I'll never fall or fold up<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble<br/>
I will never stumble<br/>
<br/>
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em<br/>
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em<br/>
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence<br/>
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it<br/>
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it<br/>
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it<br/>
Don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest<br/>
I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped in two-inch<br/>
So ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock<br/>
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock<br/>
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen<br/>
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again<br/>
Full of controversy<br/>
Until I retire my jersey<br/>
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty<br/>
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me<br/>
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, I'm a<br/>
<br/>
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much<br/>
They won't budge<br/>
I'll never fall or fold up<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble<br/>
I will never slip or stumble<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
These shoulders hold up so much<br/>
They won't budge<br/>
I'll never fall or fold up<br/>
I'm a soldier<br/>
Even if my collar bones crush or crumble<br/>
I will never stumble<br/>
<br/>
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left<br/>
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left<br/>
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left<br/>
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left, right, left

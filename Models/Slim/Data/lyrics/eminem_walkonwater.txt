<i>[BeyoncÃ© (Eminem):]</i><br/>
I walk on water<br/>
But I ain't no Jesus<br/>
I walk on water<br/>
But only when it freezes (fuck)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
Why are expectations so high?<br/>
Is it the bar I set?<br/>
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach<br/>
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as<br/>
Soon as I grab, squeeze<br/>
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze<br/>
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackenin'<br/>
I know the mark's high, butterflies rip apart my stomach<br/>
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with<br/>
You're gonna harp, gripe, and<br/>
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these<br/>
As pressure increases like khakis<br/>
I feel the ice cracking, because<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BeyoncÃ© (Eminem):]</i><br/>
I walk on water<br/>
But I ain't no Jesus<br/>
(It's the curse of the, it's the curse of the)<br/>
I walk on water (shit)<br/>
But only when it freezes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set<br/>
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet<br/>
Will this step just be another misstep<br/>
To tarnish, whatever the legacy, love or respect<br/>
I've garnered?<br/>
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless<br/>
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark<br/>
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart<br/>
Like, "This shit is garbage!"<br/>
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless<br/>
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded<br/>
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive<br/>
And I try not to listen to nonsense<br/>
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence<br/>
Mission accomplished<br/>
I'm not God-sent<br/>
Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BeyoncÃ©:]</i><br/>
I walk on water<br/>
But I ain't no Jesus<br/>
I walk on water<br/>
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's, it's true)<br/>
But only when it freezes<br/>
(It's true)<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I'm only human, just like you<br/>
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew<br/>
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do<br/>
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess<br/>
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest<br/>
A flawed human, I guess<br/>
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your expectations and meet 'em, but first<br/>
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean<br/>
He's going too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?<br/>
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm<br/>
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on<br/>
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on<br/>
But the only one who's looking down on<br/>
Me that matters now's DeShaun<br/>
Am I lucky to be around this long?<br/>
Begs the question though<br/>
Especially after the methadone<br/>
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home<br/>
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn<br/>
The crowds are gone<br/>
And it's time to wash out the blonde<br/>
Sales decline, the curtains drawn<br/>
They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head from out behind<br/>
And everyone who has doubt, remind<br/>
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times<br/>
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes<br/>
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine<br/>
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight<br/>
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?<br/>
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine<br/>
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine<br/>
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BeyoncÃ©:]</i><br/>
I walk on water<br/>
But I ain't no Jesus<br/>
I walk on water<br/>
But only when it freezes<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I'm only human, just like you<br/>
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew<br/>
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do<br/>
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh<br/>
If I walked on water, I would drown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
'Cause I'm just a man<br/>
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike<br/>
So me and you are not alike<br/>
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"

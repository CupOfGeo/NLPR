yeah


oh


this game's like cocaine


i want this more than anything in the world


ha, so do i. at least i thought i did.


got to have it
yeah, i made it
im addicted
yeah, im feigning


this is a beat with no words at first
it's a blank painting
exercising the mind is brain strength training
starts off with something, like shady's an insane maniac,
yeah, slim shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?
now all you need's an image to go with the name, baby
wife beaters and white t-shirts, hanes mainly
it's a long shot, but is it possible there's a lane, maybe?
if not, he's gonna have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
he wants the fame so bad he can taste it
he could see his name up in lights
women screaming his fuckin name, fainting
shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
joe schmoe made it, he took his plain jane lady and his baby hailie out the trailer
but he aint trailing anymore, hes ahead of the race
while maintaining his innocence
little does he know, his train is derailing
and hes about to be raped by this game anally


what would you do for a little bit?
what would you give for a little hit?
for that c.o.c.a.i.n.e.
'cause once you get in, you don't wanna leave

got to have it
yeah, i made it
i'm addicted
yeah, i'm feigning


youre operating on all cylinders
syllables spit like dillingers spilling ya guts
people are feeling ya mic skills, but these haters are ice grillin ya
willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
fake friendsll kill for ya, die for ya
but you cant decipher why? for the life of ya
it wasnt like this when you were cypherin
argue wit your wife again
she found vicodin in your pants last night again
your disputes public, nothing is private anymore
oh, and your best friend? say bye-bye to him
what kinda apple you take a bitea, slim?
(this is what you wanted marshall, aint it?)
fuck no!
the way that it turned out was nothin like the picture that i painted in my head
sometimes a dream to make it, its more fun than it is to actually make it
the game stripped me naked
it robbed me ever having another real relation-
-ship, with another girl
this world is a fuckin trip
cause i slip in another world, proceed, take another hit
sniff til i fuckin hurl, tell em all to fuckin sit
and spin til they fuckin twirl, middle finger up again
relapsing back in this game
oh well, fuck it, then


what would you do for a little bit?
what would you give for a little hit?
for that c.o.c.a.i.n.e.
cause once you get in, you don't wanna leave

got to have it
yeah, i made it
im addicted
yeah, im feigning



start off right
just to see your name in lights
just so you can live the life
you take a bite
and lose your sight
they call this (fame)

you think you good (ha ha)
just cause you got out the hood
concerned only with getting dough,
no longer poor but lost your soul they call this.. (fame)

i hear it callin'
my name is callin'
why you strugglin'
when you could be ballin'
my head is sayin' yeah
but my feet is stallin'
so many walk in
but any fallin'
but i got to have it
like eve and the apple
she had to grab it
i got to take it
i got to make it
that's the plan
and i can't forsake it.


what would you do for a little bit?

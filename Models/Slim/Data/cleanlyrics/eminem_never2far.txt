i'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
but just an mc, so listen to me, but if you disagree
you missing the key, you ain't even in the brisk of the tea
unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
my objects were never to swab decks

the few that i trust, thems the people that i still got
fuck with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot
the five elemantz for life my man thyme
proof, kyu and denaun, we move through into time
my crews true and divine, we never fronted
we just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
it's all about a man planning what his future is
what he can do for his to be a star

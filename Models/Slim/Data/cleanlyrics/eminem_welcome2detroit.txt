homie it's been a long time comin' and i'm straight with that
marshall call me the fifty ?? and laced the track
this the beat, you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
my bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
my name is trick trick, head of the goon squad
and gangsta been bangin' the underground since 'ninety-five, we're bangin'
elected to be the villain and certified a menace
holdin' it down since i paroled up outta prison
you heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
all the treacherous, evil deeds of the d you never see
pickin' that kid up in the game, i just wasn't chasin' the fame
i been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
a quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
and my boy holdin' me up, shady done put it out
trick trick and eminem, detroit back in the house




ayo em, you ever need one of these weapons come get it
from now on every beef that you get in, homie i'm in it
i been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
i been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
so it's evident, it's time for trick to get it fast
the public, see they appreciate my criminal past
authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
i'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
and i freak from the precinct for violent crimes
i ain't sayin' the shit that i'm sayin' so girls can fear me
only speakin' on what i know so the world can hear me
so peace to jimmy and dre for signin' my nigga
he reached back to detroit and grabbed a winner
so the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
and beat the hell outta anybody that fuck with us




yeah, trick trick

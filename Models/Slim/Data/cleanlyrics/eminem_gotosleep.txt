i ain't gonna eat, i ain't gonna sleep
ain't gonna breathe, 'til i see what i wanna see
and what i wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
permanently, you just being hurt
this ain't gonna work for me
it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
cause we, are just gonna be, enemies
as long as we breathe, i don't ever see, either of us
coming to terms, where we can agree
there ain't gonna be, no reasoning, speaking wit me
you speak on my seed, then me, no speak-a ingles
so we gonna beef, and keep on beefing, unless
you're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
and settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
a demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
and you're gonna see, this gangster pee on himself
i see you dtwelve, and thanks, but me need no help
me do this one all by my lonely
i don't need fifteen of my homies
when i see you, i'm seeing you, me and you only
we never met, but best believe you gon' know me
when i'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
come on bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
you was gonna do, that's what i thought, you're pitiful
i'm rid of you, all of you, ja, you'll get it too!


now go to sleep bitch
die, motherfucker, die
ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
go to sleep, bitch (what)
why are you still alive
how many times i gotta say, close ya eyes
and go to sleep bitch (what)
die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye
go to sleep bitch (what)
why are you still alive
why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah

we got you niggas nervous
on purpose, to hurt your focus
you's not mc's, you's worthless
you's not them g's, you's a circus
you's no appeal, please
you's curtains, you use words kool herc slurred in two thousand third
you's purping, you's no threat, who's ya serving
when lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
you fuck with a label overseeing the earth
shady muthafucka, o. trice's birth
and as i mold, i become a curse
so we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
depicts fiction in his verse
and as i breathe, and you be deceased
the world believe you deceived just to speak
you's not the streets, you's the desk
use not your chest nigga, use a vest
before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth




hey dog, i'mma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
i'mma stay blazing new york with the heat
stalk on the beat, walk with my feet
understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet
peep how i'm moving, peep where i'm going
shit don't seep, then sleep not knowing
but i'mma keep growing, getting larger than life
easy going with the same one that started the fight
he be knowing how dog get, when dog don't bite
tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
grand champ, and my blood line is tight
cuz it's all good, it's all right
niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
blood line, and, we can go track for track
damn, dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that
